As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.

I should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character. The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.

So right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.

None of that happened. Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here. I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.

What kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.

I’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times. I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books. I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.

The team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit. They did their homework. Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War. But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive. Kudos to you.

I’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot. The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor. What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.

I wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble. I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked. Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time. Magical.

Okay, the game isn’t perfect. The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening. I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking. Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.

The hoplite battles were a major disappointment. The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation. Shoulder to shoulder. Shield to shield. The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all. Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.

Also I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family. By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not. I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.

I won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose. Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.

If you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game. You won’t be disappointed.

I'm not an AC fan, so I don't give a crap that this isn't a traditional AC game. I just wanted to play as an Ancient Greek warrior, and that's what I got

After my experience with AC: Origins, I was reluctant to buy this game. It looked almost the same as Origins to me, and as somebody who wasn't particularly fond of Origins, that wasn't a good sign. Nevertheless, I had quite a bit of money left in my Steam wallet so I decided to buy it.

I can safely say that I don't regret my purchase. This game is remarkable and has been a massive surprise to me. It took everything that Origins had, made it better, and threw in some of its own stuff as well. It feels a lot more fleshed out than any of the previous games in the entire franchise.

Graphics

Unsurprisingly, the game world is beautifully designed. I loved Origins' game world, but I have to say that Odyssey's game world is a lot better. It is a lot more vibrant, and it is incredibly easy to get lost in it. There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to explore.

The map mostly consists of islands and has you sail from island to island with your own ship. The islands are placed in appropriate distances, making travel between them not too much of a hassle. The map is huge. I'm 76 hours in and I haven't fully discovered it all yet. The amount of detail they put into it is nothing short of incredible.

The game's cinematography overall is a major improvement from Origins. Cutscenes are a lot more interesting to watch through and generally make the game more engaging. Animations, although not perfect, are still better from previous games, aside from a few over-exaggerated animations. My main issue in the graphical department is the poor rendering. Textures can sometimes fail to load in properly and the draw distance is far from impressive.

Story

The story in Odyssey is surprisingly quite good for the most part. You have the choice of playing as Alexios or Kassandra. It doesn't really make too much of a difference which one you play, so for my playthrough I chose Kassandra. Either way, you play as a mercenary in ancient Greece during the Pelponesian War, a time of great struggle between the Athenians and the Spartans.

The story starts off basic but it begins to escalate pretty quickly. The first chapter of the game is brilliantly concluded, and after that I found myself hooked. There are three story branches that the game has you follow. You acquire these new branches as you progress through the story. I'm not going to talk about these branches in this review because I honestly think you should discover what they are for yourselves when you play this. What they are, and the way they are revealed, are brilliant. The more you go through the game, the more content is available to you. It can get overwhelming sometimes.

Mutliple choice dialogue is a brilliant addition to Assassin's Creed in my opinion and it makes you feel like you have way more of an impact on the story and the characters. It may not drastically change the course of the game, but the things you say do have consequences.

Does the story retain this level of charm? No, not really. Once you reach the half way point of the game, it begins to fall a bit flat. It's not that it becomes bad, it's just not as good. The level of mystery begins to become a bit stale and the structure of the main quests begins to be a little repetitive. You find yourself having to do other needless things before being able to do the main quest, which can get annoying. As well as this. the ending to the main story branch is a bit weak, and honestly a bit cheesy.

The outside Animus story returns, which was something that was incredibly forgetable in Origins. It's still not that great, but it's more interesting in Odyssey and the conclusion to it is excellent.

Despite that, the story overall is good, and that goes for all three story branches. The writing in Odyssey is engaging and I find myself liking the missions and the characters, which is something that Origins struggled to do for me.

Gameplay

If you've played Origins, you will notice a lot of similarities when it comes to gameplay. The combat is very similar, and some of the other game mechanics that were in Origins are present in Odyssey as well. What makes them different in Odyssey, is that they've been drastically improved. The game has fully embraced its RPG side which means it isn't holding back on anything.

You can play the game using guided mode, or exploration mode. Guided mode is essentially what Origins was with a compass and icons pointing to where you need to go. Exploration mode removes all of this and makes you figure out where you need to go with the tips you've been given from talking to people or finding notes or letters. This makes the game a lot more challenging and serves as a way more memorable experience to say the least.

Just like Origins, the combat is really entertaining. You can fight using a variety of different weapons and the introduction of combat abilities makes these fights a lot more exhilarating. You gain a skill point each time you level up which can be used to invest in these abilities.

Executions aren't as impressive in this game as they were in previous titles. Sometimes the animations don't exactly line up, resulting in the whole thing looking goofy. Assassination executions can sometimes screw you over and get you spotted by other enemies, which can get pretty annoying.

Sea combat is a much more prominent feature in this game since a big portion of the map is ocean. Sea combat was something that I wasn't a fan of in previous games, but Odyssey has done it almost perfectly. It's simple, and it can be really exciting. Your ship can be upgraded using resources, and the more you upgrade, the better your ship can sustain itself. During your travels, you can recruit new people to join your ship. These people will give your ship bonuses and will assist you in boarding other ships.

The game world is split into different regions. Each region is either controlled by the Athenians or the Spartans. One of Odyssey's new game mechanics is the implementation of conquest battles. To unlock a conquest battle, you need to weaken the hold of the controlling faction. Once a conquest battle is unlocked, you can begin a massive battle that will decide who controls the region. You have the ability to choose which side you want to be with.

As well as this, Odyssey introduces bounty hunters. If you commit a crime and it has been witnessed, you risk placing a bounty on yourself. This will send a bounty hunter after you. They are smart and very powerful, and can show up when you least expect it.

Grind?

I needed to include this as for me, this was a major issue in Origins, and almost made me give up on it. Throughout my playthrough, I rarely had the need to grind, and when I did, it was hardly any hassle for me at all, as the ways you can level up are plentiful and entertaining. The amount of XP you gain increases the more you level up, which is a brilliant way to tackle grind. If you don't rush, you shouldn't have an issue.

Final Recommendation

I'm running out of room to type things so I'll conclude it here. Overall, I'm really pleased with this game. I'm glad it didn't end up being an Origins 2.0. The writing is good and the characters are memorable. The game world is stunning and is filled with things to do. The only things that drag this game down for me are the poor rendering and the poor mid-late story pacing. If you're willing to pay the price tag, this is definitely a game you shouldn't miss.

Pros
-Stunning Game World
-Interesting Story
-Well thought-out RPG mechanics
-Tons of things to do
-Exhilarating Combat

Cons
-Lame mid-late game pacing
-Poor rendering
-Executions aren't great

Final Rating - 8.6/10

Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Origins, with which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNA.

I played nearly 100 hours of Origins but was surprised it received nearly universal praise. Origins is more polished than a typical AC game due to its extra year of development time, and the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderful, but I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealth, combat, and story. Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things. With Origins, it was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’s, but the game was very polished. It ran well and looked gorgeous.

The universal praise Origins received was only skin-deep, full of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core. Odyssey, then, reminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity; an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous game's rough edges.

IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: If you liked Origins and want more of something similar, then you’ll probably love Odyssey. It’s just Origins with added light roleplaying, MUCH better combat, more practical skill trees, and some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new setting.

For more detail, feel free to read on.

The most hyped aspect of the game is its expanded RPG elements. Since Unity, which introduced customizable gear, there have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed series, including the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate. Continuing this trend, Odyssey has become a full-blown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements. It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development as, superficially, roleplaying and story are more developed. However, a lot of this comes to naught, because most of the side quests are still boring, filler fetch quests, and a lot of the "decisions" you have to make are little more than window-dressing: the illusion of choice rather than actual choice. I reloaded saves only to realize that the same thing happens in most instances no matter which choice you make. While it's nice to have the option to select dialogue this time around, story and roleplaying still clearly need more work put into them to deliver on the promise of better story and writing.

Combat in Origins was one of my chief complaints. The animations felt stilted and artificial, and the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played. The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great. Combat in Odyssey, however, has several more layers of polish. Animations seem more natural, dodging takes place over a judgeable distance, easy countering is back. Adding depth are Adrenal Skills, which basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins. There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill tree, with each providing a different facet than the other.

The skill tree is greatly improved from Origins, which had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly. Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree (different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlocks), which gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear. It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tacked-on because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game”. The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplay.

A lot of the new abilities feel inspired by WB’s Shadow of Mordor series. Chiefly among this inspiration, though, is a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system. Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, and this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at one-another; chiefly Athens and Sparta. Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a living, breathing war going on around you. Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actions, with each city’s forces being easily identifiable, and each occupying different fortresses as they move. They have leaders, cities you can disrupt, money and materiel you can steal and destroy. There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow games, and somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it. It’s the main draw of Odyssey, and it’s a huge one. It all works smoothly, indicative of significant polish, and the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Origins.

There are a number of more minor new features which fixed complaints I had about Origins. Number one of which is a dedicated (though limited to the open world) Quicksave feature for the first time in the Assassin’s Creed series. As a hardcore stealth fan I despise any game that features stealth without quicksaving and makes me rely on checkpoints. It’s too easy to experience a bug (especially in AC games) and have your entire stealth run of a fort become ruined. This alleviates it, and it’s a fantastic quality-of-life addition. There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruiting, deepening stealth gameplay.

History blurbs are also back! This eliminates one of my chief personal complaints about Origins: Ripping out these history blurbs and putting them in a separate gameplay mode from the main game. As a fan of historical fiction I want to learn about these settings as I play, and Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me. They are now back as a map feature, allowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of background.

I do have some complaints, though. The balance of the game is off, requiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am. The leveling system is also far too rigid, turning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges. This should be addressed in a future balance patch. It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveled, but I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustrated.

The game also removed shields from combat, which is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield. I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them go.

The game also runs questionably—my 1080 couldn’t hold 60 fps on ultra settings at 1080p. It needs a performance patch.

In the end, much of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical. You have a pet bird to scout with. The running and climbing animations are the same. The buildings look similar. The graphics are of the same quality. But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deep.

Odyssey fixes Origins’ faults and adds solid new features. If you liked Origins or you’re a fan of the series then you’ll love Odyssey. It's the culmination of what the past 3-4 Assassin’s Creed games have been introducing, and it’s become one of my favorites in the series.

Odyssey is truly a long and adventurous journey


⏰ How long to beat Assassin's Creed: Odyssey:
- Main Story - 43½ Hours
- Main + Extras - 83 Hours
- Completionist - 137 Hours

By this point, this is the longest Assassin's Creed I've played to date, with over what I was hoping to be. The world itself is massive, and you will spend close to what I've spent, if not more, if you want to repeat the game on Game Plus on the other character (Kasandra or Alexios).

In the beginning, the game felt nothing like Assassin's Creed and the whole direction really left me feeling a bit empty as I didn't click right away with Alexios. It took me at least 50 hours into the game to get used to him and how he was as a character to later in the game actually appreciate, value and really like who he has become.

The main campaign was nice, but what really topped up my entire enjoyment was the DLC's that I will be talking about later in this review.

⚔ Gameplay:

🔲 It's a one-time experience
☑️ Only for achievements
🔲 If you wait a few months/years (try playing with mods)
🔲 Definitely
🔲 Infinitely replayable

The game contains a lot of side quests and side missions that will keep you engaged for over 150 hours if you're a completionist. If you want to replay the game, you can seek the Game Plus after you finish the whole game, but unless you want to see the alternative, I don't see why you'd want to do it.
The game itself expands on the previous instalment AC: Origins, intending to upgrade it. Unfortunately for me, I feel that Origins was a superior game in terms of gameplay as I enjoyed more the setting and the skills in the game early in the game.

😄 Fun:

🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry
🔲 Hard to enjoy
☑️ Repetitive
☑️ Actually pretty amusing
🔲 The kind of fun you'll remember
🔲 Ride of your life

As a big fan of the series and of the RPG genre, I can say that I have enjoyed this game more and more as deeply as I got into the game. I really believe that Odyssey needs time on for players to fully value the work Ubisoft has put into and ignore the fact that it no longer aligns with the direction once Assassin's Creed became.

It keeps the old elements of Parkour and assassinations but doesn't expand on them, yet this game really does a great job with the beautiful world and lore behind it.

If you love Greek Mythology, you will find this game fascinating to explore and enjoy. I know I sure did.

🏞 Graphics:

🔲 MS Paint
🔲 Bad
🔲 Meh
🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game
🔲 Good (nothing special)
☑️ Beautiful
🔲 Masterpiece

The graphics of this game are gorgeous, and I needed to upgrade my PC's CPU to play it to its fullest details fully. The world is gorgeously crafted, and I can't give credit enough to Ubisoft for the beautiful work.

🔊 Sound:

🔲 Makes your ears bleed
🔲 Bad
☑️ Not special
🔲 Good
🔲 Beautiful
🔲 Masterpiece

I felt that as the new RPG era progressed, the whole world felt a bit bland and not so much alive. I can't say that I fully enjoyed the music and the ambient sounds of this world, but it's not bad either. Voice acting can sometimes feel off, but that's because this game contains hundreds of characters that needed voice acting, and I can understand that this may be why sometimes it feels like it could have spent more time in the oven.

📖 Story:

🔲 This game has no story
🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story
🔲 It's there for the people who want it
🔲 Well written
☑️ Epic story
🔲 Masterpiece

Without spoiling anything, I'd like to point out that this game takes time to grow on you regarding the story. It does a great job at creating emotions between you and characters along the way, and with the 3 DLC's you are bombarded with beautiful finishing touches of the great story.

I felt most intrigued playing the DLC's because they were topping down on areas of the game that left me craving to know more about Alexios's story, and I appreciate that.

I can tell you that despite the criticism regarding the direction the game takes you, on its own, you will enjoy it. The most enjoyable part of all the other Assassin's Creed's I've played is that your decisions actually matter.

🧵 Length:

🔲 Long enough for a cup of coffee
🔲 Short
🔲 Average
☑️ Long (if u can even finish it)
🔲 To infinity and beyond

According to Ubisoft Connect 188 hours, the game took me, but Steam recorded 283. It's a long game, and at some point, it felt like it was never-ending. I thought I could finish it a lot sooner, but the long journeys between objectives and if you're a completionist like myself, you'll spend about the same time.

I wish it would be shorter.

💷 Price:

🔲 Free
🔲 Underpriced
☑️ Perfect Price
☑️ Could be cheaper
🔲 Overpriced
🔲 Complete waste of money

Depending on the Edition you want to buy the game under, it can get pretty pricy. I recommend getting the Ultimate Edition through a Sale, as it's a bit too much. Do know that by spending less than £40, you will be spending a lot of time in the game. If you love the world and all, you'll feel that the price for the game is just perfect as you got a lot of content to explore.

🧩 Difficulty:

🔲 My 90-year-old grandma could play it
🔲 Easy
☑️ Normal
☑️ Hard
🔲 Dark Souls (if u play with bell demon and charmless it's extremely hard)

At times the game can spike in difficulty, especially with the issue of Level differences. You will find yourself struggling with enemies that are levels above you, but as you get better at the game and unlock skills and better gear, you can expect to dominate the battlefield even when facing foes 5-10 levels than you.

I don't want to brag, but I have managed to defeat an enemy ten levels above me, with a few trials and errors. So, if you're persistent, you can do it too.

⚖ Pros & Cons:

➕ Pros:
+ The World is Gorgeous and you'll have a lot to explore.
+ If you're a fan of Mythology or Greek Mythology, you'll love this game.
+ The story with the DLC's are nicely written, even though it focuses less on the ideology of Assassin's Creed.
+ You get to have a lot of items and gear to mix around and play.
+ Some romantic moments here and there, and you can enjoy them all.

➖ Cons:
- It's not what Assassin's Creed used to be, and this may be a turn off for some fans.
- Too long; I really wish it would be shorter.
- The world and the people may seem big, but sometimes I wish the cities felt more alive.
- Voice acting can be quite poor at times and can kick you out of the emersion.
- I wish the main story Cultists were a lot more similar to what the DLC (Legacy of the First Blade) did to give them a lot more reason behind being in the cult; only a few of them get that treatment.

⚙ Bugs:

🔲 Never heard of
☑️ Minor bugs
🔲 Can get annoying
🔲 ARK: Survival Evolved
🔲 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

I've encountered a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing that would bother me. I've got a couple of crashes in my entire playthrough. I would think about 5-6 in total. Not too serious. The game sometimes gets overwhelmed and simply crashes for me. That was more often when my CPU bottlenecked my GPU.

⭕Conclusion:
AC Odyssey is a beautiful assassin's creed game that focuses more and more on the lore of the Cultists (Templars) and their origins. While AC Origins focused on the beginning of the hidden ones, Odyssey focuses more on the begging of the Cult to create a reason behind it.

If you want to explore a gorgeous world filled with mystery, mythology and magic, you may enjoy Odyssey a lot more than you think.

Digital Deluxe Edition
Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)
DELUXE DIGITAL PACK:
- Kronos pack - contains the full Armour of Kronos armour set, the Hourglass mount, and the spear "Harvester of Time" - this pack gives more warrior damage boost
- Herald of Dusk pack - contains the full Herald of Dusk set of armour, and the Dusk Blood Offering sword - this pack is more stealth focused.
- Capricornus Naval Pack - contains the Capricornus boat and sailor skins - purely cosmetic.
- Temporary boosts to XP and money - boost lasts for 2 hours.


Gold Edition
Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)

SEASON PASS - Check the Content Info Above

So, the only difference between Gold and Ultimate Edition is that Ultimate has the Deluxe Edition Content. Unless you want to spend extra money to receive the deluxe pack for temporary xp boost and some armor and skins (the armour looks really cool and is useful after level 5 and not really useful after level 8 - upgrading it at the blacksmith takes too much resources and there is much better armor later on; up to you to buy Ultimate vs Gold Edition - price difference is not as big when on sale, though I bought Gold Edition) then I'd suggest you to get the Gold Edition.

Note:
You can not upgrade to Deluxe Edition later on, meaning if you buy the base game or the Gold Edition and decide you want the Deluxe Edition later - you will be rebuying the game again with the Deluxe/Ultimate Edition, and that's money wasted. Buying the base game with the intention to buy Season Pass or any of the other editions later on, is not worth it at all either - buy Ultimate Edition to have absolutely everything or buy the Gold Edition to have everything important gameplay-wise. You are saving money and getting the best of the game.

For Season Pass owners (which is in the Gold and Ultimate Editions) - Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered will not appear in your library as it is a part of, and available only through Assassin's Creed III Remastered. So, in order to play Liberation Remastered, you need to launch Assassin's Creed III Remastered. Both Remasters are slightly better graphically, than their previous versions.

You have to launch Assassin's Creed Odyssey once, before trying to launch the remastered content because Ubisoft Connect needs to load the content that comes with the Gold/Ultimate Edition. Otherwise, the Ubisoft client will ask you for a cd key activation, which is not possible anymore.

For any problems with the Ubisoft client: Verify Integrity of Game Files on Steam and if it doesn't work then uninstall the Ubisoft client and delete the current version and redownload the client from the Ubisoft site.

If you still have problems then God help you dealing with Ubisoft/Steam support. The latter has a faster response but both suffer from the same level of retardation.

Hopefully, the info will help you, so you don't have to look around various sites or contact the terrible support teams.

The end of an "Odyssey" (Last Patch + All DLC'S)
After a year of release and 300 hours, I would like to share my final opinion. (No Spoiler)

Pros:
1. An immersive, long and decent main story which takes about 30-50 hours.
2. A very big and detailed world with almost way too much to do and discover. If you want to do everything it will easily take about 100 hours or even more. So, better tell your friends and family that you don't have that much time for them and ask for some vacation.
3. A beautiful underwater world with sharks, a lot of fishes, manta rays and whales.
4. The sea combat from AC III, black flag and rogue is back.
5. The voice actors are amazing. I've played with Kassandra in german language.
6. The soundtrack is like always amazing. ( Especially the different version of Ezio's Family.)
7. A lot of features such as the photo mode, an eagle to discover, automatic walking,...
8. New free content. Mastery system, discovery tour, story creator mode and so on.

Neutral:
1. The graphics. Don't get me wrong it has very good graphics, but some textures don't look well. Trees and grass at a far distance looking garbage. Some animations looking weird and heartless! I think that I've enjoyed the origins graphics more - especially the sync point views.
2. It's great to have the choice to choose what's happening in the story. I do like it much more than just to have a linear story even if it is not that great like in other RPGs such as in the witcher. And that's the problem. Almost all choices do not have a long term impact at all.
3. They trying to do more with the abstergo story. It's ok, especially considered to everything after AC III, but sadly not as good as the desmond story which I really enjoyed.
4. It's great to choose the gender to play as a female or a male, but it does not affect the story or any stats like a male is stronger, but not as agile as a female.
5. The mercenary system is good. It reminds to some AC parts, the GTA wanted system and the shadow of war nemesis system. It's a nice idea, but I often felt interrupted at discovering.
6. The romances are ok but pointless. Mostly it's just a one night stand and nothing more.
7. You can weak a region and fight for Sparta or Athens, but it doesn't really matter.
8. The sidequests getting better, but it's mostly the same thing gameplaywise. Kill this person, steal something, talk to a person and so on.
9. The mastery system does fix a lot of balancing, but only after level 50.
10. After months a ng + mode, but without new skills or something like that. Lazy and late.

Contra:
The technique:
1. The PC port isn't that great. It does have an exemplary graphics menu. Every setting explains what it does, but sadly the game isn't that great optimized. Most settings barely boost your fps. I'm getting a stable 60 fps at almost max settings. I've tested it on different CPUs and my GTX 1070. This is definitely not that great especially considered that it does need 10-20% more performance than origins, although it doesn't look better. Everything else was fine for me. I didn't have any serious bugs, it didn't crash or freeze. The loading times on an SSD are fine.
Balancing problems:
2. The scaling is still forced. Leveling up is not that pointless anymore. You can invest the new points into the mastery system, but you still have to be at least 3 levels under your enemies.
3. The combat is good but does always feel like the same. Dodging is 95% the better choice than blocking attacks, which does make it pretty pointless.
4. At some parts of the main story, you have to do a lot of side quests to level up. It does throw you out of the story, which is really bad.
5. Teleporting is much worse than in origins. You can only port to sync points.
6. No shields. C'mon. Just why? Antic Greece and you can't even wear a shield?
Microtranslations:
7. I've ignored it the whole time and progressed pretty fast through the story. You can collect orichalcum to get some things from the store with luck, but of course, it's definitely nothing which belongs in a full price game!
Grinding:
8. The grind is real. For real. Lol. I personally do not have something against grinding, but it's way too much. You have to upgrade your gear like every 10-20min.
9. You have to collect way too many resources. Upgrading your gear is extremely overpriced and not even worth it cause you always get something better. (improved, but still expensive.)
10. I do miss the death secquences a lot. Killing "important" characters is pointless.
11. Lack of memorable or important npc's and actual Assassin's.

Tip to boost your performance:
If you switch the volumetric clouds from max to high it boosts your fps a lot by no visual difference. I'm getting about 7-10 fps more.
Tip to level up "fast":
Just accept every quest which you can get. A lot of side quests are similar. You can mostly do 2 or even more quests at the same time.

Conclusion:
Well, I do like every AC game. I do think that every part does have something special and their up and downs. It's also my favorite game franchise. That's also a big reason why I wanted to wait until I've finished the whole game before I do share my opinion. I had a lot of fun with this game.
Is it the same as origins? Which one is better?
It's almost the same, but much more to do, new and improved things, except things as graphics and performance. It's the better game gameplaywise, but not storywise.
Is it still an Assassin's Creed?
Yes and no. No hidden blade, no assassins, and no templars. So No. How could it even be? It's before the brotherhood has been created. BUT why yes? Well, "sadly" it's still an Assassin's Creed even if it is not the same feeling as for an example in the Ezio Trilogy, cause of the isu, the antic artifacts and present story.
Which version should you buy?
Well, I would only! buy it on sale now. I've bought the Gold Edition to play before release. Buy the season pass/gold edition if you can't get enough. The season pass includes the 2 DLC's and AC III and Liberation remastered.
How was the first DLC?
It was fun, but with 3h per episode to complete everything way too short. If I am honest and hard it's like almost every DLC these days it just feels like free content for money. So, you can skip it if you had enough of odyssey.
How was the the Atlantis DLC?
Well, I've heard that each episode takes about 10-12h, but I can't confirm that. It does add a new area and took me about 18 hours to complete everything. It has been great. More mythological stuff, but that's what I honestly expected for the main game...
What did they (not) change since release?
They've increased the level cap by 49, added automatic arrow crafting, a story creator mode, the discovery tour, weekly events, which are repetitive, easy and nothing special at all, a visual customization system, a mastery system, and many other things, which expand the game for free. The performance, (balancing) and other negative points are sadly the same.
What is your final opinion?
Well, I really do like the game. It's a good game, but the worst! Assassin's Creed. For me, it was the GOTY 2018 for PC!.


Questions? Feel free to write a comment or send me a message. There is definitely more to talk about, but sadly you can't write more in the review.

Thanks for reading and happy gaming!

- roughly 80+ hours for the full story
- balanced combat system, i.e. people of your level are a challenge in group, be under leveled and you'll get you ass handed to you, be over leveled and you'll be doing the ass kicking. (although the game does scale up as you level up)
- fun combat system with different skill trees and 3 ways of doing combat. Ranged, up close, or assassination. or even in combination with each other.
- Conquest mode is fun and rewarding the more difficult you make it for yourself.
- Mercenary system is good and not confusing or complicated, kill someone and move up in ranks. although if you are being hunter it does get ridiculous sometimes if you have 4 mercenaries hunting your ass at the same time. 
- Cult system is well done and takes some time to complete (you'll be doing that throughout the entire story and maybe even after)
- buttload of side quests for you to level up if you're stuck or struggling with something
- mythical creatures to slay, who doesn't love a good ass handing with a  or 

Hands down my favo AC game, I love these kind of games (open world / rpg) that have a lot of diversion and things to work on, doesn't get repetitive or boring, you can always switch to doing something else.

Would buy for the full price 100%. Totally worth the 60€

I'll keep it short and sweet.
This game is amazing. Utterly beautiful graphics and vistas which will make you stare. Immersive story line with all the side quests you can take.
Mercenaries you can hunt and kill, or who'll want to do the same to you.
Caves, all kinds of them with all kinds of things and stuff in them.
Sea battles with your glorious ship and fiery crew, in which your lieutenants are chosen by your hand in battle and now fight for your glory.
Epic battles. Sneaky murders. All out fights to the point you're more rage than wits. Clever assassinations.
Fight for the Spartans or Athenians, make them rulers of parts of the world and gain mighty gear and weapons.
There is much, much more. in fact, that epic story is for you to find out.
Honestly, I never thought I'd think much of it. Well, Odyssey has straightened me out.
if you are in doubt, just let your true spirit free and dive into ancient Greece and into...

77 hours in, I have reached level 42 and I'm not close to finishing the main story, not even half way. Too busy completing side quests and everything else in this huge and incredibly beautiful game. Every time I decide to go for a main quest something else comes in the way. And to be honest, I do procrastinate the main story because I don't want Kassandra's story to end. I'm pretty confident to say that Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the best game in the series followed by Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed 2.

I love Kassandra (Bayek and Ezio will always be my favorite assassins though), the story, the music and sound, the combat, the skills, the RPG elements, the world and how stunning and different every area is. Just as in Origins, the world feels so alive, if not a tiny bit more in this one. Take the time to listen to conversations around you and watch what people are doing, it can be pretty funny at times.

Of course it can be a bit repetetive sometimes with the grinding but I'm having so much fun doing it (so far). Odyssey is a really rewarding and satisfying game and does a fantastic job in keeping me motivated to do EVERYTHING. My mission is to 100 % Ancient Greece as I did with Egypt. :)

As for this moment, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a masterpiece.

Pros
+ Soo many things to do (side quests, exploration etc)
+ Greek landscape is stunning to look at
+ Vast array of well written side quests
+ Excellent voice acting/motion capture performances
+ Even minor characters are unique and have depth
+ Excellent DLC (Fate of Atlantis in particular)
+ Discovery tours for history lovers

Neutral
+/- Choices matter; doesn't fit the franchise IMO
+/- Talent specialization tree
+/- Tons of weapon types, but daggers are clearly the best

Cons
- Many "points of interest" are just copy and paste caves/camps
- Idiotic animal AI
- Ubisoft went full on RPG in this one (character+equipment stats)
- Level cap is too high at 99
- Gone are the days of sleek parkour introduced in Unity
- Warrior specialization is garbage


Truly an Odyssey
AC: Odyssey lives up to its name. This is by far the most immersive Assassin's Creed game yet. You truly feel like you're taken back to the days of Ancient Greece with the lively characters and stunning landscape. However, Odyssey's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness: Bloat. Far too many points of interest in the game are simply duplicated, and thus pointless to visit: Same camps, filled with the same enemies, with the same layouts, and same chests. While I visited every point of interest in Origins, I have to say I simply didn't bother with many of the locations in Odyssey. I wouldn't recommend visiting them either, unless mindless repetition is right up your alley...

But my biggest gripe of all however, has to be the annoying RPG system. I played the game on Hard with enemy level scaling. Because of that, gear has to be constantly upgraded in order to be relevant, and upgrades cost a LARGE amount of money and resources which require grinding. Raising the level cap to 99 was also a massive mistake on Ubisoft's part as well, because leveling basically made the game harder. I only really had full "end game" gear after close to 100 hours of gameplay.
On top of that, stats are extremely important. Not having 100% crit chance from your equipment basically takes away guaranteed assassination kills, which is an insult to a game in the ASSASSIN's Creed franchise. I can't say I enjoyed the direction Ubisoft chose here. Perhaps it would be best to simply call this game "Greek Mercenary: Odyssey".

Origins vs Odyssey?
I've played every installment in the franchise since 2007, and Origins is easily my favourite installment. Origins had just the right amount of content; the points of interest actually served a point, and the obscure locations gave you cool equipment. I also found Egypt to have the better looking landscape as compared to Greece. It also didn't have the obnoxious RPG stat system either. But perhaps I'm biased, seeing as the game that preceded Origins happens to be the worst installment in the franchise.
Now that said, if you couldn't afford to play both, I'd still recommend Odyssey solely based on bang for buck. You simply cannot go wrong with the sheer amount of content provided in this installment.

TL;DR
An excellent addition to the franchise, despite it being the greatest departure from the franchise. 9/10

BUY IT IF- 1) you like RPG's and want a vibrant world to dive in, 2) are an AC fan for your collection.
DON'T BUY IT IF- 1) You're looking for that original stealthy Assassin's Creed Experience.

WANT TO READ THE WHOLE SHEBANG ? Thank you for taking the time !

GAMEPLAY
The combat mechanics have been simplified from AC Origins, (Thank god that damn shield from Origins is gone ! :P, although some people did love the shield based combat i know). Free running is also pretty darn easy now, Kassandra/Alexios can pretty much climb any damn object no matter how jagged/smooth it is. The quests sometime get pretty boring and repetitive (Go someplace, kill some thugs, rescue XXX from bandits) and as you level up, killing bad guys becomes more and more routine and easy thanks to unlocked abilities. The Naval Combat system feels refreshed and its fun to ram ships around and roam freely. Overall, good improvements here

STORYLINE
Personally, i found the storyline to be a bit dull when compared to Origins, even though the protagonists are well designed and animated, they sometimes feel hollow (Maybe due to not such a great story?). There are some fun moments and interesting characters though ;).

GRAPHICS
Gone are the cutscenes with odd camera angles from Origins and say hello to fully cinematic cutscenes in all quests, Even if you're running it at medium-high settings, Odyssey is a treat to watch and the option to switch to travel speed when travelling via ship showcases the amazing lighting and water quality of the ocean from a spectacular angle, the character quality and facial animations have certainly improved. Overall a treat to watch and experience ancient Greece in a beautiful way. If you can run it at ultra, even better.

BOTTOM LINE
If you're a die-hard Assassin's Creed fan, you'll be somewhat disappointed as there are not much "Assassin's Creed-staple" features in the game. Instead of earlier AC games's emphasis on sneaking in, you can always barge in, sword and spear blazing but ultimately its up-to you what approach you take.
What this game does offer is a spectacular visual treat, quite a few amazing creatures/monsters to battle with as you level up and on the other hand several menial tasks like, fetching wine and helmets as well. A good balance you think? if you cant decide, read the starting para of this review again, it may help :P.

Yes sure it's not following the other AC series and it's not actually a Assassin's creed but it's a wonderful game; Here's why:
+ Wonderful Enviroment ( very colorful and stunning!)
+ Fun quests
+ Nice Story
+ Awesome Soundtracks (as expected)
+ Great gameplay ( you can say it's the enhanced version of AC Origins)
+ Great Sea fights
+ Awesome post release contents
_________________________________________
-Optimization could have been better
-Movement animations still needs more work
_________________________________________

It's like AC Black flag and AC Origins had a wonderful baby! Overall : 9/10

Probably my fav AC game since Black Flag.

Ever since the days of Ezio ended, it has been hard for me to get fully into an AC game, I never even bothered playing untiy, syndicate etc because I heard bad things.

The only two I have played since black flag is origins and odyssey, and I must say, to me, this one triumphs over Origins.

It might be personal opinion, as I much prefer Ancient Greece to Egypt, but I also just connect with the characters in this game more than Origins. There are a couple small details I miss, such as people trying to get you on their boat if they see you in the water (hasn't happened to me in Odyssey yet anyway) but so far, the game has been really strong.

Would recommend if you love the series but have been put off by recent titles.

I think with the time I have put into this game I have a perspective whether you agree with me or not. All of the reviews I have read are fair whether positive or negative regarding the game. Somewhere in between is the truth.

Odyssey like some pointed out doesn't feel like Assassin Creed even though the story line has a similar feel. For myself it is a mixture of Creed and Science Fiction with a bit of Witcher and Skyrim mixed in maybe more. It takes time to get a feel for the game and the different side quests and grinding to upgrade your character.

The good news is there are plenty of videos on YouTube to help you along your journey.

Myself, being somewhat anal have spent hours making spread sheets and breaking down various components of the game only because I enjoy analyzing what armor, weapons, engraves, and mastery skills give me an edge with my character. What I created and works for my play style is a Warrior, Assassin, Hunter Hybrid. To each their own.

Some gamer's are celebrating the sexual diversity while others are groaning. I feel strongly both ways. It is ancient Greece after all.

My conclusion: Immerse yourself in the game. Enjoy the scenery, characters, story and battles. Most importantly realize it is just a game, entertainment, time for you to get away from the distractions of the real world or is it the Matrix? Most of all have fun. Trust me life is to short to be petty.

I give Assassin's Creed® Odyssey: 8.6/10

Time to complete: 46 Hours

Minor Spoilers: I wasn't going to buy Assassin's Creed® Odyssey when it was first announced. It felt like a copy and waste of origins and didn't feel like an Assassin's Creed video game at all, however the Greek mythology persuaded me otherwise and after playing the game for a while, I know I made the right choice.

Personally, one of my favourite gaming franchises with an awesome game. Sure, it may not feel like Assassin's Creed, but for damn sure there is a lot of stuff to do in the game.

Pros

We venture into Ancient Greece, land of the gods. Odyssey strictly follows the Greek mythology to it's lore and says true to it which makes the game all more historically accurate. In a stunning and immersive word of Ancient Greece, we have several Greek cities with their own unique diversity. Odyssey felt like one of those games where it just simply blows your mind about how huge the maps are and how insanely detailed they are. The map size is very big, so big that you have to use a boat to travel across each part of the Greek islands.

We see many several historical figures shown in the game, such as the great King Leonidas of Sparta as well many other Greek mythological creatures, that you may also have to battle. And it's not just combat figures, there are also great people such as Pericles of Athens. These characters are developed to show how they were according to history which just improves the immersion. The character development for the main protagonists (Alexios or Kassandra) are done in the right way too. Every character that is relevant has their own personality and isn't bland.

Odyssey is a sandbox of RPG elements, and so done in the right way. Choices influence the story and can lead to different outcomes depending on what you pick. Levelling is done through quests and clearing out various landmarks on the map. You collect, improve and dismantle various gear to make your character a lot stronger. The diversity in gear and appearance is huge in this game. Each gear matches the play style of your choice. Abilities are unique and have their own strengths and weaknesses. You can kill leaders in real time which can start a war and change the occupying region. Stuff like this keeps the game very interesting.

The story itself felt didn't feel like an Assassins Creed story however, it doesn't mean I didn't like it. Odyssey is a very well made game with a unique story of its own. You venture into the life of the protagonist as they try to move on from the past whilst trying to destroy a certain organisation. My biggest factor for which I loved is that the side quests feel like a story of their own which can be really hard to do in a sandbox game. Odyssey doesn't fail to deliver that though.

The music within the game is very Greek folklore. There is also homage to Assassin Creed 2' theme song with it's own Odyssey twist which I thought was a great throwback.

Cons

Very few cons about this game which shows why it's a masterpiece of it's own. One issue I had with this game are the cut scenes. I get that the Devs are trying to make the game impact because of the choices that you make but sometimes some cut scenes feel so weird and some dialogue doesn't make sense for example, one second Alexios could be angry then the next hes smiling. I just wish there was also more Assassins creed references too because it is an Assassins Creed game after all.

Performance is always a huge factor in Assassin's Creed games. There could be some bugs that need to be fixed as well as some random NPC traits. I really hate it when you accidentally hit a Citizen, then a whole mob tries to take you down and you get a huge penalty for murdering civilians.

Combat sometimes felt clunky and no where near realistic. I wish the combat was realistic because the history around the game sticks true to its lore. It's hard to predict dodges and parry effects which throws you off guard and also lead to death depending on the difficulty that you are on.

I hope you enjoyed my quick review of Assassin's Creed® Odyssey. I highly recommend getting this game as Ubisoft did a great job improving the series with new elements and showing the great world of the Ancient Greeks. It doesn't always feel like an Assassin's Creed game but nonetheless, it has a great story of its own.

This game sets a great example for what is going wrong in the gaming industry at the moment: At its core it's an astonishing and amazing masterpiece that creates a beautiful pseudo-historic open world playground for exploration and questing. UbiSoft improved the gameplay experience on almost all levels in comparison to AC: Origins. Especially in regards to the quest design. The big but coming though is they also improved massively on their corporate greed. Every big update comes with changes to the ingame economy and lategame solely designed to push the player into their shop to obtain boosters via microtransactions. The only way around it forces you into a grind that makes even the fun parts of the game soon into a grinding chore. The max level cap was increased twice to enhance this grinding spiral even farther. For me as an oldschool gamer who remembers the times when boosting and customizing your character in epic single player titles was something that was up to you and for free due to cheats and eastereggs, these microtransactions were a concern from the getgo. But I did not say anything because I never felt the need for them myself and they were advertised as bonus services for impatient casual players and also a way to support the devs. But in this case here UbiSofts greed gets bigger with every patch: Increasing the level cap (twice already, almost doubling it from 50 -> 70 -> 99) and lowering resource gain from ingame mechanics with every update is just to be explained with them trying to force you either into a needless, unnecessary grind that is frustrating or into spending money on their helix credits and ingame boosters. This, considering we are talking about a full prized singleplayer game is just infuriating and outrageous. Basically they keep ruining a gameplay experience for the player that was truly fun and exilarating in the first place and hide it behind a paywall if you want the game back that you knew. I am deeply offended by this update policy of theirs and henceforth can't recommend the game anymore even though I loved it in the start.

Update regarding Patch 1.2.0 and The Legacy Of The First Blade DLC
The latest DLC "Legacy Of The First Blade" adds one quest-line to the most empty region of the game. While from what I've come to know about it so far, the quest seems to be really cool and adds more of the Assassin's Creed vibe to the game, it's definetely very pricy for the new content it adds to the game. In my oppinion it's very odd, that it's set in the most neglected region of the main game and leaves the feeling of old DLC policies of cutting things from the game to release them later on for some extra cash.
The newest patch 1.2.0 did not distort the ingame economy any further and is officially mostly about bugfixes. The patch introduced a new addendum to the gameplay as well: You can purchase gear slots for ingame currency now. These new slots allow you to assign predefined sets of gear (only gear not skills) to interchange between them more quickly. A feature I personally deem utterly useless since the changing of gear at least for sets was quickly done anyways.
Since its addition I have encountered that the mercenaries seem to have gotten stronger by a big margin. Even lower tier mercenaries one- or two shot my fully max geared character now, while they are somewhat of "bulletsponges". One mercenary gave me a bigger challenge than the mythical bossmonsters. It might require changed gear to be able to fight them. Since the upgrades for gear are still hidden behind ridiculous upgrade costs and henceforth stupid amounts of grind, I was not able to test other gear.

Update:
Recently it was brought to my attention that nowadays 100% Achievement completion is only obtainable, if all DLC's are purchased.
Another big negative in my oppinion, especially since the second DLC "Fate of Atlantis2 fully embraces a wonky-ass turn into a mythical Isu Questline.To be honest here, it might just be me being fed up with that kind direction, but I have also heard some critique from AC lore enthusiasts, that it creates some inconsistencies.

What do you get when you add the standard Ubisoft chores to one of the best open worlds ever created? Not a bad game, apparently.
Most Ubisoft open world games are just a bunch of recycled ideas from a previous game put in a new skin and this one is no exception. The side-quests in the game (those other than the automatically generated fetch quests) are often underwhelming with mediocre writing and uninteresting tasks. However, a few character quest lines such as those of Socrates are an exception. These are surprisingly well written and thought provoking. The main storyline has its highs and lows but is interesting and well written overall. There is a decent mercenary system and a morally questionable conquest battle system, where you have to weaken a nation by burning its supplies and participate in the war that ensues, all just to get gear.
The combat in the game is a mixed bag. I don't like the reliance on adrenaline in combat. Halfway through the game, you'll stop caring about attacking and just spam abilities off cooldown, especially since there's an ability that refills adrenaline. As for stealth, the AI is not that smart. Detection doesn't use sound and is only based on vision. Crouching in a bush makes you invisible to even people that are really close to you. I also don't like the fact that stealth attacks aren't instakills and a guard might survive a stab in the neck just because he was 2 levels ahead of you. The naval combat is great.
What really makes the game interesting is the open world. Ancient Greece is a great location for an open world game and Ubisoft has nailed it. Greek architecture reinforced by bright marble, mountains enveloped in fog at dusk, sunlit valleys full of grass and islands on the horizon shrouded by sea all come together to make a beautiful world. Everytime I dock my ship on a new island I would find myself eager to run in and explore. I only wish that the game didn't actively discourage exploration as it does. Every point of interest is marked with a question-mark on the map which cannot be turned off. Moreover, when you reach such a place, instead of letting you explore, the UI gives you a list of things allows your eagle to mark things in these list. This guarantees that you're not missing anything by not exploring. Thankfully, these can be turned off along-with a handful of other HUD elements, that take away from the experience. The main quests objectives are spread out in the world and there is a level scaling system. This means that once you get past the initial stages of the game, you are free to choose where to go.
Assassin's Creed Odyssey is far from perfect, but it is still very much an enjoyable game.

TL;DR - Worth purchasing if on sale. IMO, $40 - or less - is worth forking over for AC: Odyssey.

Pros:
+ Good, fluid combat (improved over AC: Origins combat).
+ Overall fun game play
+ Some genuinely funny moments, scenes and dialogues.
+ New abilities and combat functions.
+ Vast map - lots to explore and interesting terrain/sea.
+ Interesting Mythology and it's related quests.
+ Enjoyable naval combat. Can upgrade ship, crew, crew weaponry, sails, etc. Can sink ships for loot or board enemy ships to fight hand-to-hand.
+ Ability to request an NPC for a temporary battle buddy.
+ Ability to tame animals as pets and fighters.
+ Side quests galore! Also Daily Quests.
+ Inventory system and gear is (mostly) pain-free and intuitive. Lots and lots of gear!
+ Can customize the appearance of your armor/gear. The cosmetics and skill perks of armor and weapons are interchangeable. No need to wear an ugly helmet or chest armor simply b/c it has the best armor rating - swap out the cosmetic for something you like, but keep the armor rating and perks!
+ A "Cult" to investigate and destroy.
+ Mercenaries to kill (or recruit to your ship) and a mercenary tree that provides various benefits by climbing up the metaphorical ladder.
+ Territory control - influence whether Spartans or Athenians dominate the map. Conquest battles involve battles with lots of friendly and enemy AI; decide which nation to help or slay.
+ more that I'm forgetting.

Cons:
- Dialogues, conversations and NPC reactions are horrible (I'll give more details below)
- Clunky parkour and climbing – very frustrating during stealth and combat. Was much more refined in AC:Origins.
- Removed hiding in carts/barrels (AC:Origins). They should have kept this feature since hiding now consists of bushes, on top of roofs, or behind objects/walls.

Neutral
+- Graphics are noticeably reduced when compared to AC:Origins, likely to increase performance as this game is more resource demanding. Nonetheless, still a beautiful game.
+- I'm not a fan of underwater environments or the related quests, but some may like it.
+- Can fight Mythological beings in side quests. I prefer a good dose of realism. Some may really like it though.

The story and plot are good, but poorly implemented. It's disjointed at times even when following the natural course of the story. It's akin to telling a good joke but screwing up the punchline.

What really hurts the story are the character dialogues and subsequent reactions within conversations. Some dialogues are just nonsensical. Some choices are neither good nor bad, just equally stupid. Characters morph from pure elation to outrage and back to elation within the same short conversation. It's either poor writing (and quality control) or everyone suffers bipolar disorder. I typically don't nitpick over these issues, but it's pretty bad in AC Odyssey. Very immersion breaking; to the point I no longer care about what needs to be done or why, I just want to complete the mission and move to the next.

Regardless of the gripes, I enjoy the game and recommend purchasing if on sale. For the hardcore fan, you'll love it.

This one sits next to its transcendent predecessors, such as Assassin's Creed II and Black Flag - two titans that lived up to their hype.
Ubisoft intertwined all the good elements from the previous titles, while injecting some new ones, and the results are stellar. Naval warfare is now far more enjoyable with the new implementations; pirating has never been more fun. The combat system still feels a bit sluggish, lacking variety, but good on its own merits. Stealth seems oddly satisfying, though.

Now, as far as graphic design goes, this game is a work of art. Takes on a massive, stunning open world filled with tons of content and mesmerising landscapes to feast your eyes on. Even without a story line, you would still find yourself wandering for hours, exploring the splendour of ancient Greece and its uniquity. It takes a lot to impress me these days, but this game managed to win my heart in that regard.

Story-wise, while the narrative itself does not really stand out, it still makes me crack a smile every now and then, since the whole game is splattered with bits of well-articulated humour, springing out when you least expect it. It does not exactly feel like the traditional Assassin's Creed game one would expect, featuring elements from The Witcher franchise, but that's what makes it so spectacular and outstanding.

Bringing it all together, a title truly worthy of its name, that will take you on a roller coaster of hours and hours of bloody adventures you won't forget anytime soon (if you can handle the grind, which is abysmally long).

I do absolutely recommend this game in every way possible and you malákas should buy it. It's a journey you don't wanna miss.

And remember, ''Youth is a state of mind!''

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is a part of this new trilogy of AC games that focus more so on gameplay and time era than its roots. Being more focused on weapons, fighting, abilities, world, and characters more so than stealth, hidden blades, and hoods like were used to. Although Origins is very similar to this Odyssey takes it to a whole another level removing the hidden blade, almost every sense of stealth, and you don’t even play as an Assassin, etc. Really huge world and lots of copy and paste side objectives to fill your time with exploring along with several cool bosses. The present day storyline is boring and pointless at this point and the game reuses a majority of assets from Origins including game mechanics making it very similar.

+Massive open world with several islands, open water, and all kinds of different sub regions to explore with their own quests and characters and even bosses.
+Naval combat means you get to control your own ship and battle other ships for resources to upgrade your ship or just for fun. Can recruit lieutenants as you go to give you more benefits.
+Lots of side objectives and side quests scattered all throughout the world
+Several cool boss fights with cyclopses, Medusa, the minotaur, etc.
+Eagle that you can use to scout out resources or enemies from a distance
+Variety of weapons to choose
+Skills and various abilities
+A lot of different armor types you can wear and even have a vanity slot to wear whatever you want and still have the highest armor value
+A lot of timed quests for quick recourses
+Can upgrade weapons from blacksmiths
+Constantly being hunted by bounty hunters the more you commit crimes the more come after you makes the game more intense and entertaining however, you can always pay them off to leave you alone
+Through progressing the story or just doing side related content you can find clues to who the Templars are and hunt them down
+Battle arena to just fight endless waves of enemies or key characters
+2 different characters to play as
+Can sparta kick most enemies off of high ledges to do insanely high damage
+Can chose which side of the Peloponnesian war to side with in every area of the game either with Athens or Sparta
+Athens is such an amazing city to explore and run around
+Dialogue choices and you can make major decisions in the story that impact the ending
+Can climb almost any surface
+No fall damage perk
+Can have your horse go directly towards any marker without moving them yourself
+Whales constantly jump out of the water when sailing and is super awesome
+Can skip through dialogue omfg thank god for this

-Orchilaum felt useless the items you can buy with it never felt worth how rare it is
-Honestly the map felt to big and trying to 100% the map you’ll just experience the exact same activities again and again with the exact same layouts
-Although the bounty hunters are fun they can also be very annoying as several locations and quests require you to break the law therefore causing bounty hunters to pursue you and if anything also then makes you have to pay them off. Every bounty hunter you kill they just get replaced with another they are endless. If you are assaulting a fort or any kind of base with enemies and get detected the bounty hunters no matter where on the map could be 1,000 kms away they will teleport to the base and attack you. Sometimes even 3 or more at time which is just so overhwhelming and stupid. Not only that but even battling a single bounty hunter and the others will teleport to you to assist.
-Several enemies are just immune to being kicked off ledges :(
-Several conquest battles that take place in naval combat has the enemies leave the battle area and pursuing them will cause you to lose for leaving the combat area
-Not really an Assassin’s Creed it all… no hidden blade, almost no stealth aspect it all aside from hiding in bushes that's literally it. The main character you play as isn’t even an Assassin nor is there even a mention of the Assassins in the main story aside from the present timeline as well as the Templars aren't named either. Barley any parkour aside from climbing mountains occasionally clearly Ubisoft just wants to focus on making RPGs in certain time periods than making an actual AC game as calling it AC will sell more than a new ip.
-Athens needs more fast travel areas around it I hate running through the city to get to a marker 400 meters away
-Can romance several characters but no sex scenes :(
-Odyssey reuses a bunch of assets and game mechanics from Origins almost by making it the exact same game except with a new map, characters, and some new game mechanics. Aside from that it felt like Origins so much with how similar the gameplay was
-Characters voice acting, movements in cutscenes, and overall narrative is boring at times and just awkward
-The bull charge ability typically just goes right through enemies and does no damage or always misses
-You have to use another program Uplay or Ubisoft Connect to play this which is so lame it takes forever to load and then cloud saves upon quitting which lags everything. If I leave my computer on after playing I’ll keep getting emailed for an activation key for being afk too long? ♥♥♥♥ Uplay
-Smaller boats break for literally no reason at random times
-Can’t stealth any base unless you get lucky enough with a high assassination skill. Majority of captains you have to kill will survive you assassinating them then causing you having to fight them and alerting the rest of the base. Stealth is so rare…

Odyssey is a fun game for someone with a lot of time, likes a huge open world game with tons of different weapons and abilities to obtain, and likes Greek Mythology. However in comparison to being an actual Assassin’s Creed game it is almost nothing like one. You don’t play as an Assassin, you have no hidden blade, almost no stealth options at all, and basically no parkour. It’s just an open world Spartan RPG branded as an AC game in order to actually sell well compared to if it was its own new game. Very similar to Origins and Valhalla in this RPG like games not like every other game in the series. The game is fun if you like doing the same activities scattered around the insanely huge map again and again whilst having the weird dialogue cutscenes in a non Assassin's Creed Assassin’s Creed game. It’s ok. They literally tried so hard to fit Assassin’s into the story…. Of an AC game.

Assassin's Creed: Odyssey is definitely a good game. However, it pales in comparison to Origins in terms of character development and the atmosphere of its setting.

Pros:
+ Beautiful graphics helped to recreate a vivid and colourful Ancient Greece.
+ Fun and satisfying combat and stealth system, making you feel powerful.
+ Item customization is extensive which allows you to create insane engrave combos for your weapons and gears.
+ You can vault over lower objects. (YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN ORIGINS!!)

Cons:
- Does not feel like an Assassin's Creed game at all, many aspects of the game's story even broke canon lore of the franchise 
- The setting is much less detailed than in Origins. By details, I do not mean graphical fidelity. I mean, however, the way the environment is set up to guide your thinking and detecting processes (for example, in Origins, embalmers are always found at a temple with Anubis statues in front of it even if you turn off the Quest marker.)
- The multiple choices in the game are actually inconsequential and they even hurt the game's character development since Kassandra/Alexios is a non-character who has no fixed personality. Meanwhile, Bayek, given more games, could have rivaled Ezio.

Even though I do not enjoy Odyssey as much as Origins, I would not do the game dirty by not recommending it. People who love the setting and a good time can still enjoy the game extensively. I myself have played more than a hundred hours of it, anyway.

“Glory and death, Spartans will never surrender! 🎶”
~Sabaton

The Assassin's Creed... Personally, I have serious love / hate relationship with this series. Right after the very first game was released in 2007, I instantly fell in love with Animus concept, Dan Brown-like story, character design and gameplay mechanics that felt a lot like a stealth take on Prince of Persia. Sure, the first game was more like a proof of concept, but when the second one started Ezio's saga? It felt awesome. Assassin's Creed II pretty much turned me into a fan, really. Unfortunately, there's that thing about Ubisoft that ruins everything. The thing is – they're greedy as f. And after Mr. Auditore turned the series into a huge hit, they started milking it like there's no tomorrow. Sure, the new games had some mind-blowing ideas that were way ahead of their time and there was always something new, but at the same time, the core mechanics were always the same, while open world elements... well...

Unlike many others, I never liked Black Flag. Even though the main character there was voiced by Matt Ryan (AKA the one and only true John Constantine), I always felt like the game was a perfect example of what was wrong with the series at that point. Sure, it did naval battles (that were introduced in AC III) justice, but at the same time, it felt like a royal waste of time. There were millions of things to do, but at the same time, pretty much all of them were for nothing. And when it was about the main game, it was nothing but the same exact missions we've seen ages ago. Naturally, with such an approach, the reboot was inevitable. Especially since the main story ended in AC III and since then it was, like, a bunch of fillers.

So, when Assassin's Creed Origins arrived, I was really curious. I mean, it was that exact point for the series, where it was time for Ubisoft to introduce some really big changes. To finally make a next big step. And we all know how it ended the previous time they tried something like that in Splinter Cell. Surprisingly, Assassin's Creed Origins turned out... pretty solid, really. Not perfect (far from it), but still, it was surprisingly neat soft reboot. If we can call it like that, since well, it was pretty much a different game. Sure, it looked like Assassin's Creed and all of its signature features and moves were still there, but instead of our usual action / stealth, we've got ourselves something that felt a lot like an action role-playing game.

That's right, role-playing game. We've got a huge open world environment, we've got choices, we've got leveling and we've got grinding. Tons of grinding... Which was my biggest complaint about Origins. Sure, there was more meaning in what we were doing than what Black Flag had to offer, but since the game was really, really slow (about 3x times slower than I can possibly take), grinding for better gear was just... boring. And you did need a better gear because Assassin's Creed Origins was one of those games, in which enemies leveled together with you. You know how it is, even if you leveled up to the maximum level, the enemies did exactly that too and the only way to get some real advantage in battle was to get better gear. Which, like I said, was boring. Also, yes, open battles became the main dish in the Assassin's Creed Origins. Sure, the stealth was still there, but the game didn't force you to use it anymore. Exactly the opposite, again and again Origins forced you to fight openly. In other words, it felt very different from what we had before, but at the same time, it was far from being a failure. Especially since the ancient Egypt looked absolutely stunning.

Naturally, I was somewhat excited about Odyssey. Sure, after Origins I didn't feel like playing another one for, like, a year (just because it was way too slow), but at the same time... See, I grew up with The Histories of Herodotus. Back when I was a kid, most of the fantasy novels were either prohibited in my country, or impossible to find. But we had all sorts of ancient myths and history-related stuff. So... that's what I've read as a kid. Naturally, there's a very special place in my head for ancient Greece. And even though Assassin's Creed Origins felt more like an interactive tour than a proper game, I totally didn't mind something like that in ancient Greek setting. Guess what? That's exactly what I've got.

I mean, you know how it is about Ubisoft. Let's just admit it, nobody expected them to make a next big step right away, right? Odyssey follows the same exact formula we had in the old AC series. Which means that it's exactly the same thing, just in different setting and with some new features. Which... are not really that cool. The biggest new feature this time (aside from gender selection) is conquest battles. Long story short, you do some grinding (yeah, yeah, everything in this game requires a lot of boring grinding) and then you participate in the battle for certain territory. You help one of the sides win and conquer the area, and... you can repeat the process again. Just because. While some of the conquests being story-related, there isn't much meaning in it. Aside from rewards, of course. Because... you know. Grinding. In Assassin's Creed Odyssey you literally do grinding just to get access to more grinding. Good golly, y'all...

I don't want to say that it's a terrible game, but... just keep in mind that it's far from what we've seen in good ol' Assassin's Creed II, in which everything had meaning and you wanted to get every single collectible. Odyssey is exactly like Origins. It's slow, kinda boring, painfully repetitive and is sinking in tons of grinding. It's more like an ancient Greece tour than a game, really. Then again, you will want to look around. Because this... game... looks... great. Playing this game feels like the books from my youth coming to life. Unfortunately, this game is also a technical disaster. First of all – it's pretty CPU demanding (even more than the next installment in the series, since, unlike Valhalla, this one doesn't use the advanced DirectX 12 API). Up to the point where it can overheat your processor if your model is hot and your cooling is just enough. And if your gaming rig is cold, this game will crash it just because. Because that's what it does. It hates you and personally, I didn't have a single session without technical difficulties. There's always something. And if you think that playing on consoles will save you from all that bull? Well, think again. For example, this game can stop saving your progress. Or even lose it completely. Just because. Imagine wasting dozens of hours on grinding and then realizing that your entire progress was lost. Sounds fun, huh? Well, that's what this game does. A lot. Make sure to use manual saves. And then backing those up, because even manual saves have tendency to disappear. You have been warned.

So... yeah. Here we are. Before paying for this game, make sure it's exactly what you want. Odyssey is a huge game with many hours of gameplay and many things to do, but at the same time it feels more like an interactive tour. Pretty slow one too. It's one of those games you play because they look good. You just enjoy the visuals, enjoy the atmosphere and then rage quit because Ubisoft's coders suck butt. Naturally, I can't say I recommend this game to everybody, but still, there's sure something beautiful here. Slow. Buggy. Repetitive. With tons of grinding and microtransactions (yes, really). But still, pretty beautiful. Just make sure it's exactly what you want right now and be ready for technical issues. Dixi.

There is only one word to describe Assassin's Creed Odyssey and if you're reading this 4 years after release you probably already know it. It's BIG.

(TLDR; if you like Assassin's Creed and big, open world games, this game is worth your time and money when it's next on sale).

AC:O is ridiculously big, impressively so at first but rather depressingly so 120ish hours in. At it's core I found the moment to moment gameplay really quite enjoyable, combat is fun with a decent variety of weapons plus I liked the power creep of slowly improving your gear and skills. I played as Kassandra which I don't regret for a second as her performance went a long way in keeping me engaged through the many lines of dialogue and she definitely earns her place is Assassins Creed history.

The story starts off rather captivating, it's intriguing and full of some surprising reveals. I found it started to fall flat around the halfway mark and struggled to keep up the momentum at the end, perhaps because there seem to be a number of ending defining choices throughout and mine must have been less than optimal, as I felt incredible short-changed at the end of my journey. There are a few ensemble characters who never faltered though, and I enjoyed their company throughout.

The world of ancient Greece is beautifully crafted and massive, there are hundreds of points of interest ranging from ancient temples to grand occupied forts and while you will see the same sort of environments pretty quickly, the enemy/treasure placement always felt different enough that I could tackle each place in a fresh way.

I believe your level of enjoyment from AC:O will directly correlate to how you play open world games. I made it my mission to discover every '?' on the map, assassinate every target and experience every piece of content available. And for a long time this was incredibly therapeutic. I could play for hours without progressing my Odyssey and just explore, ticking off that omnipresent open-world checklist and feeling like I was getting stuff done. I wasn't really, it's all rather fruitless but as the old saying goes, "the time you enjoy wasting, is not wasted time".

Once the burnout kicked in, it kicked in hard. I began to notice the needless, drawn out dialogue, the painfully slow paced side quests and stretches of land that really had no place being there. I gave up stealth and rushed in to every encounter, just trying to kill as quickly as I could and made a habit of skipping some dialogue in cutscenes just so I could get to the next objective.

It's strange, because if I had decided to make this a more focused experience and concentrated on the main story I wouldn't have come close to feeling fatigued. However, it doesn't feel right to ignore the open-world aspect of an open-world game, for better or for worse.

To conclude, I had a lot of fun with AC:O and if you like to compare hours played to money paid then objectively it is more than worth it. On a more subjective level though, the game is astonishingly big and it is a wonderful world to get lost in, there is no wrong way to play this game but if you're stubborn like me, you might be sick of the sight of it towards the end.

Undoubtedly, AC: Odyssey as a game has quite a few issues: bad AI, the strangulation of the player with hundreds of missions and missed opportunities on the RPG level. But it does something also very important: it includes a huge and impressive world, capturing successfully the Ancient Greece aesthetic and it manages to be truly entertaining and unimaginably addictive.

9/10.

Editing my Review since people have asked about my specs and game settings, that portion is at the bottom* Second edit regarding the DLCs.

Where to begin.

Well I was never really a die hard Assassin's Creed fan by any means. I enjoyed the games up until Brotherhood where I stopped, then picked up again at Black Flag because pirates. A friend of mine gifted this to me a month or so ago and I tried to hold off playing as I have a somewhat dated graphics card and while fiddling with settings it ran pretty badly.

I finally broke down and decided to get serious with this after a number of my friends posted screenshots and told their stories about this game, and it was something I couldn't wait to play any longer. After a lot of tinkering and adjusting I found the perfect, or almost perfect settings for graphics vs performance. Once I started, I was immediately sucked in. For some quick backstory on me, I've always been fascinated by the Greco-Roman periods, and I've always wanted an open world game set in either of those periods. Seeing as Odyssey is set during the Peloponnesian War it was something that hooked me immediately.

It's a bit jarring at first, playing in an environment where combat revolved around the Hoplite and his shield. I understand Ubisoft's decision around removing them from player controlled combat mechanics, so as to make combat faster and more reaction based; but I would at least have liked the option to use a shield. With that poor decision (in my opinion) overlooked, Odyssey doesn't play like a traditional Assassin's Creed game. For one, it doesn't focus on Assassin's, and instead focuses on the First Civilization story. This to me is a nice change of pace as for the last game I played, Black Flag, I felt out of place as an Assassin pirate. This game plays more like The Witcher 3 mixed with Lord of the Rings Shadow of Mordor/War, and it's perfect in my opinion.

Set during the Peloponnesian War, your role is that of a Misthios, or Mercenary, as you fight and journey through your own Odyssey in discovering, and confronting your past. Your decisions, major and minor, affect numerous quests and outcomes with this game. Even seemingly minor things can have impacts hours upon hours later as you sail and discover more of the Greek world. Speaking of sailing, combat and ship handling is pretty much an exact copy of Black Flag, which I was more than happy with. Instead of cannons obviously, your ship is equipped with javelins and arrows. The customization isn't as in depth as far as I recall with Black Flag, but you can upgrade various parts of your ships, as well as cosmetic appearances like your Crew and ship Hull, along with the bow figure. The vast majority of these cosmetic items can be found throughout the game in underwater wrecks, or you can purchase exclusive items from the Ubisoft Store.

Speaking of the Store. Most items are randomly put on a "sale" of sorts by visiting a special vendor in game. Finding Orichalcum ore in game is your currency for this special vendor. You can purchase a random item, or you can purchase one of four special items from the vendor for that week, which includes a special Ubisfot Store item, from a special weapon, horse skin, ship skin, or ship bow figure. Personally, I would advise saving up as much as you can and waiting for that special Store item you'd like to purchase with Orichalcum ore. You can earn Orichalcum ore through finding the mineral in the game world, or completing certain Bounties which net you 10 pieces depending on the Quest. You can of course buy a map in the store which shows you the location of every orichalcum in the game world (cheeky Ubisoft).

The game world, is insanely massive. With each region starting at a recommended level before you can effectively fight in it. Once you surpass a region recommended level, let's say 15 to 20, the region level matches your current level, lets say 30. The enemies and quests scale with you, while some may be a level or two under you as you level up, you'll also find some special enemies at or above your level, offering a nice challenge for this massive game going forward. Ubisoft recently dropped a patch that raised the level cap from 50 to 70, with the addition of a New Game + mode coming Soon(TM). As for me, while I have not reached the level limit, I've completed the game and a with all achievements at about or over 220 hours of gameplay. This is with me trying not to fast travel much and taking my horse or ship wherever I can, to admire and absorb the absolute beauty of this game for what it is. It's mesmerizing how full of life and beauty it is. From the mountains to the forests, to the densely packed cities, there's just so much that this game offers to enjoy should you want to.

I'll finally add, I'm not really a fan of Season Passes, however, out of all the games I've played, this will probably be the first in which I do indeed by a Season Pass, as this game has more than met my expectations for what an open world RPG should be like. Overall, this game, because of its setting, has replaced The Witcher 3 in the number 2 slot in my all time favorite games. And should Ubisoft put out meaningful content and support for this game, I daresay it might even become my all time favorite game I've ever played. Ubisoft has always been hit or miss with games. Some of them decent, some of them terrible; but once in a while, they come out with a perfect gem of what gaming should be and Assassin's Creed Odyssey more than meets the perfect gem criteria.

1987/2048 MB of VRAM used. FPS hovers around an average and stable (for me) 35-40 FPS. Max FPS I've gotten is 60+. Sometimes it jumps down into the 15+ FPS, at which point I'll just save and restart my game.

Of note, I've found that Volumetric Clouds and Fog really tank FPS so that's why I've set them to Low. I should be getting a graphics card upgrade in the next month or so, then I'll post any differences I've found with graphics vs performance.

Fate of Atlantis Episode 3 follows The Eagle Bearer on their final journey for this DLC. Where the environment retains its stellar quality from the previous two journeys, all taking place within Atlantis itself. However, the positives end there. Overall it felt significantly shorter than the previous two Episodes, with the various Quests and the plotline itself feeling very lackluster. On top of this, aside from some new weapons and a new outfit, all other items are re-used assets from the game, which is extremely disappointing.

My main gripe with all of the DLC; is that you spend the base game on your Odyssey, interacting with a myriad of characters where your choices actually have consequences. The DLC 1 and 2, on the contrary, don't have any such consequences for your choices. From a story and gameplay perspective, DLC's 1 and 2 are a complete letdown. It also doesn't end well on the last Episode of Fate of Atlantis.

I genuinely had no expectations with Odyssey. Assassins Creed died along with Desmond for me. However, I was truly blown away with positivity for this installment of the series. Odyssey reminds me and takes a page from the Witcher 3. It's incredibly enjoyable and in my opinion more superior and engaging than Origins. That said, I couldn't get into Origins it wasn't for me.

I've been a Assassins Creed fan ever since the first game. Over the years the game has evolved, adapted, and improved on every aspect up to Black Flag. I didn't feel the need to play the future installments after Black Flag. In my opinion they didn't fit in the mold of the series and I didn't support the actions Ubisoft were taking with the title. Odyssey changed my perspective on that with its fresh ideas and made me believe that a different direction isn't a bad one.

I still miss my boy Ezio :(

My action Review for this game has been Hijacked by the Cash Shop.

"Time Savers" and any other items meant to be sold to the players who've already bought your game is a disgrace.

We paid you, Ubisoft. You do not get to then peddle us with a Cash Shop. You get a negative review for this horrible behavior.

I like the game! I like the graphics, the story and the general design.

BUT! EVERYONE HAS TO STOP BUYING THE MICROTRANSACTION CRAP THAT SEEMS TO BE THE UBISOFT TRADEMARK THESE DAYS! If you stop buying it, they will stop doing it!

Ubisoft has acctually put in grind walls in the game, and then put in "time-savers" that are expensive as ♥♥♥♥! Its disgusting behaviour from the developers. I will, because of this, give the game a negative review as a protest against this.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey
A journey longer than that of Odysseus

📋 Premise

It's been a little less than a year since Assassin's Creed Origins was released and we already have a brand new game in our hands. After Origins revolutionized the way we approach the franchise's games, Ubisoft is surfing the success wave with their brand new Assassin's Creed Odyssey, adding fire to their open-world series. From an all too flat desert scenery, we move on to a flourishing, stunning and vibrant world.
Greece welcomes you with sun-drenched, lushy breathtaking lands and seas. Just one warning before you go: beware of the snakes in the grass.

✅ Pros:

• An immersive story with an excellent narrative and dozens of plot twist to keep you on edge
• Extensive world with countless locations to explore and regions to conquer
• A protagonist can be either female or male
• The choices you make will have a longlasting impact on the world that surrounds you and in the quests you undertake
• Sailing returns in all its splendor and it feels better than ever
• Enjoyable companions and side characters
• A very clean user interface as well as neatly organized menus

❎ Cons:

• The hyped "romance system" is nothing more than a series of one night stands: the options feel forced and add nothing to the story
• Weird facial expressions
• Dialogue choices can feel inconsistent

🎮 Gameplay: in depth

General information
Assassin's Creed Odyssey follows Origins in its footsteps, retracing its template and borrowing from the best open-world designs to craft an enrapturing experience. Every region and island in Greece has been recreated on a grand scale with a startling attention to details. The new exploration feature, Explorer Mode, minimizes the game's suggestions by removing waypoints and replacing them with three clues, leaving more room for the players to find out where to go.

It's the very first Assassin's Creed installment in which we are asked whether we want to play as a male or female character: Alexios or Kassandra. No matter our choice here, the follow up will remain the same and the brothers will merely be exchanging places in the narration.

Speaking of choices, we can now pick from multiple answers during dialogues: asking for further information, accepting or declining a job, or very binary choices of good and evil in which we must decide whereas to kill an enemy or to show mercy. All this will eventually shape our character towards one of the many endings that Odyssey has to offer. However, the system might feel underwhelming at times.

Odyssey also makes a first attempt in engaging in romantic relationships, regardless of your gender. However, it fails terribly to deliver a proper experience and gives more room to a light-hearted series of one night stands. If the romantic aspect is awkward enough when it's offered as a reward, it's even more so when it's presented to us through dialogue choices, often breaking the seriousness of the moment and the flow of the conversation itself.

We can roam the regions cleaning enemy outposts, weakening the two factions or involving ourselves in large-scale battles to conquer regions for Sparta or Athens - we're mercenaries, after all. It's thanks to these last two features that the experience Odyssey offers is way more substantial.

Story
For my first playthrough, I decided to take on the role of Kassandra: although the narrative stays the same no matter whom we play as Kassandra seems to be the most charismatic and charming of the two siblings.

We begin our story in Kephallonia, in the Korinthian Gulf, as a Spartan outcast that has been raised on the island ever since we were but a kid. The past hasn't forgotten about our character, and it will suddenly come hunting us, forcing us to leave the safe shores of Kephallonia to embark on a journey, unsuspecting of the web of lies that we will be uncovering. The story branches in many different directions and the choices we make will lead us to one of the different endings.

The enemy in Odyssey goes by the name of Cult of Kosmos, which is none other than the Templars as we know them. Discovering the Cult will open up a new menu through which we'll be able to take a look at the whole Cult's chain of command. Even though most of the cultists are untrackable at first, gathering more information by killing cult members will allow us to reveal their identities and track them down.

Combat
Combat is divided in three specializations: Hunter, Warrior, Assassin. Each of these has many different sets of skills that can be mixed between themselves and used to create various combinations allowing different approaches. We have 4 skills slots shared between Warrior and Assassin skills and another 4 slots that are for Hunter skills only.

Kicking people down from a cliff just like Leonidas in 300? We can do that.
In every combat I engaged in I was able to experiment with a huge spectrum of unique approaches allowing me to lure enemies to their own death, or engage in a battle head on. The animations are smooth and the dodging and parrying mechanics, feeling a bit odd at first, will just come naturally after getting the hang of them.

Most encounters won't feel particularly hard nor daunting unless you purposefully seek stronger enemies to fight or take part in Conquest Battles - which will become available relatively soon in the early game section.

Content
Assassin's Creed Odyssey, much like Origins before, offers hundreds of hours of content divided between main quests (branched in 3 storylines), side quests, exploring and upgrading your gear. There are countless locations that are worthy to be visited and even more mysteries to be uncovered hidden in Greece.
Odyssey can easily take from 100 hours to 200 hours to enjoy its full potential.

🔬 Technical Analysis

Graphics
Stunning enough to leave you with your mouth agape. The world is green, vibrant, with incredible lighting effects (absolutely breathtaking when exploring a forest during sunset) and studded with flourishing locations. The wreckages and sunken temples that we can find under the sea are equally beautiful, sided with a handful of sea creatures.

Music
Especially worth mentioning here is Odyssey's ambient music. In many occasions, whilst exploring, it felt like being thrown back in Skyrim. It's nice, relaxing, pleasing to the ears but it also perfectly transitions to battle themes, picking up its pace.

Performance
The game runs particularly well and I haven't noticed any huge stutters. However, after running the game for some hours with no breaks, a few freezes started happening.

HUD
The HUD is clean with a very similar layout to what we had in Origins. Only the essentials are consistently shown on screen (such as HP, Adrenaline, Skills...) and everything else can be accessed through the menu.

Bugs Encountered
No game-breaking bugs have happened so far, nor did I have problems during quests.
Got stuck a few times while climbing, but letting go (pressing C) usually fixed the problem.

Wrapping up

Ubisoft is taking baby steps in shaping open-world games. Odyssey is the perfect example of this: they're taking many ideas and throwing them at a sticky wall to see what will last on it, in the long run. There are many aspects of Odyssey that overall feel unpolished or unnecessary, however, it's a game that still manages to hit the mark and will still offer the right amount of enjoyment and content for the money it's asking for.

I'm sure this is massively different than most Assassin's Creed games, but that is what drew me in. I never dreamed they would make an RPG (a good one at that).
This game is phenomenal. There is SO much to do. From fighting the frontlines in battlefield form against Athens (or Sparta if you want to keep history logical), to hunting mythological creatures, to assassinating public figures, to hunting down cultists who have their fingers dipped so far into Greece, they control literally everyone, to fighting like a pirate on the seas against a number of enemies, to just plain walking around doing mindless work for people willing to pay a pretty penny, there is just SO much to do in this game.
If you love Greek culture, RPG's, and just plain exploring, this is it. Even if none of those interest you, I promise it's worth a look. 10/10

Witcher's Creed: Shadow of Sparta

This game doesn't even try to hide what it references. Which is totally cool with me!

Not a traditional Assassin's Creed game but it's immersive, enjoyable, and fun- all that matters to me at the end of the day.

Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Origins, with which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNA.

I played nearly 100 hours of Origins but was surprised it received nearly universal praise. Origins is more polished than a typical AC game due to its extra year of development time, and the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderful, but I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealth, combat, and story. Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things. With Origins, it was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’s, but the game was very polished. It ran well and looked gorgeous.

The universal praise Origins received was only skin-deep, full of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core. Odyssey, then, reminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity; an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous game's rough edges.

IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: If you liked Origins and want more of something similar, then you’ll probably love Odyssey. It’s just Origins with deeper and more rewarding roleplaying, far better combat, a much better story, more practical skill trees, and some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new setting.

For more detail, feel free to read on.

The most hyped aspect of the game is its expanded RPG elements. Since Unity, which introduced customizable gear, there have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed series, including the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate. Continuing this trend, Odyssey has become a full-blown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements. It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development, as more effort is put into Odyssey’s main story and side quests, and the addition of dialogue options is a welcome breath of fresh air to the series. This was hampered, though, by some puzzlingly bad voice acting by the main character, Alexios’, voice actor (I didn’t play as Kassandra so I can’t comment on her performance). The story features deeper, more interesting characters than Origins and had me genuinely caring about what happened for the first time since Assassin’s Creed II. Bravo to Ubisoft for realizing that good writing is irreplaceable.

Combat in Origins was one of my chief complaints. The animations felt stilted and artificial, and the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played. The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great. Combat in Odyssey, however, has several more layers of polish. Animations seem more natural, dodging takes place over a judgeable distance, easy countering is back. Adding depth are Adrenal Skills, which basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins. There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill tree, with each providing a different facet than the other.

The skill tree is greatly improved from Origins, which had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly. Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree (different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlocks), which gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear. It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tacked-on because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game”. The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplay.

A lot of the new abilities feel inspired by WB’s Shadow of Mordor series. Chiefly among this inspiration, though, is a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system. Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, and this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at one-another; chiefly Athens and Sparta. Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a living, breathing war going on around you. Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actions, with each city’s forces being easily identifiable, and each occupying different fortresses as they move. They have leaders, cities you can disrupt, money and materiel you can steal and destroy. There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow games, and somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it. It’s the main draw of Odyssey, and it’s a huge one. It all works smoothly, indicative of significant polish, and the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Origins.

There are a number of more minor new features which fixed complaints I had about Origins. Number one of which is a dedicated (though limited to the open world) Quicksave feature for the first time in the Assassin’s Creed series. As a hardcore stealth fan I despise any game that features stealth without quicksaving and makes me rely on checkpoints. It’s too easy to experience a bug (especially in AC games) and have your entire stealth run of a fort become ruined. This alleviates it, and it’s a fantastic quality-of-life addition. There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruiting, deepening stealth gameplay.

History blurbs are also back! This eliminates one of my chief personal complaints about Origins: Ripping out these history blurbs and putting them in a separate gameplay mode from the main game. As a fan of historical fiction I want to learn about these settings as I play, and Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me. They are now back as a map feature, allowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of background.

I do have some complaints, though. The balance of the game is off, requiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am. The leveling system is also far too rigid, turning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges. This should be addressed in a future balance patch. It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveled, but I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustrated.

The game also removed shields from combat, which is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield. I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them go.

The game also runs questionably—my 1080 couldn’t hold 60 fps on ultra settings at 1080p. It needs a performance patch.

In the end, much of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical. You have a pet bird to scout with. The running and climbing animations are the same. The buildings look similar. The graphics are of the same quality. But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deep.

Odyssey fixes Origins’ faults and adds wonderful new features. If you liked Origins or you’re a fan of the series then you’ll love Odyssey. It's the culmination of what the past 3-4 Assassin’s Creed games have been introducing, and it’s become one of my favorites in the series.

Assassin Creed Odyssey was the first game in this series for me.
After 168 hours of playthrough, I can say that the game has taken its place in my heart.
Before buying, I thought about which edition to buy. I chose between the latter two and still chose the Gold edition. This is the best option for me personally and I recommend it to the majority, because it has both a seasonal pass and an additional game of the series, and skins are not important to buy the edition above.
After buying the game, I was very surprised, I did not expect that I would like it so much. I love open worlds and this one was no exception.

Graphics

The graphics in the game are amazing.
While on the islands, we see magnificent buildings, nature, sunsets and sunrises, everything looks very expensive and of high quality.
The sea is not inferior to beauty, water, everything that is there looks gorgeous.
The cutscenes are well filmed and a pleasure to watch.
Separately, I can say about the beauty of the cards of the second expansion. Ellisium, the kingdom of the dead and Atlantis looks divine.

Story

The story in Odyssey is surprisingly quite good for the most part. You have the choice of playing as Alexios or Kassandra. It doesn't really make too much of a difference which one you play, so for my playthrough I chose Kassandra. Either way, you play as a mercenary in ancient Greece during the Pelponesian War, a time of great struggle between the Athenians and the Spartans.
The story starts off basic but it begins to escalate pretty quickly. The first chapter of the game is brilliantly concluded, and after that I found myself hooked. There are three story branches that the game has you follow. You acquire these new branches as you progress through the story. I'm not going to talk about these branches in this review because I honestly think you should discover what they are for yourselves when you play this. What they are, and the way they are revealed, are brilliant. The more you go through the game, the more content is available to you. It can get overwhelming sometimes.
Mutliple choice dialogue is a brilliant addition to Assassin's Creed in my opinion and it makes you feel like you have way more of an impact on the story and the characters. It may not drastically change the course of the game, but the things you say do have consequences.
Does the story retain this level of charm? No, not really. Once you reach the half way point of the game, it begins to fall a bit flat. It's not that it becomes bad, it's just not as good. The level of mystery begins to become a bit stale and the structure of the main quests begins to be a little repetitive. You find yourself having to do other needless things before being able to do the main quest, which can get annoying. As well as this. the ending to the main story branch is a bit weak, and honestly a bit cheesy.

Gameplay

You can play the game using guided mode, or exploration mode. Guided mode was with a compass and icons pointing to where you need to go. Exploration mode removes all of this and makes you figure out where you need to go with the tips you've been given from talking to people or finding notes or letters. This makes the game a lot more challenging and serves as a way more memorable experience to say the least.
You can fight using a variety of different weapons and the introduction of combat abilities makes these fights a lot more exhilarating. You gain a skill point each time you level up which can be used to invest in these abilities.
Executions aren't as impressive in this game. Sometimes the animations don't exactly line up, resulting in the whole thing looking goofy. Assassination executions can sometimes screw you over and get you spotted by other enemies, which can get pretty annoying.
Sea combat is a much more prominent feature in this game since a big portion of the map is ocean. Sea combat was something that I wasn't a fan of in previous games, but Odyssey has done it almost perfectly. It's simple, and it can be really exciting. Your ship can be upgraded using resources, and the more you upgrade, the better your ship can sustain itself. During your travels, you can recruit new people to join your ship. These people will give your ship bonuses and will assist you in boarding other ships.
The game world is split into different regions. Each region is either controlled by the Athenians or the Spartans. One of Odyssey's new game mechanics is the implementation of conquest battles. To unlock a conquest battle, you need to weaken the hold of the controlling faction. Once a conquest battle is unlocked, you can begin a massive battle that will decide who controls the region. You have the ability to choose which side you want to be with.
As well as this, Odyssey introduces bounty hunters. If you commit a crime and it has been witnessed, you risk placing a bounty on yourself. This will send a bounty hunter after you. They are smart and very powerful, and can show up when you least expect it.

Grind

Many players say that the game is full of grind. I partially agree with this.
On the one hand, the game has a bunch of additional tasks that appear on each bulletin board themselves and the player must complete them in order to get the required level to be able to complete the storyline task.
For my part, I initially opened each island to which I was sent and in the end was always a level higher than the level for the task. I love to explore the world, so the grind passed me by.
I didn’t complete the tasks from the bulletin board because I simply didn’t need them.

Сonclusion

Many people say that this is no longer the Assassin Creed, but it doesn't matter to me, because I was not familiar with the series. As a standalone game, it's gorgeous. It has great graphics, a good storyline, great gameplay, a bunch of features and innovations, besides, at the moment the game has a nice discount price, so I cannot but recommend this instance of the gaming industry.

Final Score - 9.5/10

Short Review :
After playing this game more than 150+ hours, this game basically :

( Assassin's Creed especially Black Flag ) + ( Borderlands 2 complete with its grind fest, weapon/item loot system, and skill tree ) + ( Slightly downgraded version of Witcher 3 ) + ( Enemies recruiting system like Metal Gear Solid V ) + ( Huge map with visually stunning graphic ) + ( Microtransaction in full-priced single player games ) + ( Somewhat overkill DRM protection like any other recent Ubisoft games )

Blend all of them together, and voila. Assassin's Creed Odyssey

This is not Assassin's Creed that I used to know. But it still fun game nonetheless.

Detailed Review :

Pros :
+ Huge open world to explore
+ Great graphics. Visually stunning. Beautifully crafted especially in historical location/area.
+ Fairly good storyline.
+ Good gameplay mechanic
+ Decent combat mechanic
+ Somewhat has a huge content to play

Cons:
- Level gating main storyline. Grinding and doing some uninspiring side quest over and over again for the sake of progressing through the main story is not fun at all.
- Resources/Materials is scarce. Resources/Materials needed for enhance/upgrade weapon and armor, upgrade ship, etc.
- Microtransaction in full-priced single player game. They know that not everyone like grinding and hunting for scarce resources/materials. it looks like they design their game this way so they can slap XP boost, materials, etc. And they somewhat can get away with this type of abomination. if another company like EA, Bethesda, etc doing this in their full priced single player games, surely they will got huge backlash over it.
- Somewhat overkill DRM protection. No matter where you buy any recent ubisoft games. It will have at least 3+ DRM layer that consist of something like Denuvo + VMProtect + Uplay. I hope they are not adding something like Always Online DRM type on top of that 3+ layer of DRM in their future games.

I recommend this game, If you are agree with pros more than cons I stated above.
8/10

As you probably know already, most of the gameplay elements of this game are from AC Origins, but they are sufficiently improved to create better experience. There are also some new additions that I think multiple choice dialogue is the best of them.

The graphics are more beautiful than AC Origins and the gameplay is so much fun, especially the naval battles. The story is good and the new dialogue choice system makes it even better. The new customization system is also the best in the series. The only thing I don't like about this game and almost all Ubi games is that it has a poor optimization.

Overall, this game is not perfect, but it takes the series in an amazing new direction. It's absolutely worth the money.

Olympos stands tall, Malaka that was Incredible !

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey blew me away. It is the best game I have ever played by far!. Being Greek, this game made me proud. As an introduction, the blending with history, the depiction of the acropolis, the involvement of historical figures and the accuracy of the characters was amazing. Each part of Odyssey was familiar with history learnt at school (in a more general sense) up to the plague of Athens. The game captures the "Greece" vibe, when playing you feel like you're in the a summer in Greece.

The story was exhilarating, made me miss entire nights to stay up and finish said part of the story. I was overwhelmed by the anticipation of new chapters.

the graphics are amazing (can’t even believe how good they are), and the reconstruction of important historical landmarks is astonishing (Especially Athens).

Battle mechanics are also top level, giving you choices of different builds.

Intrigue, betrayal and choices that have actual consequences are all part of the game. DLC takes you to Atlantis as well.

Ubisoft did a tremendous job in this game and I would strongly recommend it.

After 212 hours, my epic journey through AC Odyssey has finally come to end. What an astonishingly enjoyable game this was, with a shocking amount of content - especially when you factor in the enormous post-launch "Episodes", which themselves ran a good 20 hours or so. Gorgeous visuals, engrossing story, great gameplay, I enjoyed practically every minute of this game which, in my opinion, far exceeded Origins in every practical way.

Performance was a lot better this time, with a handful of tweaks (mainly to the likes of "Volumetric Clouds") I was able to sustain a fairly locked 60fps, for the most part, on my Ryzen 2600X @ 4.2Ghz with a GTX1070. Sadly, like Origins before it, towns and heavily populated areas with a lot of clutter tended to really hammer both CPU and GPU, causing a number of framerate dips and janky "juddering". Thankfully nothing like the abomination that was Origins.

--- sadly the game itself was let down right at the end by the most anti-climactic and woefully unsatisfying ending to the whole thing :( "Chabb" on Reddit explained it best, but be warned of ENORMOUS game spoilers for the game and all six episodes;

For a point of reference, this was the first AC game I played in depth at all. My review of the game will be as an RPG game as opposed to scrutinizing how it fits into the AC collection.

Graphics - excellent detail and scenery. Under and on water areas are done very well and landscapes are some of the most realistic looking I've seen. Character details are good also.

Voice acting - I would say this is very well done. Some improvements could be made in dramatic situations acting wise, but generally quite good.

Gameplay - this is definitely a strength of this game. Movement feels fluid and consistent on land, on a horse, commanding a ship and swimming. I never felt that any one area was weaker than another. They are all well executed, including combat options.

Upgrades - the beginning of the game starts off with very basic moves but once you start getting some special skills, it makes the game more fun via enhancing all aspects of combat. There is a vast array of upgrades for weapons, armor, special skills and for your ship. All have a noticeable impact on gameplay proportionate to the degree of upgrading.

Story - There are numerous side stories via NPCs which are cleverly written. Some are fetch quests as you'd expect with an extensive game with a plethora of quests. Some are ingenious and use mythological themes to play out a story (ie - Supideo). The main storyline is good, more or less what someone would expect in a game of this scope. Not too edgy, but not too vanilla either.

Content - There is a ton of content. It took me about 250 hrs to complete the main quests, several (but not all locations discovered) and all the DLC. The main game alone for me was around 200 hrs. There is also a story creator mode where players can construct their own quests. Also, the Discovery Tour was released which was also done for Origins, but this iteration was reportedly improved in camera focus so the narration better synced with the visuals.

Replayability - The option to play as Alexios or Kassandra and potentially get different reactions from NPCs based on your character and be able to make different choices while also taking advantage of all your established skills and inventory via a new game + mode offers a great opportunity to keep playing. The story creator mode add nearly endless quests to try made by other players.

What would make this game even better? Some even more compelling stories in the quest lines, although this would be a challenge as this game is based on a specific era and characters. A better variety of how the NPCs look would have added more immersion (some were identical copies).

Overall, there is not much to complain about with this game, but much to appreciate. If I didn't have a massive backlog, I would be up for playing it again soon. As an action RPG fan, I would say this is my current favorite game, just slightly edging out Witcher 3. If Witcher 4 had ever come out, it may have eclipsed Odyssey.

This is one massive game. Odyssey now fully consists of RPG elements: a leveling system, talent trees, and dialog options which may affect cutscenes or the ending. You also will opt to choose either Alexios or Kassandra as the main character of your adventure.

Exploration has never been so amazing in this game series. I was so delighted and mesmerized as I explore the world of Greece in this game. Synchronizing viewpoints was one of my favorite activities. Moreover, you will see various "Historical Locations" which I believe might be real places all over Greece. The world design is so complex, every place is pretty much unique - That's what makes it so beautiful.
Like Origins, this world of Odyssey also consists of various tombs (but of course not Pyramids in this one), and after completing it, you will obtain an ability point.

The new combat system has been revised, which makes it even more complex: Each tree grants you various active abilities where you can assign and then use it during a fight. You now collect every piece of gear (head, chest, hands, legs, feet, bow, weapon) and either replace the old ones by new ones, or upgrade by a blacksmith. Compared to Origins, you were gathering materials to upgrade weapon / bow damage. You still have to gather materials to upgrade your gears when going to the blacksmith. Also a new feature called "engraving" whereby you choose to add some additional stats to one of your piece of equipment according to your style of play.

The Naval system is now a crucial part in your journey in the huge world. You will require materials as well to upgrade your ship. You can now add a Lieutenant to your ship, where each will add a beneficial stat to your ship. You get one additional Lieutenant as you upgrade the hull of your ship - up to 4. Whenever you are boarding an enemy ship, those Lieutenants of yours will be helpful, as they will aid you into battle.

Assassination isn't that simple now in this one. You will probably struggle going full stealth if you do not upgrade various Assassination skills in your tree as your Assassination's base damage sometimes might not be enough to 1-hit brutes or captains, or other high-ranked officers. The game is therefore telling you to be smart when choosing your talents...

Music was also one of the big strengths of this game in the series. It really puts you in the mood whenever you are fighting as a spartan. You will also have a lot of emotional moments at some point in time, and the music really plays a big part in that, which makes your adventure even more memorable.

As you progress through the story, there will be many Assassination targets that you will have to kill. As you kill some of them, you will get a clue which will lead you to the next target. Therefore, you will have to dig your way a lot, until you reach to the final target.

I'd say that this game in the series was a pretty big change, and Ubisoft still has room for progression, especially in enhancing the RPG elements. But to this day, this is one of the most impressive games I've played in terms of exploration. It's definitely worth playing, with full of excitement and worth playing again

Pros first:

- After playing AC Odyssey for about 124 hours, I haven't finished both DLCs, nor have I finished every side quest in the main game, which means you have A LOT to do in this game
- The world of Odyssey looks beautiful & stunning! The colors are vibrant, the textures are sharp, armor & weapons got a lot of lovely details
- The humor of this game is just great
- You're allowed to decide if you want to be a humble hero or a cocky bastard
- The story itself is interesting & has some little nice twists to it
- You're able to get the shop items for free when you do daily quests & collect orichalcum
- The ship battles are a lot better than in AC Origins
- You have a big varity of weapons & stats to choose from
- You can get a unicorn from a simple merchant, how great is that? Rainbows & glitter for everyone!
- the mercenary system is pretty neat & gives you many great perks like cheaper upgrades for your armor
- Photo mode

Now the big Cons:

- The game is hella repetitive, seriously. 90% of the time you're sneaking into camps, kill everyone, steal the treasure, burn down the supplies, free some poor captured villagers. You do this over & over again until you can kill the leader of the state. & Then you do the exact same thing all over again. All. The. Time. It was fun the first few hours, it was okay for the next 50 hours, but after 100 hours it's just bloody annoying. Your side quests demand to do this acitivity & your main quests also demand you to do it. If you don't have to sneak into camps, you get quests like: kill 5 sharks, destroy 5 ships, kill 10 archers, kill 10 this, that, you name it.
That's why I haven't brought myself to do every single side quest. It's becoming tedious & frustrating.

- For the main story, you have to kill cultists. They are evil, they make people sick, they want to lead the world (just like the templars from previous AC games). This is fun, until you realize that you get the exact same mission for the first DLC. Again: everything got recycled.

- You think you have more varity in the second DLC: no. You sneak into camps again, kill leaders again, etc. While the new areas look very beautiful & refreshing & new, your quests remain the exact same.

- The grind in this game is real. Like even when you get the mercenary bonus in which every upgrade is 50% cheaper, you will still have to grind the hell out of materials just to upgrade one single armor piece or weapon. The same goes for your ship btw.

- It is no Assassin's Creed anymore. The game now turns all around the Isu, the parkour isn't good or even there, sneaking into buildings from windows is not really given anymore. Therefore it is a good RPG, but no AC anymore.

Overall it is a fun & beautiful game, if you don't mind repetitive gameplay or taking bigger breaks between each play sassion, then this game is for you. If you're someone who wants to play everything through at once & get annoyed by doing the same things for 120-200 hours, then I'd say pass Odyssey or get it on sale as well.

I’ve played almost every AC game in existence. From the Ezio trilogy to this. And while it’s true that this is only an AC game by name, that doesn’t mean the game is bad. I’ve played 122 hours of this game and had lots of fun with it. From the surprisingly good gameplay to the funny conversations. THIS is what I call a good open world game.

STORY:
You play as a mercenary in Greece during the Pelponesian war. And from then on, you find out about a secret organization that’s plotting to take over Greece. So of course it’s your job to stop them by teeming up with familiar faces and taking them out. The story has some twist and turns which caught me off guard most of the time. Although the final act seems a bit weak if you ask me. Nevertheless, it’s still good and funny sometimes lol.

You also have dialogue choices that do have consequences. It’s not as deep as some other games but it does its job.

GRAPHICS:
The graphics of this game look great, but the optimization is terrible. I played this game on an i7 6700k. Most of the time my CPU went to 100% usage and was between 80-95%. Really wished Ubisoft fixed it. Otherwise, the game is detailed and pretty to look at.

GAMEPLAY:
The combat in this game is superb. The number of weapons and abilities you can use is astounding. From swords to spears to hammers. This game has it all. You can mix and match between abilities to give you some sick builds. You want to be a tank that outputs massive damage? Go on ahead. A glass cannon that’s fast and nimble? No problemo.

The quests are great. You’ve got legendary beasts quests where you fight monsters, Naval quests and the usual quests. Surprised that I wasn’t bored from them lol.

I’ve heard from a lot of people that the games is grindy and that you need to buy time savers in order to have fun. WRONG. If you play the game like you would any open world RPG, you’d see the opposite. I was over-leveled by the end because I played the game as intended: By doing side quests and exploring. Don’t listen to those who tell you otherwise.

VERDICT:
While AC: Odyssey isn’t the typical AC game we’ve known and love. It’s still an amazing game that’s fun to explore. Combat is amazing, story is decent, and overall the game deserves to be played as long as your specs are good.

I RECOMMEND.

Not gonna lie, Super Mario Odyssey took a weird turn with this sequel.

AC Odyssey is freaking amazing. It’s like Shadow of Mordor meets Witcher 3, meets AC Black Flag. I don’t know about you but that sounds like a great combination to me. This game alone took 100 hours of my virgin life the first week of having it.

It’s the Dark Souls of Assassins Creed- IGN probably.

In all seriousness, the game turned out a lot better than I expected. I went in with a little doubt since people were so divisive about it. But it just engages you at the start in such a way, I have never seen AC do that before, not since playing the Ezio games at least. I hope they have such cinematic storytelling in future games as well. The story certainly isn’t grounded, but it lives up really well to the history setting like the previous titles. Some moments even got my ♥♥♥♥ hard.

I feel like people have been very harsh to this game. I agree that the hardcore RPG elements pushes away most old school AC players because honestly very few people enjoy the grind. These elements are very monetizable, so obviously Ubisoft will get it’s ♥♥♥♥ hard over it. Other than that everything is really well done.

Assassins Creed or not, I’ve always wanted to play a Spartan, so here I am recommending it. A light 8/10 though. The game should have had more Markos flexing his vineyard.

Anyhow, it’s all fun and games until Kratos shows up.

Decent game. Don't pay full price for it, get it on sale and also don't do too many in-game missions unless you wanna risk getting burnt out. The world is massive and although it's all gorgeous and there's tons of stuff to do, just like any other Ubisoft game it can get repetitive very, very quickly. Story is good, characters are good, voice acting is great especially for Kassandra. Also you get to meet Herodotus which is cool.

Background

I wonder why I waited several months writing this. I had fun and clocked over 200 hours with the latest entry in the Assassin's Creed series. My own odyssey with the franchise began around the time Brotherhood was released. I started from the beginning and never skipped an episode (emphasis is on the main titles released for the PC) with the exception of Liberation. However, before Odyssey I did purchase the remastered version of episode III so I could finally assist Aveline against the Templars in New Orleans. I checked one of the Chronicles games (didn't care much for it) and also watched Fassbender in action as Callum Lynch. The image of him being attached to a mechanical arm is still haunting my dreams.

In Ancient Times

Yep, we are back, but this time the setting is Ancient Greece. In fact, the story takes place hundreds of years before Origins. The map is huge (certain sources claim it is 2.5 times as big as it was before) and we have a lot of islands to travel to. Some are truly gorgeous and I did notice that I always looked for photo opportunities when exploring a new location. Frankly, I preferred Origins as the desert with its sandstorms and mirages was truly one of a kind, however, the new setting is also great. Visiting Mount Taygetus with its snowy tops, discovering an uncharted island with a huge Poseidon statue, doing quests in Mykonos while enjoying the scenic view, looking for a tablet (no, the one without a circuit board!) underwater in the Red Lake Bay... just to name a few memorable things. We traverse forests, visit theatres, stealth kill enemies near ancient ruins and stop at several waterfalls to enjoy their sight. Historical characters await: Socrates will annoy us several times, Herodotos accompanies us during our seafaring quests and we even help Hippokrates save people. Oh, and just because Lucy Lawless portrayed a skinny, athletic Xena in the '90s the lady you meet in Odyssey is much more... well, heavily built.

Modern Times

Before moving on to other cool stuff let's look at Layla Hassan a bit. This part of the game was a total letdown. We get out of the Animus to be able to look around in our temporary HQ but bear in mind the next time you do this it will be in another location. So, check your laptop with all your documents and read all the e-mails before diving in once more. I miss Desmond and his companions. The creators themselves confirmed they are unsure where to go with this part of the story. What a shame as Layla is quite likeable! Hopefully, this will be extended further in the upcoming title Valhalla.

Siblings & Dialogues & Choices

You'd say this we already saw in Syndicate as we had the opportunity of controlling the Frye twins. The difference now is that we pick between Kassandra and Alexios at the beginning and there will be no coming back. Would you like to play as a woman all along after picking a man? Come back for a 2nd playthrough, then. My choice was Kassandra and from what I read on the internet the dialogues are identical for both - even the gear they begin with is the same. Many say the acting on Kassandra's part is much better.

So why do a new walkthrough? Because we have decisions this time. In Origins we saw how the creators decided on exploring the RPG path and in Odyssey it is ever more present. Sometimes dialogue selections only mean hearing more background info on a particular task we have to do. At other times the selection ends in a massacre, threat or even in lovemaking. I liked how a small icon was placed at the end of these lines warning you of the outcome. So, like in a Bioware game, if you feel like you went down on the good side and now it's a good time to become a renegade, pick a new gender and alternative choices. As decisions are offered at key events in the story this also means a different endgame for the first time in the series!

Another thing introduced is the notoriety. Forget Bayek and his police-like role as this time you play as a misthios, a mercenary. You can attack anybody anytime - a lot of lootable chests or jars are private property. Civilians notice what you are doing and they react accordingly. Should you get into a heated battle with the locals (be it Athenians or Spartans) even civilians can join the fight. They immediately obtain the weapons of fallen soldiers - if they fail to do so prepare for the good old-fashioned fisticuffs. Every territory is owned by either Athens or Sparta – you can join them on the battlefield to claim a new territory (these battles are massive with dozens of combatants present!) but you will never become truly an ally to either. As a mercenary you are neutral and you can complete missions in the interest of both.

Sailing on Ancient Waters

Seafaring returns which partially explains why the map is significantly bigger. Although we have to make do with javelins and arrows instead of cannons, naval battles can still be entertaining. Athenians and Spartans mind their own business but be careful when it comes to pirates and mercenaries. Fewer equipment does not necessarily mean fewer updates. A lot of resources must be spent if we wish to achieve the most powerful form of our Adrestia. Looting on sea allows us to get the applicable cosmetics: figureheads, texture for the hull and the mast and even the crew can look different. You can also hire lieutenants: they improve the attributes of our seafaring abilities. Even bad guys (from a simple soldier to the deadly mercenaries) can be hired. This is a bit tricky as instead of doing a killing blow we have to knock them out. I remember using Bayek as one of the legendary captains along with Charon, the ferryman. Additional (dozens) cosmetics are available in the store for Helix currency. This system was well-known (and annoyed many players) in Origins already.

Soldiers of Fortune

The mercenary system introduced in Origins is now much bigger and more interesting. We often bump into one such soldier but as long as we are not notorious we are not attacked. It is possible to find a mercenary with such a high level at the beginning of the game that only dozens of hours later will we be able to kill them. If we are not interested in the constant challenge, we can just pay certain sponsors to remove the bounty on our heads. Otherwise prepare for an exciting battle with an enemy you can consider as a miniboss. We can check their abilities during the encounter and see if they have a weak point (for instance, extra damage from fire or poison). The gear we get can be really good and defeating one means replacing its position in the hierarchy. Once we cleared a tier, we enter another so that we can reap additional benefits. Aim for the top tier as becoming number 1 is immensely satisfying. Mercenaries are randomly generated - becoming the best does not make the system obsolete. Encounters will last until you play the game.

Switching Into Full Gear

Aiming towards the RPG experience once more! We have more items (armor) to add and set pieces also appear. For those of you willing to explore all locations and doing all quests obtaining all set pieces is a great bonus. I liked the fact that getting hold of a new item unlocks its „look” so if you replace it with a newer one you can still keep the skin / texture.

As tier bonuses include vendor-related bonuses we have fewer skills available as the unnecessary onces were removed. Emphasis is still on aiming toward the 3 possible playstyle: hunter, warrior or assassin. I preferred the middle but by the end of the game I could still purchase all skills (many with all their additional levels).

I'll start by saying I was never a big fan of the franchise.
With the exception of Black Flag, I found most of the games kind of silly, the gameplay boring and repetitive.
Long story short, in comes Origins, which changed a lot in the series for the better.
But then, then came this jewel of a game Odyssey.

This game is like no other AC game, it is light years better, ahead, above and beyond in every respect.
-The visuals are stunning. I could play this 400hours and marvel at its beauty.
-The mission are excellent, the story is mesmerizing.
-Attention to detail is incredible, there is so much history, mythology, everything was crafted by love in this game.
-Even the smallest side missions can be a real treat to play, nothing ever feels out of place or repetitive.
-The acting is Oscar worthy. I picked Kassandra which I would definitely recommend, as shes probably one of the top game characters ever. she's impeccable. She came to life and she's a badass.
-The addition of multiple choice replies was a game changer too.

They have continued heading toward the RPG genre, and it's exactly where AC should've been all along. It's clear now.
The closest game to compare to this one would be the Witcher 3 in my opinion.

Ubisoft came a long way with the franchise, they completely changed this game for the better. it started with origins and reached a wonderful peak with odyssey, I hope they keep going in this direction, the next AC if this one is anything to go by, might be one of the best games ever.

Rumors have it that the next Assassins Creed Will be called Ragnarok, will be set in English and Scandinavian empires, a Viking setting and time line, with quite a few additions, such as settlement management etc. Whatever it is, I am quite excited for it.
I hope they continue heading in this direction with this franchise.

On a minor note I was quite pleased with the addition of steam achievements.

Do not miss this gem, if you're a fan of action and RPG games, or AC games, heck any game, this game should not be skipped.

A very fun game. Unfortunately, will not run if you cannot connect to Ubisoft. So you cannot run this singleplayer game without an internet connection.

Absolutely delightful.

Tons of stories to experience. Thank to whoever decided to implement cringe and hillarious moments to some of those stories.

I would like to thank to developers for this great odyssey because meeting Hippocrates, Herodotos and Socrates was amazing. Characters in this game are seriously well written and its unique experience to interact with them.

Huge world to explore (around 16km square) plus DLC maps (3).
The way you progress in this world is well made. World level up with you (you can disable that if you like but i am against it)

Since its ancient greek there are stories about mythical creatures and gods. (Thats all i am gonna say)

While i can say, go and get this great game where you have easily over 100h of gameplay, there are some parts i personaly dont like.
For example
- You slow down if you are close to fort, village and/or city. This is really annoying.
- Horse pathfinding if actually slightly worse than in AC:Origin. Especially in cities.
- Your character have trouble to climb some walls. Especially cliffs.
- Skills could have couple different animations since combat is huge part of this gameplay and it gets little repetetive to see the same animation over and over again.
- Final upgrades for ship are kinda too expensive. I have over 160hrs in this game and i wasn't able to fully upgrade my ship
- DLC stories or in fact any other stories rarely reacts on your other stories you finished. For example if you dealt with main villain group and you start some other quest, they are not aware of this and your character doesnt have a clue either. This is slightly annoying.

Dont cry about big ass open sea area. I spend very small amount of time at sea because there is little to nothing to do except talking with Barnabas.

But its overall well managed. Story telling is AMAZING and your choices in some cases really matter.
Origin and Odyssey are must have for assassins creed fans. Yes the combat system is brand new and feels kinda weird from start but its must have for the story.

Honestly i didnt enjoy other game as this one for quite some time.

Maláka! Truly an Odyssey worthy of Odysseus' tales!
This is Ubisoft's AC saga at its pinnacle.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey 
A Screenshot of Assassin's Creed Odyssey

Personal Rating 90%
Although they still engage in despicable DLC microtransaction practices such as the enhanced XP or resource gain timesavers; and they still attempt to artificially stretch the playtime of this gem with XP grind necessary even for the main story quests or very tanky bosses with simple movesets and so on and so on...

Ubisoft has outdone itself with this project and its presentation; and one can really feel the influence of CDPR's masterpiece on this.

Strong Points
Kassandra is the coolest Assassin since Altaïr, Ezio and Edward Kenway
Great family drama as the focal point of the story incorporating Leonidas and his 300's battle at thermopylai and all sorts of mythological aspects of Greece converging with the Isu storyline later in the Fate of Atlantis DLC
Good attempt to represent multiple cultural facets of Greek Polis and its inhabitants
Mythological creature the Sphinx as a boss both beatable through conversation with a riddle aside from combat; felt like in Witcher 3 there for a moment! Chapeau Ubisoft!
Protagonists mercenary life and contending mercenary mechanic is a nice fresh touch diminishing redundancy of the game design
Good Cult of Cosmos mechanic and creative ambivalent characters in it
Phobos and Ikaros!
Very strong cinematic intro with Leonidas
Excellent voice acting and very compelling characters from Kassandra, Markos and Phoibe...to Alexios, Myrrine, Nikolaos, Herodotos, Barnabas, Brasidas and many many more!
Awesome voice acting and choices matter story paths in the trials of the Atlantis DLC with Persephone, Hades and Poseidon
Amazing threefold Magnum Opus [Fate of Atlantis DLC] which takes you to Elysium, Hades' underworld and Atlantis
Atlantis DLC elevates the plot in the contemporary time; making it feel less static and distinct from the main story juxtaposition
Quest design much better than we are used to in Assassins Creed titles
Graphics are incredibly gorgeous
Huge open world for exploration on land and under water
Very neat and good looking UI
Great screenshot tool
Good combat system
Good riddles
Decent romancing
Great melee skill and finisher animations
Good naval combat
All NPCs are recrutable to the crew of the Adrestia
Tons of customization for the ship and for the character; visual armor layer possible!
Complex progression and skill trees which makes the combat much less monotonous than it was in Origins
Skill trees have additional divine transcendence component
Good OST both original and emphasizing origins of the saga by making a new rendition of "Ezios Family" the central melody of the game
Great visuals of choices matter dialogues very reminiscent of the methodology in the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
Good investigation design; also feels like Geralt is examining corpses
Several difficulties; not just in terms of combat but also regarding clues and quest conduction

Assassin's Creed Odyssey

Weak Points
Story feels unnatural as Alexios in several moments; Kassandra playthrough recommended!
Very greedy micro-transaction DLC practice and time savers
Still a lot of repetitiveness coming up in terms of Camp clearing, looting, sabotage and assassinations
Open world may be huge but just does not tap in to that level of interaction demonstrated in Red Dead Redemption 2
Looting can feel overkill at times...
Horse speed limit
Significant artificial stretching of playtime through XP grind and commanders, mercenaries & bosses that are too tanky
Way too lengthy conquest grind, especially in Elysium!
No melee skill animations on beasts and creature bosses
Combat under water just feels a bit off even though it naturally should
Combat is good but not great; counter far too generous in terms of timing
Several choices in quests suggest a different outcome when it is actually just an illusion and you will have to kill that person anyway just later for instance

Kassandra the Eagle Bearer; Misthios, Captain of the Adrestia, Pankration Champion, Champion of the Arena, descendant of Leonidas, Dikastes and finally Demigod...

Despite my few complaints, Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey truly is an incredibly entertaining game that proves Origins was no fluke. I’m back on the hype train, baby, and I can’t wait to see where the next stop is (even if I wish it’d rest at the same station for another year or two). No longer a simple stealth game, but instead a massive, detailed, sprawling roleplaying game, Odyssey just might be one of my favorite games of 2018 so far.


Pros:

-A vast, utterly engrossing story
-Best heroes to date
-A world that keeps on giving

Cons:

-Repetitive Caves's, Military Camps's, Fort's, (etc) layouts!!

Assassin's Creed: Odyssey is a truly massive game, befitting of the name 'Odyssey.' I have played several other Assassin's Creed games, but none of them have grabbed me in the same way that Odyssey did. I didn't want to play anything else for weeks after it was released, and I still don't. Unfortunately, having completed all the branches of the main quest and all the side quests I could find, I am left waiting for the DLC to follow, as well as some light achievement hunting and resource hoarding. But I still itch to get into the world, to explore the last few question marks on my map and to finish out all the locations, and to sail the waters, wreaking havoc on pirates (and, honestly, any ships with shiny epic sails and a chance of good loot!).

For me, this game was different from all the other Assassin's Creed titles. Some part of this was due to the newly-added roleplaying elements. Although not extensive -- the "branching dialogue" is inconsequential in many of the scenarios, so in some sense it's an illusion of choice -- they do give one a feeling of control and ownership of the story. I felt very invested in the story of Kassandra. No spoilers here, but I can say that I enjoyed the twists and turns of the story. There is still the perennial Assassin's Creed problem -- the shoehorning of historical figures into important narrative roles isn't any more charming here than it ever is, but it did help to provide a framework for the overarching story.

The gameplay was phenomenal, with fluid and cinematic combat (on foot, at sea, and in conquest battles). I've read that a lot of people mentioned falling behind in levels, necessitating a kind of 'grind' to get to a level that allowed progression of one of the quest branches. I didn't have this problem until very late in the main story, but even then I didn't feel like I was being deprived of continuing with the story. There was so much to do in terms of different story arcs, side quests, bounties, exploration, etc. that it was just a matter of doing something else fun. Oftentimes I forgot about going back to what I needed leveling up for, becuase I was having too much fun sacking forts, sinking pirates, finding treasure, assassinating leaders, etc. to want to rush back to the story quest. It probably helps that I was obsessed in early stages with completing everything from an area before I moved on, so I was usually a few levels ahead. Your mileage may vary.

I found the mercenary aspects to be the game's less compelling. Instead of choosing a loyalty to Athens or Sparta, you will basically kill, sabotage, attack, rob, and otherwise harrass both Athenians and Spartans -- there is no way around that. There are no consequences for this, aside from a few lines of dialogue throwing shade, but it bothered me a little bit. It wasn't that the system didn't work or wasn't good -- it was a lot of fun to go around, lowering the stability of the regions, fighting the conquest battles, and collecting that sweet, sweet loot. So the problem was really a matter of my incorrect expectations, rather than any fault of the game.

In addition to the gameplay, which I found engaging and fun, the game is truly beautiful. The cities are well-designed and feel real and lived-in. The character designs are astonishingly well done. Not only are both Kassandra and Alexios really great looking, but other characters look phenomenal as well.

My only regret about this game is that I can't go back in time and experience it for the first time again. Here's hoping for massive brain trauma resulting in amnesia!

Main Game: 10/10

Gameplay: 9/10
Combat was great, stealth was satisfying, playing as a bow master was an interesting added challenge. My only gripe was that if you specialized in assassin, there were many times where stealth was not an option and you were forced into combat you weren't fully effective at. Despite that, the RPG elements were an amazing addition to this series. I really liked having a choice over how my character played, being able to customize both her look and her gear to suit my play-style. Ship combat was great, I enjoyed the RPG style upgrades. It wasn't Black Flag great, but this isn't a pirate game, so I'm impressed with how much effort they put into it.

Story: 9.5/10
This is highly subjective, but I found myself agonizing over choices that actually felt meaningful and had an impact on the overall game. It was brilliantly done, I took off .5 points because of the debacle that is the modern day storyline.

Graphics: 10/10
It's literally gorgeous. Viewpoint scenes really showed it off on my ultrawide. Animations, cutscenes, facial expressions, all of it is beautiful. Taking screenshots of gorgeous moments in front of awe-inspiring scenery can become addicting.

Replayability: 10/10
As I mentioned above, your choices matter. You can definitely replay and get some minor changes in the story arc and some major different plot twists. You also have two distinct main characters to choose that will mildly change some things (mainly in the DLC). There is also an option for new game plus.

Content: 10/10
Not including DLC you can easily spend 100+ hours on this game, including DLC you could probably hit close to 200 and still have stuff to do. This game is packed with meaningful content I actually want to do. Not just filler and fetch quests.

DLC 1: 7/10 -- It felt lackluster, no new scenery, just more quests, which is fine, I didn't want it to end, but my choices felt pointless. The developer had a story in mind and nothing I said or did could change that story playing out.

DLC 2: 9/10 -- This was just a breath of fresh air. Finally jumping into the mythology headfirst instead of vague allusions. You are actually there! In Elysium, the Underworld and Atlantis. I thoroughly enjoyed all the episodes of DLC, but I would rank my favorites in this order: Episode 2, Episode 1, Episode 3. The story allowed for choices to affect the outcome, unlike the first DLC, but it did feel slightly sloppy and rushed towards conclusion, but it's forgivable since they give a sizable amount of content as a DLC. The modern day ending post DLC was not my favorite. It felt so untidy... I didn't even know I was DONE until I did a google search. You get modified abilities throughout which allows you to change your playstyle. You get access to some pretty sick end game weapons. There's a good chunk of content and it definitely takes time to fully get through. I would give the story about a 7/10, but all the other aspects really drags it back up to a 9 IMO.

Overall:

One of the best games I've played. The Modern Day storyline was a bit convoluted and confusing, but the main game was great. The DLC was good and definitely worth it, but I did feel a sense of lacking the freedom of choice that I had in the main game. My favorite DLC episode was episode 2 of the Atlantis chain. The hunt DLC was meh tbh. One of the story arcs felt really forced down my throat. I think what kept me motivated to push through it was the promise of Atlantis when I finished (not that you can't do Atlantis first, I just wanted to beat them all in order)

I didn't 100% percent the game, but I did complete all quests, collect all gear, kill all bosses/cult, collect all viewpoints, etc. including the DLC.... It took me about 100 hours to do. I played as Kassandra, because I preferred her voice actor.

So many negative arguments like : "this is not an AC". "this is more like an Open world God Of War". "the main characters is far from Assassin's character." and another bla, bla, bla.
DUDE! this game happened in Greece 399 BC, no assassins with hidden blade in those period, only "Misthios" and corrupt politicians. that is why Odyssey has a very different concept than any other AC.
So if you're looking for traditional AC, this isn't a game that you were looking for. BUT, if you wished for a Great story of an Ancient Greek with a stunning graphic, AC Odyssey is recommended. Why? I played this game during the lockdown and it felt like I've been traveling from ASIA to Ancient Greece, everything was heavenly Greek, especially the beach. The story was wonderful too, you would see how Historical characters such as Socrates, Hippocrates, and etc, become the problem solver of the main character's problems.

So in the end, this game is worth to buy and play.

250+ hours of playtime, 2 times finishing the whole game with a Level 99 + 4 character it's time to review.

This is one of these games you will never want it to finish. Actually some moment I thought I've found a game I'll play for years. Like a Single Player MMORPG (yes, it's my dream :P) however Ubisoft announced that there won't be any more DLC's or expansions for Odyssey, which I still mourn today.

If you are going to buy, buy it with all the DLC's included; believe me it's gonna worth it. Odyssey is really a complete adventure where you'll lose yourself in spectacular views of Mediterranean Sea and extremely well written stories. Every quest is another adventure and chasing the Greek Mythology was like a dream!

I've finished the game in maximum difficulty with kill or be killed actions and all I can say is I'd try even harder if there was any option.

If you're an RPG fan, no matter how much you're familiar to AC universe, it's a must-have game.

I'll be talking about this game after 10 years like I still do about Baldur's Gate, Fallout, Vampire the Masqurade etc.

Have fun and don't forget to kudos devs!

A True Greek Epic

Assassins Creed Odyssey is Ubisoft’s most recent release in the Assassins Creed franchise. Odyssey is the most expansive game yet and is truly worthy of the name Odyssey. I also believe it’s the best AC game yet, even beating out AC 2 for me which I’ve played through roughly eight times. There’s a truly astonishing amount of quality content here, I’m probably about halfway through with 40 hours logged in the game.

Positives:
This game is absolutely gorgeous. My laptop isn’t quite up to scratch, so I’ve been playing it on medium settings on a lower resolution and I’m still really enjoying the scenery here. Many of the islands are truly stunning and the cities you explore look great too.

What a great setting for an Assassins Creed game. I really liked Origins’ Egypt but as someone with an interest in the Ancient Greeks this game ticked all the boxes. The islands are well varied, the cities feel different to one another and the waters around the islands are well suited for the return of naval gameplay. More than any other AC game I really felt immersed in Odyssey’s Greece and it felt like I was really exploring it. Plus, you get to meet some of history’s most well-known people.

The combat system of Origins has returned but it comes with refinements that make it smoother and more enjoyable. The key difference being that it is now much easier to fight groups of enemies, even if you’re locked on to an individual. There’s great weapon variety here, with each type of weapon offering a different fighting style and the bow is incredibly useful too, even in combat. There’s also a good variety of enemies offering different challenges.

The main story is compelling, but what’s better is that many of the side stories are compelling too. Ubisoft seemingly took some hints from the Witcher and I was very impressed by how often I was actually interested in the story around side-quests. Those that break off into multiple quests are particularly good here. The non-story aspects are great too, i.e. the mercenary and cultist systems. Getting hunted by mercenaries when you commit crimes or tracking them down to rise the mercenary ranks is great fun, and often challenging. Finding clues to unveil members of the Cult, who you can then track down and assassinate is really satisfying too, especially when you’re getting close to wiping out a bloodline. Hunting down cultists also gets you a piece of a legendary armor set (specific to each bloodline) that gives you a powerful bonus once complete, another reason this was quite compelling.

Everything can be upgraded, which is particularly nice when it comes to weapons and armor. If you get a sword you particularly like, you can just upgrade it when you level up so that you can keep it powerful enough to take on the enemies you’re encountering. Being able to upgrade stuff is particularly nice once you start using legendary gear. You also get a lot of upgrade options for the Adrestia (your ship) which make it more powerful, I would say upgrading the ship is actually more important that the weapons as you’re really screwed against high level enemies if you have a basic ship.

There’s three different skill trees here that offer different skills. One focuses on range, another on stealth and the final is focused on combat. All three have great skills and what you pick will depend more on how you like to play than what’s objectively good. Most of the skills can be levelled up to improve their effect on you. They’re not only helpful, but really fun to play around with to. The Spartan Kick is by far my favorite.

Greece is in the middle of the Athenian-Spartan war when the game takes place, and as such different islands are controlled by one or the other faction (with the exception of some uninhabited islands and a pirate island or two). Much like the Stormcloak-Imperial war in Skyrim, you’re free to ignore it or get stuck into it, and there’s a lot to do related to this aspect of the game. You can lower a faction’s influence on the island in numerous ways (such as killing soldiers, pillaging war chests and destroying supplies) and once the faction is weak enough you can take part in a battle to either defend the island or attack it (depending on which faction you want to support, you don’t have to stick to one). What’s cool is that this all happens by itself whether or not you get involved. It takes longer, but you may see a battle available on one island and then the next time you come back, the faction in control has changed.

As I mentioned, there really is an enormous amount of content here, and I’m really impressed by how consistent the quality is. Combine that with an excellent setting and fun gameplay and you’re getting a lot of bang for your buck with this game.

I’ve only played Kassandra (I think she’s more popular anyway) but I found the writing to be good as well as the voice acting. She’s a pretty interesting character and it was nice to see that there are plenty of opportunities in the game to make meaningful choices.

Sea Shanties are back!

Negatives:
I felt that the upgrades, in particular for the ship, were too expensive. You really have to grind to get the ship upgraded because you don’t get the ship resources as often just by playing the game as you do for the weapons and armor upgrades. As I mentioned, you’re screwed if your ship isn’t good enough so if you want to travel through higher level areas it’s really bloody difficult unless you’ve upgraded your ship a bunch. I also wish that weapon and armor upgrades were cheaper, I found that I could only afford to fully upgraded my legendary sets every four or five levels. There’s so much good content in this game that I really don’t want to be spending my time grinding.

Having a huge map also means there’s a lot of travelling around. I felt like there weren’t enough synchronization points (fast travel points) in the game and as much as I love the setting here, if you’re going to the same place over and over again, it gets a bit dull. For example, Athens only has one fast travel point, despite being a sprawling city.

Painfully long loading times.

Verdict:

AC Odyssey is the best game yet in the Assassins Creed franchise. There is an overwhelming amount of great content spread out across a fantastic setting. If you’re a fan of the franchise, or RPGs in general, then this game is a must-have.

NO, I haven't played any other game from the same series.
YES, I am Greek so I guess this played its part too.
No, I haven't finished it but I have played enough to see its gameplay.
AND YES, this game is really good.

For the experienced players, there is not much to add. Familiar mechanics, a bit improved as usual over last game, in a new setting. For the new ones like me, I was really pleasantly surprised. I am not a big fan of the yearly series but this game is solid fun. Great graphics although a bit heavy for my PC (Intel 2500k, GPU AMD 480, 8GB, average 30-50 FPS all maxed) with many options to lower the aspects you want to sacrifice for more FPS, great sound and music, especially the random voices which are in ancient Greek. Too bad these can be enjoyed only by Greeks and philhellenes because they improve the immersion greatly.

But best of all ingredients is the atmosphere. If you liked the movie "300" you will love this too. The game even begins with you as Leonidas in the tutorial. I was impressed by all the historical information you get as well and I don't mean just the text. Everyday life, clothes, names, myths, it's like all school history books from that era came to life. Great work indeed.

The game really feels and plays like you are in the middle of Ancient Greece, Hellas to be precise, during its glorious but troubling past. If you like our ancient culture, buying and playing it is a great gift to yourselves. If not, well you can still get it in a couple of years, as I read that there will be no Creed game next year, during a sale as it's a great game nevertheless.

Hu-ah!!!

Great Assassins Creed game with RPG focus.

Definitely full of content, there are a lot of tasks to do:
- Main story around 40 hrs
- Each DLC adds about 10 hrs each
- Huge map to explore, and equipment to collect
- Perfect match for people without friends

pretty decent game. it's a 7/10 from me

pros:
- nice looking graphic
- good combat system
- awesome naval battle and customization (i love the fact that you can recruit lieutenants from all over the greek world to make your ship stronger and look cool, and you can also customize your crew appearance to make your ship even cooler)
- great character customization (the outfits are awesome. i like wearing the achilles armor. makes me feel like a badass)
- awesome mythical creature boss fight (they're not as awesome as origins when fighting anubis, sekhmet, and sobek, but the boss fight's still awesome)

cons:
- microtransaction (it takes a long time to level up so either you do the boring side quests for xp or buy the xp booster to be able to proceed further. or maybe just use a trainer like i did cuz i don't got time for side quests)
- poor quest design (some main quest feels like a side quest, and side quests are just not fun at all but you feel like you should do them to get some xp and cool rewards)
- awkward romance (feels like all your character want to do is have sex with every romanceable characters they just met asap, but the romanceable characters always tells you: do this, this, and this.. and then we'll have sex)
- not an assassin's creed game (you're not an assassin in this game. you're a mercenary)

conclusion:
decent game. just don't buy this on full price. wait for a sale

After 295 hours, my opinion is that, this is one of the greatest games ever made. Certainly the best Assassins Creed game by far.

To make it simple, here is a list of pros and cons.


PROS :
1. Easy control.
2. Very satisfying and fluid combat mechanics.
3. User friendly, easy to understand RPG system. It's not too overly complex like witcher 3.
4. Weapons don't break, there's no need to worry about fixing your equipmemts.
5. Extremely good graphics. So good, you can say it's better than real life.
6. Enormous content within the game
7. Huge open world. In fact calling it huge doesnt do it justice, its f#####g GIGANTIC.
8. Huge variety of weapons and armor.
9. THE F#####G MERCENARY SYSTEM ! This is what makes the game even more fun than it already is. You do enough crime, and powerful bounty hunters are coming after you no matter where you are (except in atlantis) and it's always fun to fight them.
10. The mythical creatures. There are about 4 of them scattered throughout the map, and it's seriously fun to hunt them down.
11. NAVAL COMBAT
12. The fate of Atlantis DLC which is pretty much almost as big as the base game itself
13. The engravings, which can turn your character into a murderous and almost immortal demigod

Cons:
1. Really bad story in my opinion
2. No shield despite your character being an Ancient Greek mercenary.
3. It will get too Grindy after you reach level 70, you will spend a considerable amount of hours grinding in order to get enough money and resources to upgrade your equpments.


VERDICT
As someone who has played this game for almost 300 hours, I can safely say, this game deserves the score of 9 out of 10. It's huge, it's fun. There are so many places to explore, monsters to hunt down and kill, quests to complete, Weapons and armors to acquire.

it's worth your money, so go ahead and enjoy the game.

Game seems great until around level 25.

This is where the grind kicks in. Suddenly you are getting story missions that are 6 levels ahead of you. Now you are forced to do HOURS of side missions that are poorly written dumb fetch quests.

"GO TO THIS FORT AND OPEN A CHEST"


Once you realize they sell real money XP boosts you suddenly realize why they force you to do boring side quests for HOURS.

Recent Edit : Game still blows. Same issues.

Had a lot of fun playing this game. The female character has the better voice acting in my opinion. Game is massive as hell though so if you're looking to achievement hunt expect to spend at least like 120+ hours to achieve.

Okay so I decided to write this review ahead of time because of all the negative reviews popping up on steam lately.
I honestly don't know what to say. I expected the same microtransactions as Origins, and for it to be just as unnecessary for me, and I was correct. I didn't care and I never was tempted. I go onto Steam expecting a high rating, and no. This game deserves more I believe.

TLDR: This game is great. It has a few performance issues and hiccups, but this game is truly an amazing experience. Don't give up on this series just yet. It has only just found it's new legs. This game truly changed what AC was in the same way AC 2 did back when it was released. I can honestly say without a doubt that this is my favorite game in the franchise. Hands down.

LONG VERSION:

Firstly I'd like to get all the negative things mentioned out of the way.

1 - Optimization:
This game runs better on my PC than Origins does on the same build and settings. I believe they took the optimization problems from Origins, and improved upon it, but yes, there are times when it dips into the 30's on a GTX 1080Ti at 1080p. By no means is this good, but just the fact that there are no more stuttering cutscenes has already pushed this game beyond Origins in this field, IMHO.

2 - Microtrasactions:
Are there Microtransactions? Yes, there are. Are they necessary? NOO!! I have to say, after putting over 30+ hours into this game I have not felt pressured to use the Microtransactions, once! I guess it really is made for players to have a choice over how they want to play. If you want to get to the high levels of the map without completing side quests and exploring the MULTITUDE of different locations throughout the world, then good luck, cuz like any RPG this game is meant to build up your character and explore. You want a shortcut through that, you're gonna want Microtransactions. I, for one, by just following the story and exploring, have had no desire whatsover to pay for any Microtransactions. My character is constantly at a high enough level and I have 4000+ resources to use on upgrading gear, though I usually just use new gear as they come just because of how diverse and beautiful they are. They even made the Ship's most demanding piece of resource mostly available from naval combat.

3 - Side Missions:

This game's Side Missions are split into 3 main categories: Story Side Missions, Timed Side Missions, and Bounties. The Story Side Missions are incredible, Witcher 3 quality side missions, with decisions and consequences where one choice of mine actually affected an entire area in the game. The Timed Side Missions and Bounties are all timed missions where no story or choices are implemented. They're your basic go-there-get-that missions and they are for grinding (for those who prefer to do so). I completely ignore the notice board (where all the timed missions and bounties are) and I just do some of the timed missions that pop-up in the game world. It's more immersive, the grind is okay, and even some of the timed missions have a mini story (like a woman wanting me to deliver a witch some herbs so she would stop coming to their property naked at night to pick them while dancing naked because her husband likes to watch lol)

Now for the rest of this, guys.

4 - Story:
This is incredible so far. I'm having a blast and honestly it's so refreshing and new to have choices and dialogue options. I don't want to spoil anything so yeah. Love this game's story.

5 - Gameplay:
People keep saying it's a lot like Origins. There are similarities in my opinion, but this game has so many different abilities and skills that change the gameplay SOO MUCH! And if you loved Black Flag, well there's ton of ship combat here, but again, completely unique and suited to the setting and time period. I LOVE how this game handles combat and abilities, and I'm having a blast going through every location scattered around ancient Greece.

This game truly changed what AC was in the same way AC 2 did back when it was released. I can honestly say without a doubt that this is my favorite game in the franchise. Hands down.

The game is a screenshot simulator. The world in this game is absolutely beautiful. I've taken so many dang screenshots of locations I visited because everything is so pretty. If you're a fan of open-world RPGs like the Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption, and God of War, this game is worth your time if it's ON SALE - and I'll elaborate on that.

The biggest flaw in the game for me was that the writing was REAL average. It's not the best nor is it not the worst writing. It just gets by. The dialogue between your character and the minor/major characters aren't memorable at all. I finished this game + DLC a few days ago and I can only remember a handful of quests that really stood out to me. As a result of the pretty average writing, it's hard to get immersed in the incredible world because both of the main characters you can play have are bland and the quests you do in the world are uninteresting. This game is also 40-80 hours long of pretty much the same level of writing, depending on if you have the DLC at all. I will mention that the game starts off pretty strong, has a drawn-out mid-game, but a fantastic conclusion. (This is including the Fates of the Atlantis DLC, which is essentially the main story after you beat the non-DLC content)

Also, the animation/mocap during the scenes are actually somehow WORSE than the AC games that came before it. This was my first AC game but I looked at the opening scene in AC Unity (a game that came out 4 years before this one), and the animation has regressed somehow...

Not to mention that the combat is pretty average as well. When you think of good RPG combat you think of God of War and Dark Souls - the combat systems in those games are challenging but rewarding. AC Odyssey combat is pretty much the opposite. The enemies are "bullet" sponges and not intimidating whatsoever. You have abilities that heal significant amounts of your health on low cooldowns and even make you invulnerable for long periods of time. It was difficult for me to get into the combat because I never feared dying in an encounter - it was more a matter of just hitting the enemies with my abilities for a few minutes then doing whatever quest that brought me there. However, there are redeeming parts of the whole combat system. I did think that the large variety of gear and weapons was cool. There are so many ways to play - warrior (swords, maces, daggers, spears, axes, etc), assassin, and huntsman. Each has its own unique playstyle and do have the foundations of a solid RPG combat system.

Anyways, this game is decent. There are a lot of things to do in the massive world, but it could be better. 7/10 would recommend.

Great game, especially after Origins. The only fault I can mention for this game is being too long. It's so long that you get bored overwhelmed of playing and have to give breaks. If you are like me and can't play another game before completing the one you are playing, you will surely be bored overwhelmed of playing Odyssey. Took me 210 hours (I don't know why Steam counts 259h) to complete main game and all DLC's, get every collectible, complete every quest available, except a few achievements.
If you enjoyed Origins, you will enjoy Odyssey.
PS: Go for Kassandra.

Hello team ubisoft. I am a huge fan of assassin's creed franchise and ubisoft company. I am writing this review because i have many things to share about this game in my heart. First of all i completed assassin's creed odyssey yesterday and i really really liked the game 😍 when i played origins and came to this game at starting i was not satisfied because many gamers were criticizing and were saying that assassin's creed games are ruined at this point. But as i progressed in this game i really got addicted to this game and used to play all days when i used to get free time. Really this game map size is huge and we have freedom in this game. Currently i have played this game like 104 hours and completed odyssey quests and my pov while playing game was in happy ending. The graphics of this game is no doubt and characters of this game are just mind blowing. I am really really satisfied after completing the game and really happy now ☺. Once again ubisoft has made and master piece. I really want to thanks each and everyone who have made this game and specially to the actors of kasandra and alexios who are really talented guys 😘. Really appreciate ubisoft ❤ i recommend everyone to play this game and its really really amazing game. feeling sad because the game is now ended. Thank you if anyone is reading this review :)

This is a fantastic RPG.

Amazingly detailed open world.
A main story that doesn't get boring or feel like a chore.
Plenty of side quests that mix well with exploration.
Flexible combat styles and tactics.
Decent armor and weapon choices with a fashion mechanic so you can keep stats and look good.

However, this doesn't feel like an Assassin's Creed game, So I'm left wondering why include AC at all? This would of been an amazing stand alone game, so what if its built on the same engine. Frankly, I think Ubisoft should start letting some of these great ideas hold their own franchise instead of slowly diluting the AC universe.

Do not buy this game its been ruined by Ubisoft in the latest patch and there unsatiable greed.

Ubisoft increased the level limit twice making it 99 from 50. And then decreased xp gain. Pushing your towards there incame shop for boosters.

Ubisoft then reduced the amount of money you make from all sources, to push you towards the ingame shop for microtransactions.

Ubisoft also reduced how much materials you get from all sources, to push you towards there ingame shop for microtransactions.

Ubisoft deliberately degraded the player gaming experience to push microtransactions for greater profit.

Do not support Ubisoft by buying this game or any of there past or future games. Boycott Ubisoft and all gaming companies that deliberately impact player experience for profit.

This is a great example of a developer making an incredible game, but publisher and big studio decisions ruining it in favor of making more money.

I bought this game at launch and was instantly enthralled with the beautiful world they created. I played the main missions, side missions, and explored extensively. The setting, the protagonist, the gear, the combat (land and sea) was all the best I had ever experienced in an Action RPG. Despite what others said, I never had any issues with level walls and was able to reach max level (50) and complete the main story and many side missions in about 90 hours. I grinded to collect money and resources to upgrade all my legendary gear to level 50 so that I could 100% the game and start the DLC. Then the moneygrab happened...

Months after launch, the released a patch that reduced your damage, raised the max level to 70, reduced XP gains, and reduced the amount of resources you could collect. I tried to continue playing, but enemies kept outleveling me and I had no way to keep my favorite gear on par as I could not get enough resources to upgrade it every 5 levels. I knew they were pushing me to buy overpriced XP boosts or resource packs with real money, but I wouldn't give in. I played 30 more hours and only made it to level 60, dying to enemies leveled much higher than my gear several times in the process. Then they raised the level again to 99..

Again, I tried to continue leveling up, but I couldn't take one hit from level 65 enemies with my level 50 legendary gear. I had 3 options: use boring gear that I looted even though I collected legendary gear, use my level 50 legendary gear and dodge every attack, or spend hundred of dollars to boost my XP and resources to match my enemies. I chose to cheat instead. I used a mod in a single player game to level up myself and gear in order to avoid microtransactions that shouldn't exist.

TL;DR: AC: Odyssey had a chance to be the greatest ARPG every made, but was ruined by decisions to force people into buying XP boosts and resources through microtransactions. If you buy it, know there will come a point where you have to choose between a mod, 100 hours of grinding, or microtransactions to continue playing.

Never quite thought i would ever play another game that has such caliber as that of THE WITCHER 3: WILD HUNT. I delved 500+ hours into that game. I can say for sure this is an outright fantastic piece of work from Ubisoft. The archipelago, culture and citizens of greece down to the Greek Lore itself were all well implemented and referenced in its Assassin's Creed ways that i feel like as if i'm reliving the history itself.

COMBAT:
Love it since Origins and I LOVE it still. Definitely a huge lift off from the usual batman attack-parry combat from previous titles but hey, this new mechanic works and it works wonders
GAMEPLAY:
Full on RPG, down to skills, abilities to the weapons and armour sets. And let me tell you, I'm never a big fan of this genre, it all seems and feels so OVERWHELMING for me. The likes of The Division, Black Desert online, Warframe.. all amazing games yes but for me, they scare me with just how much time you need to invest and dedication to know which stats caters to which the best. And not to mention the strategic thinking process you need to create a gear "build", and dare I mention the sheer will and time you need to GRIND for these gear pieces. I just don't have time. Conclusion: If you're like me, just like things simplified, then this is the game FOR YOU
STORY:
The story yes of course. Some people dislike it, felt indifferent about it. But hey the story is what drives the game and let me tell you I ENJOY IT. The quests are a huge improvement from the go-from-pointA-to-pointB and the conventional fetch quest style. Expect nothing less if you compare it to the Witcher game. Where all quests have a purpose and story behind it as to why the situation or NPCs require your aid. Main story? Love it. Definitely one that I will remember.
REPLAYABILITY:
Where to even begin? Where to even see it end there're are just so much to do. I guess that's already enough said. Well, like all games even the witcher game still has an end where you truly exhausted all quests, contracts, hunts, bounties, scoured the whole map for all manner of types of gear and weapons. And by then.. your AC Odyssey would have already accumulated 300+ hours depending on your playstyle.

GAME OF THE YEAR FOR ME

Assassin Creed Odyssey AKA Assassin Creed Overload..so as usual great graphic, lots of things to do, and plenty of achievements. Now, this game is really extending the play time by including a lot of pointless quests and making resources harder than it needs to be to get for the upgrades. I have 200+ hours and level 88. Finished the main story and all the DLCs. I am not convinced that the tree system in this game is worth it. You have to get abilities in different categories so you can be more assassin, more warrior, or more hunter. Honestly, keep it simple. The more XP, the stronger I am and with better weapons, make more damage. I did enjoy playing the game but towards the end it became a drag to finish it. You walk around and clear a fort, see another question mark on the map...ooooh surprise another camp, and so on. There is no really feel of being either spartan or Athenian since you do not really have an incentive to conquer Greece for one side or the other (no achievement for that). So the battles for one side or the other become more meaningless other than getting resources and XP. For me, Origins strike a better balance and was more engaging. I would still recommend the game as performance were good on a FX8320 and GTX 1070 (2560x1080 Ultra Wide) but, be ready, you may get bored at one point and it will take some motivation to finish the game.

Step 1: Kill Athenians, loot drachme.
Step 2: Blame it on Spartans.
Step 3: Kill Spartans, loot drachme again.
Step 4: Blame it on Athenians.
Step 5: ???
Step 6: Profit.

Conclusion: 10/10 would play again.

Tried 3 day free trial and this game is soo much fun!. Odyssey is better in some places like overall combat, the cultist and mercenary systems, the skill tree, the customization compared to Origins. But i will say that its definitely not better than Origin, it doesn't even feel like an AC game but more like elder scrolls which is kind of a different approach.

By far the most beautiful game I've ever played. The Combat is simple but highly satisfying. I love the feel of the open world and exploration mode is so great. I realize now that that was probably what was killing the immersion for me in the last games and making me tire of them quickly... too many quest markers everywhere; this makes it feel like an adventure again and actually keeps things interesting because you have to actually explore. I'm glad I bought it it's worth every penny even at the ultimate price I have no regrets and over 50 hours played in only 4 days.

Quick Review:

Awesome game, not even close to The Witcher 3 but still great.

Long review:

Not grindy at all, maybe because I did not rush the main story.

I have played them all and this has nothing to do with Assassins Creed, only the name. Still the best in the "AC" franchise.

Buy only if you want an adventure not just rush into the story. If you are looking for an adventure this game is one of the best.

On release I read Odyssey was the same as Origin. After playing 90h I can tell you that is not the case.


- It is way better than Origin at everything unless the main core story.
- A lot of features and systems that keep the game alive.
- Awesome map.
- Improved and awesome combat.
- Great progression.
- Awesome inclusion of historical figures (as always in AC).

8,5/10

Ancient Greece is a wild and beautiful world. Greek history, as well as Greek mythology, has enormous potential - combining these two elements is certainly not an easy task, but Ubisoft has done its job perfectly.

For almost 240 hours.. it was an epic journey.. from the lost son of Sparta, who subsequently became a respected mercenary to the dreaded demigod strengthened by the abilities of the First Civilization (Isu).
However, the discovery of Greece is nothing compared to the mythical worlds we can look at and which are part of the DLC - the celestial Elysium, the chaotic Underworld and, of course, Atlantis itself.
I recommend keeping this DLC at the end of the game.

Personally, I was most fascinated by the meeting with Hades. I have not seen such an incredibly interesting character in the game for a long time - powerful, cruel, dreaded, funny and charismatic.

The improvement of the Assassin's Creed series with a higher intensity of sci-fi/fantasy elements fascinated me already in AC Origins, but AC Odyssey completely dominated me. I wish the creators adhered to this in future parts as well. 95%

I really have to give it to them for this title. This game is a blast to play. I've seen some players reporting crashes but the Devs must have fixed some of them as I've had maybe 3 or 4 CTDs in hundreds of hours playing. They try to tempt you with micro-transactions but all I spent were some of the reward credits I previously earned for a few items to get started with. You really don't need to, the game plays just fine as it is.

I also think the DLCs are really well done and not just a cash-grab as to me they're necessary to enjoy the intent of the story Guys, if you enjoy scenery, story, open world, humor and combat as most of us do, this game hits all the marks. Very few games are of this high caliber in so many categories. Also, you can choose to play the brother or the sister characters and both are totally enjoyable.

I've played all but one of the AC games, and while this game isn't typical of early AC games, it easily tops the list for me. This turned out to be one of my alltime favorite games, not just AC games, but all games. I cherish the time I spent playing Odyssey. It's a beautiful game and a memorable experience I will always remember. It's one of those rare games that after you complete it, you're grateful it was created but you regret you've already played it and don't still have it to look forward to. 10/10 for me.

this game is absolutely awful and an utter waste of time, the story was written by a moron, for morons, and don't even get me started on all the other aspects of the game, the combat and enemies are so shallow it's unheard of, the world is as empty as a hungry russian's stomach, and the gameplay is just lowest tier in general.. this franchise is beyond saving now and valhalla proves it, please don't play

won't change recommendation status due to ratings, I want people to see this

Grinding has never felt better...

I'm someone who has never been interested in Assassin's Creed games. Not even Black Flag (I hear that's one of the better AC games?) was able to hook me in, nevertheless, I bought Odyssey because of the new dialogue system they've added to the game and I'm glad I did. Been really enjoying it, combat is not all that different from Origins but the world is more beautiful, Kassandra as a protagonist is awesome and the side quests, although very bland at some points, are actually interesting. The setting of the game also played a crucial role. I'm simply fascinated by Greek mythology and it was really satisfying to see and actually fight some of those mythologies in this game.

It goes on pretty good sales and pretty often, get it on a sale and enjoy at least 100 hours of content for a cheap price. (Gold edition is the way to go by the way.)

Playing this after spending 88 hours on Valhalla. And I wish to take those Valhalla hours back. If you want a good AC game this is the one.

This game is amazaing.

Simple Review.
If you like the sailing and sea combat of Black flag and the RPG gameplay style of Origins. Well then you are in luck because they bumped uglies and this was their offspring. The map is huge. The Greek Lore is amazing. Just wait until you get to Athens. The Explore style option for gameplay is great.
10/10
I cant wait to see how the constant content release plays out.

Update:
Currently have almost 90hrs on this game. only 50% of the map is uncovered and level 44. I have no idea how far along i am on the story. This game is totally worth full price. I would even encourage you to get the Season Pass. Odyssey is a fitting name as this game is turning into an odyssey. It reminds me of fallout/skyrim roaming from ? to ? to see what i find. The story has actually been really good up to the point i am at.

Most of the Bad reviews deal with micro transactions. They are mostly cosmedic "like an entire ship crew of female assassians" or "different colors for your ship sails" but no added damage or bonus other then looks. if that really offends you that much then i suppose you should pass on this.

Assassin's creed Odyssey is simply more Assassin's creed Origins. If you liked Origins then you will like Odyssey as well. If you read my Origins review then you will see that I enjoyed Origins very much. Unfortunately I can no longer advocate for games like this that intentionally remove or modify content then try to sell it back as separate microtransactions for the sole purpose of making more money. And with the recent news that XP boost and other microtransactions have been added back into assassin's creed Valhalla a month after its initial launch (conveniently giving just enough time for critic reviews to be completed and for everyone to buy copies for Christmas) it is clear that Ubisoft can no longer be trusted to act in the best interest of their playerbase.

A lot of people have graphical issues for this and Origins. I too was one of them, it barely run at 60fps on high and then would dip to 40fps in busy urban areas. I found a solution by tweaking some options in the display menu however and now i play at a consistant 61fps on high, even in busy environments on a fairly modest machine.

1) Set anti aliasing to adaptive with target frame rate at 60fps. This will automatically disable v-sync.
2) Set maximum frame rate to 60fps.

For me, this fixed my performance issues for both this and origins. It plays on a consistent 61fps at the high setting. I'm using a gtx 1060 (6gb) and an i7 4790.

I haven't played enough of this game as of yet, so my views are subject to change after I dig in deeper into it. So far, my first impression over Origins, a game which I deeply enjoyed playing, is of both joy and disappointment.

The joyous part:

- better graphic quality
- the portrayal of the Ancient Greek world is as good, or even better than the Ancient Egyptian one
- the naval battles and exploration is a huge plus, one of the few things I felt was missing from Origins
- better soundtrack
- the main characters are more in-depth, have more substance and MC interactions with NPCs is more organic
- better story and character development
- more variety in terms of combat skills

As for the cons, they are not as many as the pros, but they are a bit disappointing and discouraging from playing the game. My main complaint is about the insane level of grinding required to gain money and resources, without opting for microtransactions. Sure, Origins had microtransactions too, and there was a moderate amount of grinding involved too (mostly for resources, less for money). But the grinding in Origins had a point, encouraging you to explore the map and gain as many resources as possible so that you can upgrade your equipment. Here, grinding is more about farming/spam locations for money and resources, not to mention that the amounts required to upgrade your EQ and ship is enormous.

For people with a lot of time in their hands, this might not be a problem. For those who like the game but time is not on their side, it becomes obvious that the game was made having greed in mind as progressing through it becomes a chore. This subtly forces you to 'cheat' your way with buying resource or money packs. This is certainly not the kind of business model I agree on. In Origins, I only had to spend the credits that the gold edition of the game gave me and nothing else. But here, the credits won't help that much. They are few, and the resources they can provide are small compared to the amount upgrades will require.

In all honesty, I like the game. I like its story, I like its characters, I like the mechanics. I enjoy taking the ship and smashing through enemy ships. I enjoy some combat and the good old stealthy assassination. But this insane amount of grinding required to progress is very off-putting. As such, I am left with a love-hate sentiment. On one hand I love the game and want to play as much of it as possible and enjoy some badass combat. On the other hand, you have this enormous grinding ahead which is discouraging if you want to avoid microtransactions. I know there are ways to make money and resources, but all of them requires farming, doing a lot of contracts, spamming forts, sinking ships, etc.

Even worse is the fact that, if you don't buy permanent exp/money boost, the game gets even more grindy. The main quest does not provide enough exp so that you can advance it without doing side quests to gain the recommended level.

For now, I do recommend the game, but with a pretty big disclaimer in front.

Here goes: the last review for the last Assassin’s Creed to be released on Steam. If we’ll see ever see Valhalla on Steam I’ll post a review for it, but for now this will be the last one. I might review the three Chronicles games someday, though, but they just weren’t as fun.

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey starts the cycle of Assassin’s Creed games anew by adding some new features that make the whole package more complete, but not in a revolutionary way:
Like Syndicate you now also have the choice between two playable characters, Kassandra and Alexios, with Kassandra clearly being the better choice (but I might be a bit biased here).
The world seems to have more variety now, with more types of biomes. I’m all for this of course, the world of Origins was at times a little same-y.
Love is in the air this time (or at least it can be) with the new ability to woo someone (romantic options). Never a bad choice to have in your RPG.
The skills that can be unlocked are a little less varied this time. Unlocking better versions of already unlocked skills is boring. You want new stuff. A frustrating choice and I’m not sure why they went with this over the more diverse skill tree of Origins.
The Mercenary system is a fun addition, but it’s merciless with sometimes a continuous stream of appearing mercenaries to fight off. Fortunately there’s an option to pay these bounty hunters off, resetting the entire bounty (which builds up depending on your actions).
Other than that there once again have been tweaks to improve the game, and some smaller new features.
Finishing the game completely will take you way over 150 hours, and just the story should take around 50 hours depending on your playstyle.

Graphically there hasn’t been much progress in comparison to Origins. Again, it uses a lot of bright environments and settings, which I love, and everything is detailed and sharp.
There are performance issues, just like Origins (since it uses the same engine), but as far as I know these also haven’t been fixed.
Like we’ve come to expect from the franchise the voice acting, sounds and music are of consistently high quality. No surprises here.

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey improves upon Origins, and that’s just the way the franchise works with every new game until they eventually press the reset button. I might seem negative, but between Origins and Odyssey this one is clearly the best (and the most complete). It’s a solid RPG that definitely can still be improved upon, but as it stands now it’s guaranteed to last you many, many fun and action filled hours.

Ubisoft really wasn't joking around when it called the latest Assassin's Creed game an Odyssey. It's not just in the Greek tragedy-inspired story, the vast, vast map or the sheer number of hours you're going to sink into it. It's the journey. The journey from one Greek island to another, with dolphins and whales cresting the waves alongside your boat. It's about the journey across the stunning Grecian landscape, it's also about the journey to discover who exactly you are in Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

First game in the Assassin's creed franchise to feature complete RPG elements and dialogue choices.
(play Assassin's creed origins first to understand the lore)

RATINGS-8.5/10!

PERFORMANCE- This game is optimised well in some sense. Game is CPU bottlenecked most of the time and stutters here
and there. Make sure to follow Hardware unboxed's optimised settings to make game run smoother.

STORY- ---------*Set during Spartan era where you get to play either Kassandra or Alexios. Both characters are canon and
only minute changes happen to the story based on your choice.
*Main missions are kinda long and time consuming and I took almost 70 hours just to finish the main
campaign.The DLC's are really good and each one take between 10-12 hours to complete.

PROS-----------*Melee animations are fluid and offer a vast majority of takedown abilities.
*Leveling system is back in this title, and u can reach upto level 100 but it is highly impossible to reach on
first play-through.
*Naval combat feels really smooth and fluid in this game unlike Black flag.

CONS-----------*The side missions are repetitive and don't normally add much to the main story.
*The horse animations suck and whenever you are detected by the enemy the horse just slows down
which is so irritating!
*Map is huge! Entire map is riddled with collectibles.
*Dialogue choices has a huge impact to the story so quick save every 5-10 minutes by pressing F5.

I absolutely loved Origins, and I love this (so far) even more. Sure, it's very similar to Origins on the surface, but once you get into it, it's a much more personal game, giving you the ability to make your own decisions (to an extent), but we'll see how much those actually impact the game later on ;)

I spent two-three hours alone on the first island exploring the beauty of it, and simply adjusting to the combat. The fact that you can have special abilities is completely new to this series (as is a lot of other things). I see what people mean: this is very similar to an RPG.

The world is massive, and it feels limitless! It's amazing. Not to mention they took the ship mechanic of Black Flag and added it here, but it feels more realstic, ESPECIALLY when you board a ship. Instead of having the little cutscene in Black Flag, it sinks immidiately after you kill everyone, and you have just enough time to loot and then get back to the ship before it sinks under your feet. It's honestly awesome.

You will need to watch out for your level... similarly to the last game, the bounty hunters are back, and they're as strong as ever, except they're a lot cooler with special attributes (from what I've seen). I couldn't think about taking on the first hunter until I was level 4, and even then I was still nearly beaten. The level recomndations were real in Origins, but here they're even truer to their word.



This game is amazing... to me. If you hate long grinds, don't like spending amounts of time leveling up through "meaningless side-quests" etc., and if you hate where Origins took the franchise, avoid this game. Otherwise... I completely recommend it.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an Open World Action RPG that continues the trend of started by AC Origins, this game on its own is quite different from Origins as it tries to do a few things differently-

As for a summary, I have completed the main storyline, took down all the cultists, completed the Atlantis side quests (the one with mythical beasts), the first DLC and all its order of the ancients and also the 2nd DLC, I'm at 99% progression according to ubisoft connect.
TLDR: This game is a solid addition to the franchise and an overall 9/10 (this is the score only for the base game), the first DLC is 7/10 and the 2nd one is 7.5/10. I played the gold edition so i did not have access to any sort of xp boosts either. There's also a bunch of side quests called the Lost Tales of Greece which is a 6/10.

Now for the Pros- Ancient Greece looks stunning, there's so much attention to details, each main city has different feel to it, The map is huge and although most of it is forest and water, it has enough mechanics going on for itself to make it all engaging and immersive. The main story of the game is also really good and pretty engaging, you would end up caring for a few characters which is rare in an AC game. Now the game has choices, which tbh don't really matter, they're just different dialogue options but a few of them actually change your story and how certain parts of the world would be. The Naval combat is awesome, you can customize your ship, assign lieutenants, it isn't as great as blag flag since here you only have arrows and javelins, but overall works well to hold itself. The customization options for your character are also really well done. Each side quest in this have a whole story related to it, although they're mostly fetch quests, the presence of a story provides enough immersion. The mercenary system was extremely fun, since each of these mercenaries are almost like their own boss fight and pretty tough if 3 or 4 of them attack you at once, it made me more focused on stealth so that I wouldn't get a bounty on my head, now for the stealth, it works well for this time in history, social stealth is gone which wouldn't really work in this settings since not a lot of people roam in here, The combat is also really fun, the different abilities we have in this game makes every encounter different, you can also reassign your skill points to have a different style of play, however once you've figured out everything, you're basically a force of the nature and then the combat can get a tad bit repetitive which I'd say is fine considering you'd have to spend atleast 50 hours in the game just for the main story. There are different weapons, each of them feels different to each other and can again make the combat a lot engaging and fun. The mythical beasts are also well done and fell different to each other, each of them are challenging and add variety to the game, The game also has different tombs to raid to get loot and ability points. The motion capture and voice acting overall is also well done.

Now for the Cons- The world is huge and empty, this game could've really benefited from the random encounters and events like the ones present in Red Dead 2, the only thing that would happen is either a random camp with bandits or soldier, or some animals roaming around, The conquest battles are awesome and a lot of fun but they have no depth at all, it doesn't matter if Athens wins or Sparta, your story will still be same, This game is not an Assassin's Creed game, and I'm not saying this because of the RPG elements, I think the RPG stuff only makes it better for me, but the thing is there are no assassins or templars, this is more like a God of War game if Kratos was an okayish character, On the topic of character, Alexios or Kassandra are okay as a protagonist but not really good as compared to someone like Bayek or Ezio. The game also has level differences which means you'd have to do side quests to level up, although it isnt really a as big of a problem as some Youtubers might say, since you can pretty much get around it by just accepting all the quests from an area and you'd automatically complete them by stumbling on to whatever the side quest giver wanted. The game also has Microtransactions which aren't exactly forced at you but even their presence is an ugly sight in a really good looking game

Now there are some things that were present in the earlier games but have been removed in odyssey due to some reason, firstly the shield, although i never missed it, it could've been cool and also literally everyone has a shield except you in the game, Next are the different bow types, now i know they included it in the form of abilities but i feel those different bows could've been a great addition.

Now for the Lost Tales of Greece- This is free content that all the players who own any edition of the game will get. They are a bunch of side quests involving people you've met in the main story but the gameplay is random as its just a bunch of fetch quests, not very exciting.

Now for the 1st DLC- This is pretty much the same game, it adds a few abilities which are fun I guess, the story is super random and the characters are again okayish, It adds a flamethrower to your ship which is awesome and gives some backstory on a few characters from the broader AC lore.

Now for the 2nd DLC- The 3 different realms of this dlc are really good looking, the story is also not that bad, but its just an insane amount of meaningless filler content that brings down the dlc, again it adds a few abilities and there are a few variations to the normal gameplay loop

Now in the Season Pass- You'd get both the DLC and also Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered and Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered, each of them are good games with a score of 8.5/10 and 7/10 in my opinion.

I'd recommend getting the gold edition or the season pass just for the amount of content it gives, maybe wait for a sale to get this game since it goes on a 70% discount every now and then. I don't recommend the deluxe or ultimate edition since the extra gear you get is pretty bad and you'd get better rewards from the Ubisoft Club for free

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the best Assassin's Creed Game since Black Flag. Its fun, engaging and beautiful. It improves upon its predecessor Origins in every way, ditching bad aspects of that game for improvements in all the good stuff, and even adding some popular mechanics from older games, such as the bounty system from Black Flag! However, some annoying features from Origins did make it though, such as the levelling and mission system, although the side missions now reward much better items and the reasons for doing them are now much better. Visuals received a slight upgrade from Origins, although this game is much better optimised for PC.
The Story features you playing as either Kassandra or Alexios of Sparta, as you their adventure across ancient Greece. Along the way you discover your past and end disputes and issues in the present. This game has different endings where your decisions decide who survives until the end of the game, so be careful about what you say! The Story is very good and always makes you wanting to play the next mission, which however isn't always possible as the level gap will force you to play side missions, the same issue that Origins had, although these side missions are much better.
The Gameplay is much better than origins, with blocking being improved, attack abilities added and generally combat feels much smoother. It is now possible to single-handedly kill an entire army again just like in the classic Assassin's Creed Games. Joy. Weapons are largely the same, with the main difference being you don't have a hidden blade, it's instead a small spear? You no longer upgrade your armour, you instead loot and get new armour and outfits across Greece which is much better than having to hunt. Finally, Boat combat is back! And it is a lot of fun! The bounty system is also back but it feels flawed as sometimes attacking a fort as part of a quest becomes impossible as bounty hunters way above your level will stop you from doing anything.
Visuals are beautiful. Oceans, Fields, Cities and Islands are all beautiful and the team at Ubisoft really managed to capture the beauty of Greece. Especially with the Islands!
Overall, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is one of the best instalments of the series so far, as it is fun, has an epic story and has beautiful visuals. It runs well and no game-breaking bugs are present so its actually a very good game! Combat can be a bit annoying sometimes as the lock on system will have a mental breakdown during large combats (such as the nation wars) as it cant decide who you want to attack next, only for you to get bamboozled by someone you cant even see. But overall, great game.
Assassin's Creed Odyssey gets an 8/10.

**1.0.3 UPDATE BELOW**

AC Odyssey is massive. There really isn't a better way to describe it. It feels as if Far Cry 5 and AC Origins had a baby that only inherited the better parts of each, with a little bit of their cousin, Shadow of Mordor, thrown in for good measure.

Pros:
+ It's beautiful, vibrant, and huge.
+ All of the RPG Elements from Progression to Gear
+ Likeable Characters (NPCs and Kassandra/Alexios)
+ Branching Story/Choices
+ Character Customization
+ Breathtaking and Immersive locations
+ The Peloponnesian War
+ Endless Amount of Stuff to do
+ Engaging Combat
+ CONQUESTS
+ Photo Mode
+ Historical Locations
+ Very Free and Open World
+ Not as Buggy as Previous titles at Release
+ Large Variety of Weapons/Cosmetics
+ Runs Relatively Well considering its scope
+ Ship Combat is similar to Black Flag's
+ Tons of ways to play (Guided/Exploration Mode with Multiple Difficulties, Character Choice)

Cons:
- Some Bugs, but nothing gamebreaking for me quite yet
- Frame drops when near fire/level streaming kicks in (FPS drops is a listed issue on their site, so hopefully
it won't be around forever).
- Needs Optimization


**UPDATE 1.03**
1.03 added some nice additions such as a storage chest on your ship. It's very handy for storing gear you want to upgrade later. Additionally, there were tons of fixes/stability improvements. Performance seems to have slightly increased in some areas of the game. All in all, solid patch, long update notes list, and neat new features. Can't wait to see what's next.

**UPDATE 1.05**
Since 1.03, there really haven't been any major changes that affect my personal experience quite yet. Still having a blast!

185 hours and I'm officially out of quests (not counting bounty boards). Phew what a ride!

What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said... Well first off, I'm not an Assassin's Creed fan, and I"m not a Ubisoft fan. I picked this game up during a very generous sale, right after I was done with CP 2077. Boy was I in for a treat. I thought CP2077 was going to scratch that Witcher 3 itch, but it turned out that Odyssey was the winner

So what's so great about this game? pretty much everything. The game world is breathtaking, the physics are on point, voice acting is excellent, combat is fun, challenging and engaging. Customization is done just right, with distinct classes that can be blended or played individually and gear that offers so many different ways to specialize your combat. Graphics are also quite excellent, I'm particularly impressed with facial expressions. Both expansions were great, especially at the sale price.

This game is easily 10/10

As for Ubisoft... I am still not impressed with their monetization department. Games are still overpriced at launch. Forcing people to use their horrendous launcher is really frustrating, with its incessant disconnects and sync issues. And of course, their latest and greatest move - keep new titles out of Steam... When will they learn.

I have a love hate relationship with Ubisoft.
I've been playing the Assassins Creed series for quite a while now. They have kept the gameplay pretty consistent throughout the years. Depending on who you ask, it has been both a blessing and a curse.

In my opinion, Ubisoft's lack of innovation started to go downhill ever since Assassin's Creed Black Flag. This led me to turn away from the franchise for a while, seeking different genres and styles, hoping that they will eventually come back with something new and exciting... and so ladies and gentlemen, they finally have.

At first glance, Assassin's Creed Odyssey may not seem all that different from previous releases. Once you play it, you will find that it takes the old gameplay, combines, and transforms it in a very different and satisfying way. Old gameplay mechanics can be felt, but Odyssey introduces a few twists in combat, progression, and especially a well needed turn in quests and story telling.

I'm trying to keep my review relatively short and sweet so I will not go over every change and detail, but know this.

Strong graphics, satisfying combat, addicting progression, and captivating storytelling, if you love and seek these elements in your everyday games, then Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a must play.

Easily the best assassin's creed game in the franchise. But it's from Ubisoft so expect some Ubisoft special features like an ingame store filled with micro transaction. They've designed the game in such a way that you'll have to grind your way only to play the main missions or pay 10usd for a permanent xp boost. And you grind by playing countless amount of sh*tty sidequests which are not fun whatsoever. The story and the missions are great but good luck grinding.

This game is worth at full price but needs optimization as the game is notorious to lag in the cities.

PSA: Don't buy anything from the in-game store.

I started playing video games about 6 years ago for the first time. I'd consider myself a very casual gamer. The story, open world, and gameplay of this game are extremely enjoyable to me, and even though there were several fights I had to have my husband get through for me, I would 100% recommend this game to anyone.

i've been an assassin's creed fan since i was very little, i used to play for hours day and night
played all of the games in the series and loved most of them.
but after syndicate i didn't see the assassin's creed i knew.
the price of them were too much for me bcs games are much more expensive in my country.
until this game released and i'm hating myself for not playing it when it came out,
but 2 weeks ago i downloaded a cracked version of the game(i'm sorry)
i played the game, i enjoyed it more and more as i was going more deep into the game.
i was dying of enjoyment and decided that i have to buy it bcs it's the best game in the series so far,
i waited for the sales bcs it was too expensive for me, then the sales started.

and here i am writing a review for the best game i've ever played in my life and thank u ubisoft for this great game :)
have a great life <3

it's the kind of game you play without a break for a while and then just drop it out of the blue, only to come back to it a few months later. The generic checklist gameplay of go to a certain spot and finish certain number of objectives should, on paper, get old really fast. Yet, the game world keeps the locales varied and the enemies interesting enough to mitigate the otherwise dull task of doing ticking things off a checklist on a map that is seemingly as big as IRL Greece itself.

Going into this game blind is perhaps the best way to get the full experience of this game. When you accidentally start a quest chain that leads to amazing views and unbelievable fights, those memories stick with you. It also helps that Kassandra is a compelling character, powered by fantastic voice acting, and a strong personality that makes you want to be her friend.

The game is not without its faults, it can get tedious every now and then, but then all you have to do is go on a sight seeing tour or sail the high seas, and you are ready to resume your journey.

There are negative's to this game, it has been on the market for a couple years so i do not feel the need to list them out here. However to my mind the good far outweighs the bad. The combat is simple while not seeming too simple. The world is vast and rewards exploration.

There are multiple ways to play in terms of weapons, skill and gear selections. If you have time to explore the world and delve deep into the world this is as rewarding as Witcher 3. If you prefer to simply go from main quest to main quest locations then this game will not be as great.

The protagonists you can select are well voice acted with Kassandra being excellently well done.

If you like RPG's, if you like Greek Mythology, then you should love this game.

Can't say for the general classic AC games but this one is a good game RPG wise.
Stunning graphics, good combat & stealth system (better than Origins imo), cool engravings & a bit of engaging philosophical conversation.
Story is linear with very little to no impact from the choices you can make but it's not too bad, average at best I suppose.

Definitely a recommended game with the largest map for an AC and so many things you can do.

Compared to "Origins" the game-world is even more beautiful and combat is even more powerful. But "Origins" is the better story and Bayek the better protagonist. Fantastic game nevertheless, especially in terms of the "maritime" atmosphere, character design and boss-monsters.

Thankfully, the "Abstergo" nonsense has been (again) reduced to a minimum.

As a longtime fan of Assassin's Creed, I really enjoyed Odyssey. After 70 hours of exploring, fighting, upgrading, sailing, hunting and looting, I still have so many sites to see. The world of Ancient Greece is full of gorgeous cities and landscapes. The sheer size of the map still impresses me. It's one of the best open-world games I've played.

This game is MASSIVE and it is actually better than AC: Origin which was also fantastic gameplay wise but man does it hurt seeing how overboard they have gone with microtransactions, I payed 120$ and still feel like I need to spend at least another 50$ to truly enjoy this game the way it was meant to be played by the devs, the game is not balanced to be best enjoyed without buying "time savers" and no matter how amazing the game is, this is going to be the death of AC as a series if they don't ease off on the extreme level of greed on display at every turn in this game.

This game is far from being bad, it is a great game but it constantly pushes you toward spending money. Upgrading items costs resources, upgrading your ship costs resources and at no time does it ever feel good to be in a shop looking at your choices when you know that this choice wouldn't exist if you payed more money. Being able to pay for something undermines any purpose the resources have by boiling them all down to "you could farm this stuff but we would really rather you just pay us more" because no matter how much they give you during play you still know that it was all put into the game with the intent of giving you something you could spend real money on. If you couldn't buy them then it would make said resources and levels you gain feel purposful, if you ever want to prove this point to yourself simply imagine your favorite games with a similar cash store being added in, imagine any final fantasy game where you could buy EXP or cash boosts, imagine Pacman if you could get a 2xpoints boost for 1.99$ and how that would literally make everything you do feel undermined.

There really needs to be a better review system on here like a numerical rating or a neutral thumbs up/down. I'm kinda in between with this one so I guess I'll put a thumbs down so more people will see it. A lot of the positive reviews here come from peopple very early off in the game and it's understandable since it starts off very strong. If I were rate the first 10 or so hours spent playing, I'd give it at least a 9/10. The story and RPG elements are awesome and even though a lot of people say Odyssey is a copy and paste of past Assassin's Creed games, I think they definitely stepped it up with Odyssey. The choice makin, gameplay, and story are a huge step up. But after the first 10 or so hours, the game comes to almost an instant stop. The story begins to go beyond slow and it starts to become filled with filler missions and things to just extend the game. The main story quests start to require a level limit so you need to do a bunch of side stuff just to continue the story UNLESS you purchase Ubisoft's XP micro transactions to speed up the game basically allowing you to pay Ubisoft to beat the game for you. This game is just WAY too long. I don't know why Ubisoft makes these way longer than they need to be other than to just sell their micro transactions. It'd be a 10/10 in my book if they focused less on the length and more on the quality that was seen at the beginning of Odyssey.

After destroying a fleet in your ship and traveling most of the Greek world you will remember what an awe inspiring adventure is.

The story might be a simple family tragedy, but it can keep you interested enough to think and rethink the choices you make and the characters you save.

I've played all of the Altair/Ezio/Desmond games and even though I really liked them, I understand that they ended and more and different stories will be told with the assassin's weird first civilization lore, part of the appeal of those games was not knowing what the answers were, so if you are looking for nostalgia for Assassin's Creed you are not going to relive what being an assassin feels like again, with so many answers to what the Isu are and their purpose that sense of wonder is not coming back.

But if you want an Odyssey that expands through years in the life of a character with both meaningful and trivial consequences to your actions and a really rich world with an impressive detail and great combat, this is the place.

PS: I never bought a micro-transaction and I was able to find enough xp, money and epic gear, the game is not a grinding fest. You should get the DLC though, the content is great and there are usually some sales for the more pricy editions.

Good game, decent story, Great experience. Assassins Creed Odyssey will fill anyone who craves a thrilling action RPG with decent combat. AC: Odyssey combat reminds me of a mixture of Dragon age Inquisition, Legend of Zelda breath of Wild and Witcher 3. The game takes on all aspects of open world and smashes it up into a very good game. I enjoyed what the game offer and so will anyone who choose to get this game. Make sure you do not attempt to rush through this game or you'll miss out on the experience. Its good.

The amount of Micro-Transactions in this game is absurd, especially with the "Reveal all locartions on the map" DLC.
>Lmao just don't buy it xD
The fact of the matter is that if there is a staggering amount of DLC within the first week of release, the game has cut content being placed behind a paywall. This is not excusable.

Gameplay is fine, you quickly get used to the controls in my opinion.

The concept of "Leveled Areas" is stupid if all areas level with the player. Why have leveled areas to begin with then?

The game is NOT historically accurate, so bear that in mind if you are one of those people who points out historical stuff constantly. Consider it an alternate reality, especially since your fighting Medusa and there are digital gods.

Graphically, the game fine enough. I am playing on Ultra settings and I have seen clipping issues with my armor, specifcally some vambraces and texture quality of npc armor looks like it was made out of butter.

Overall, the game is not bad. I will continue to not reccomend it however as long as Ubisoft continues to shove hordes of micro transactions in every possible area.

Also Uplay is the bane of mankind, please just acknowledge everyone hates it and bury it.

Go for this game if you have long vacation or just nothing to do. This game will entertain you for a long time. So many quests, so many places to discover.

Malaka! How I hate boars and hostile chickens in this game.

This game right here is an absolute masterpiece! Everything single thing about it is great and it's filled with loads and loads of things to keep you busy even after you finished the story. I recommend this to anyone that likes video games, it's a must play!

I can understand why fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise are a bit disappointed in this title, as it greatly differs from the original games, but it is still a fantastic game. It still fits in the overall AC Lore but it is much more RPG oriented - which to be honest isn't a bad thing.

Lots of customization, huge world, GREEK SETTING! With historical landmarks or historical figures finding their way into the game...

This game is incredible. As an Assassin's Creed game, it is very different, but that's not a negative. As an action-adventure game, it is fantastic.

Absolutely recommend.

Is Assassin's Creed Odyssey Better Than The Witcher 3?

Short Answer: No.
Witcher 3 has much extensive RPG mechanics, characters that bring out more emotional attachment, and better side quests among many other aspects that Odyssey cannot match. But the fact that AC Odyssey is even in the conversation with Witcher 3 is quite an accomplishment for Ubisoft and definitely a journey worth experiencing.

Ubisoft has taken what they introduced in Origins and improved it in every way from character development to combat system/RPG elements, and more comprehensive side quests in a much bigger open world environment.



While playing Odyssey I saw glimpses of the Witcher 3’s influence.
The rich dialogue and interactions you have with the world and the NPC’s (Non-playable Characters) allows you to feel attached to them, like I did with Geralt in the Witcher…that is if you play as Kassandra. She is quick witted, funny and passionate. It's nice that Ubisoft gives you the option to play as multiple characters, but to be honest you will enjoy Odyssey much more with Kassandra. Alexios voice acting is quite bad because it's often over the top, forced and feels like a bad B or C level actor voiced him, pulling you out of meaningful moments in the game. With Kassandra though I never had that experience. Also, Ubisoft pulled back the confusing story-line of the series a bit so that you’re not weighted down with the relationship the Assassins have with the Templar’s as much as previous games. This makes me more invested and excited for the story than I have been in games prior to Origins


The combat system is very similar to the Witcher 3 but not as robust.

You’re able to freely spend and reset your ability points, trying different combinations of weapons and attacks. You want flaming dual swords? Check. How about remote control over an arrow for perfect shot placement? Check. Rage mode like God of War? Check. My personal favorite has to be the Spartan Kick. I find myself yelling “THIS IS SPARTA” in my head every time I do it. This variety and flexibility will drive you to unlock more and more abilities.

On top of the abilities of the characters, customization with your weapons is great too. You’re able to get different level of gear off enemies along the rank of common, rare, epic, and legendary. Each piece has different perks so you’re able to match them to your style of play and you can even add additional ones to your gear by engraving. Such enhancements are additional critical damage, stealth bonus, faster ability recharge, breathing under water, etc… And if you have a level one piece of gear that you really like, you can raise it to the max level if you have the necessary crafting materials.


Which game does weapons and abilities better?

That’s up to your personal preference. I think that most people will like Odyssey more than Witcher 3 in this regard even though the latter has more to choose from. Mostly because you only get one reset on your abilities for the game on the Witcher 3, so you have to choose your points wisely as they will hold a lot more weight as you progress.


Side Missions
In many open world games, you could stick to the main quest almost start to finish without feeling that you’re missing out on an epic side mission. Not the case with Odyssey though. Much like Witcher 3, Odyssey is able to pull me in with the many side quests. I found myself with very little regrets going out of my way to a spot with a “?” and spending the time to complete it. Though I still haven’t come across a side quest as memorable as The Bloody Barron in Witcher 3, which is probably an unfair comparison as that side quest is one of the best ever in gaming history. Odyssey’s side quests are meaningful though. The fetch quests, as there are many in massive open world game, are even enjoyable. For example, one of my favourite fetch quest was a love triangle where you have to collect items to make a potion that will cause someone to fall in love with an NPC. You can choose different options which effect how it unfolds and who end up with the “happy ending”. It is these kind of details that make your time spent doing extra content satisfying. Even as I was playing the other night I was flagged down by an NPC. I thought “Okay, this should be a 10 minute pit stop for some of that sweet, sweet XP.” Wrong! Two hours later I finished the multiple branching side quest with a thrilling conclusion. Every time I think, I’m going to work on the main story I get distracted by one of the many “?” on the gigantic map. To some this may seem overwhelming (and it is), but it’s an example of how good content all around helps drive people to play your game.

Final Thoughts
My final thoughts on this game and the comparison is that these type of games are best played and enjoyed at your own pace, not thinking about how you’re going to 100% it or beat it fast. I’m the type of gamer that wants to burn through games, but after a few hours in the world of Odyssey I stopped trying to rush to the end and just started to enjoy the ride.

The game is fairly enjoyable, but Ubisoft's monitization scheme is unforgivable. They intentionally make the game give you less money and less xp than you need to progress smoothly, then try to sell money and xp boosts for real money as "time savers." It's despicable. While the problem can be avoided by modding the game, just don't give Ubisoft your money. Also, the story seems promising at first, but doesn't deliver in the long term. Near the end, it doesn't escalate much in terms of story and gameplay, so it feels like it ends suddenly and inconclusively. The game also gives you the feeling that your choices don't matter, usually by making your attempts to avoid killing people resulting in you having to kill them anyways. It feels like the writers want to force one outcome, regardless of your choices. The problems in the story aren't apparent until after playing for tens of hours, so don't waste your time.

I could literally spend 200+ hours playing in this awesome open world game. The missions and side missions are awesome and very challenging. The scenery in the game is beautiful and breath-taking. I highly recommend this game for ANYONE who loves Greek Mythology, Assassins, or any type of open world games.

IF YOU'RE ON THE FENCE ABOUT BUYING THIS GAME, no one blames you.

Any series into the habit of annual releases deserves a ton of speculation, and no one who's played the first couple AC's can honestly say that the last few games have been very... well, good. I felt the same way about Odyssey before buying it. LISTEN TO MY WORDS: THIS IS A GOOD GAME. At the time of this post, I've been playing for ~30 hours, and there's never been a point at which I felt like I was out of things to do. The storyline alone has taken up the majority of my playtime, and I'm not anywhere near the end. I'm not a fan of games that make you grind for hours and hours on end to balance out the skill/gear requirements, and this game does a good job of making your progression feel natural and well-earned, particularly when you're playing on Hard difficulty, when enemies are always on their game.

I saw a few posts before I bought this saying that stealth wasn't a big factor in this game, and that worried me, because I've been a huge fan of the stealth aspects of the series. After playing this long, I would be willing to bet a good deal of V-Bucks that anyone who thinks stealth isn't needed in this game is playing on Easy difficulty. I've been playing it on Hard, and the majority of the time that I've felt the need to charge into an enemy fortress, I've had my ass handed to me. Stealth is the ONLY way to clear out the majority of encampments, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

I also saw a lot of people complaining about the naval mechanics, saying that it's "dulled down" since Black Flag. Well, obviously. There's no way to make a volley of arrows feel as meaty as a dozen cannons. Get over it, I guess. That being said, I've tried going back and playing Black Flag to focus on the sailing, but I can't. The combat in Odyssey is my favorite in the series so far, and so I can handle a more relaxed naval combat system in return for everything else that this game does in terms of gameplay.

I've always been a fan of the series. I left for a while when they started releasing every year, but I'm glad I came back for this. Easily my favorite in the series, I would give this game a solid 8.7/10.

If you can enjoy Witcher 3, you will also enjoy Odyssey.
By the way, CPU usage always high in the game.

I've played most ac games through console or pc and honestly even though this game took the biggest step away from the AC formula it's still to this day the most fun I have had playing an AC game. The bosses, the abilities, the stealth, the gory kills, the humor etc. If you play AC for the gameplay its absolutely worth it but if you play for the lore/story then be cautious because it takes a big dive towards the mythical aspects of AC so it's not as grounded as the other games.

I basically played all the Assassin's Creed Games. Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey are two similar but also two very different games. For armors, shields and weapons Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a better choice because Greek armors are better than Egyptians ones. For the " Gods " and history, Greek ones are better for me too. However, based on gameplay, quests, main storyline is not so smooth in Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Assassin's Creed Origins did these things better. In Assassin's Creed Origins side quests are related to main quests like that star mission for our son etc. In Assassin's Creed Odyssey there are so many missions that you may lost the real thing and %70 of that missions are " go save this person from this bandit or go and bring me this flower etc" So they went quantity over quality here. Of course there are some very good missions like sealing Atlantis or Daphne's missions. For fight system both game are so similar but for boss fights I liked Assassin's Creed Origins better. For ship design and fights, Assassin's Creed Origins doesn't even have these so a plus for Assassin's Creed Odyssey here. Conquest Battles are a plus too but they are so similar I wanted them to be different to be honest.
Ambience is good but unlike in Assassin's Creed Origins it felt like Assassin's Creed Odyssey has so similar locations.
There are some good characters like Socrates, Barnabas, Alcibiades etc. But in Assassin's Creed Origins we have 1 love ,Aya, and that is what I like. Or it could be like Witcher 3 where you can sleep most of the women but at the end you have to choose one, either Triss or Yen. In Assassin's Creed Odyssey you can sleep everyone both genders but in the end there are no one you can choose to be with so it's just a mission thing. Also for ending in Assassin's Creed Origins you are satisfied and you understand that Bayek and Aya ( Amunet ) are the first ones to create the Brotherhood. So its related to Assassin's Creed Games.
In Assassin's Creed Odyssey there are nothing related to Assassin's Creed Games, and the both endings are not satisfying ( family one is a little bit satisfying) But cult ending was so rushed, I didn't like that at all. Also in Assassin's Creed Odyssey We are just a mercenary who mostly helps Sparta, a demi-god and we just seek vengeance. The real Assassin game ( which includes Assassins ) is Assassin's Creed Origins, in every aspects.

The most minus in the Assassin's Creed Odyssey is there are no hidden blades which Assassin's Creed Origins had because that is the most important item for an Assassin.

A tip= Play with Alexios. He is a better choice in main story line and Kassandra is a better Deimos. She can speak more evil and she is a better villain character. The relations are fitting with Myrrine or Nikolaos with Alexios better. Also for historically in ancient Greek women couldnt make the things that Alexios/Kassandra did. For example, In Olympic Games, women couldn't compete because that was a rule that is the historical side, for the game side armors are fitting Alexios far better than Kassandra.

In the end is it a bad game? No, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is not bad at all.

In story, and length Assassin's Creed Origins is better. General for me Assassin's Creed Origins is the best Assassin's Creed Game ever.
However, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is not bad at all and can be recommended.

For me, Assassin's Creed Odyssey= 8.5/10

Depending on how you entered (or re-entered) the franchise; if you start Odyssey, expecting the same gameplay and theme and enclosed feeling and aesthetic as the original AC games like Brotherhood then you'll be disappointed.

But if you start Odyssey, expecting an RPG with a leveling system and skill trees and is somewhat unfamiliar (or not that fond) with how the original AC games play out, then you'll be fine.

Odyssey is ::

>> BLOATED but CHILL... Which I actually appreciated because I fired up the game when I was exhausted by some fast-paced strategy games.

>> VAST... you can go from one point to another on the map on horseback, with auto-steering, and you'd have time to maybe wash the dishes, brew some coffee and whatnot...

>> the side characters are FUN... Ever tried debating philosophy with Sokrates himself?

Well worth the 230++ hours I've spent infiltrating forts and tipping the balance of power in ancient Greece, fighting the Minotaur, Medusa herself, Cyclopses.. cyclopsii? .... The Nemean Lion from the trials of Herekles itself.

Great game so far. The beautiful world of Greece has a much bigger map than the Egypt world map in AC: Origins (which was gigantious). Interesting story with several heavy dramatic acts different from each other, and tons of stuff & missions to do in the massive world. The graphics looks very good. It's a demanding titel though. I'm running the game in Ultra setting with some options lower @1080p getting 57-68 fps. ((( My PC spec: i7 6700k, GTX 1070, 32 GB Ram DDR4 -2133 Mhz))). I recommend lowering graphical options like "Volumetric Clouds" to high or very high, and "Anti Aliasing" to medium setting. This gave the game a boost of around 10 fps more.

If you liked Assassin's Creed: Origins then you will like this piece i think. AC: Origins was fantastic to explore & play through with it's magical warm landscapes, and this "Odyssey" story ranks slightly higher even, imo. Absolutly a top recommendation of the game.

/// Score: 9 of 10

The Good:
First game in a while that's gotten me to just sink ♥♥♥♥ tons of hours into it, kinda like The Witcher 3 did. The world is massive with tons to do, story is good, graphics are great, fun factor is strong.
Optimization seemed fine, ran well on my laptop, i7 7700HQ with GTX 1070.

The Bad:
MICROTRANSACTIONS. They designed the game to be a massive open world RPG that will take a long time to complete, which is normal for those types of games, but then add in microtransactions to progress faster, like exp and money boosts ffs. I really hope people don't buy into that ♥♥♥♥. Stop supporting these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practices.

Conclusion:
Buy the game, it's definitely worth the money, but for heavens sake please don't buy the microtransactions.

Top 10 favorite games of all time. I'm sure this is massively different than most Assassin's Creed games, but that is what drew me in. I never dreamed they would make an RPG (a good one at that) that was based in Greek times and you could PLAY AS A SPARTAN. I have been in love with Greek mythology since childhood, reading anything from the Iliad to Percy Jackson, and watching movies from Hercules to 300. This game is phenomenal. There is SO much to do. From fighting the front lines in battlefield form against Athens or Sparta, to hunting mythological creatures, to assassinating public figures, to hunting down cultists who have their fingers dipped so far into Greece, they control literally everyone, to fighting like a pirate on the seas against a number of enemies, to just plain walking around doing mindless work for people willing to pay a pretty penny, there is just So much to do in this game. just go out and try it. If you love Greek culture, RPG's, and just plain exploring, this is it. Even if none of those interest you, I promise it's worth a look. 10/10

Yes sure it's not following the other AC series and it's not actually a Assassin's creed but it's a wonderful game; Here's why:
+ Wonderful Enviroment ( very colorful and stunning!)
+ Fun quests
+ Nice Story
+ Awesome Soundtracks (as expected)
+ Great gameplay ( you can say it's the enhanced version of AC Origins)
+ Great Sea fights
+ Awesome post release contents
_________________________________________
-Optimization could have been better
-Movement animations still needs more work
_________________________________________

It's like AC Black flag and AC Origins had a wonderful baby! Overall : 9/10

273 hours later, I 100% AC: Odyssey.

If this is your first AC game, I recommend Origins before this, Black Flag before that, and AC 2 if you really want to get into the series.

This is an RPG game first which I liked very much. You can be a 'white knight' or you can be a psychopath that bangs even ugly blacksmiths. Personally I mixed it up, but absolutely banged everything I could even if it made me cringe.

Ikaros is not the best guide as he can miss a big shark just under me so I have to dive to 'mark' it.
If a shark engages you, swim directly up or down otherwise you're fish food. Picking them off from the surface of the water is best (Ghost Arrows of Artemis from the Hunter Tree are useful as well).

The first thing you should set out to do is upgrade your Spear of Leonidas as max level abilities are locked behind this requirement (have to complete main story missions).

Fully exploring areas is a good idea before you leave said area.
You have unlimited torches, so have a blast burning things.
Watch for snakes in dark interiors! And if you hear the floor moving, that's your cue to move too.

There are 3 classes: Hunter, Warrior, and Assassin.
Hunter can be surprisingly fun, but do NOT use fire as elemental damage if you're the sneaky type as you'll set the bush you're in on fire (you can snipe enemies from bushes). You do not have to craft elemental arrows, you can simply upgrade poison or fire, activate it and then shoot the arrows of your desire (you can't use both fire and poison, so it's one or the other).

Warrior is the most satisfying combat I've had in many a game. Keep in mind on 'normal' you can be killed in 3 hits so if an archer uses Spread Shot and you're too close, well enjoy your reload. Hard difficulty takes two hits to kill you (sometimes one), and Nightmare difficulty you may find yourself one-shotted by an enemies Vanish ability (which is supposed to do no damage). I played the game on Hard and switched it to Nightmare at level 80ish. It pains me to say it, but I'd recommend trying Normal then going from there,

Assassin is doable in this game, but you need gear with Assassin damage as its main damage. Don't expect to be one-shotting anything at the lowest of levels.

Gear comes in Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary rankings. Epic is the best overall despite a legendary set granting an additional bonus. Crit Chance, Crit Damage, Crit Chance while full health, and Crit Damage while full health I found to be the most beneficial modifiers. I prefer Fire so I also looked for Fire Damage and Elemental Buildup if my ideal bonuses were not present.

This game to me is worth MSRP (ofc I only buy on sale). I'd recommend the DLC too, but maybe throw that on your Wishlist and wait until you beat the main game which is roughly $18.00 on sale. The store where they sell in-game items is trash. $20 for some re-skins and zero content whereas $18 buying the base game and I can get 200+ hours of content is no contest. Those items are in the game files themselves, hypothetically all someone would have to do is download some type of Cheat Engine to unlock them. Personally, I say its not worth all that mess, just enjoy the game because it's a damn good one.

I really want to give this game 2 ratings, one as an open world action-rpg, and another as an Assassin's Creed game.

Skip ahead if you want to read my review of this game as a generic open world RPG.

As an AC game, it fails in almost every regard. It feels more like a 3rd-person, historically-set Far Cry game than anything else, by which I mean to say it feels like almost every modern Ubisoft title. The series can no longer be carried on the novelty that made the first few games feel so unique, we've seen the ancient world, we've met DaVinci, the novelty of these things was fun, and at the time it was enough to really make the game stand out, but ultimately the series was successful because it innovated, it tried to do things that no other game had done before, and it succeeded with the first AC game, and exceeded with the second.

I'll skip ahead to Origins and Odyssey, because this is where people claim they "got things right," but in reality all they did was create an entirely "new" franchise, and slap the AC title on it in order to drive sales, because neither of these games are AC games. They're generic open world RPG games, with all the standard Ubisoft tropes (climb the tower to mark things on your map, go to those things, rinse and repeat until the game is over). It takes away a lot of what made the AC games great, but I think it's biggest sin was simply taking such a HUGE step back in innovation. Everything it does well is something that has been done time and time again (mostly in other Ubi games) and has proven to sale games, but nothing was new, nothing felt unique. The sailing was worse than Black Flag, the climbing, while mostly smooth, has lost the "wow, I can climb that?!" feeling, since you can literally climb anything, so you don't have to think about your routes anymore, the combat isn't bad, but it just feels plain worse than games with similar "arkham" style combat, and didn't add anything to the system to make it stand out, the abilities mostly feel boring (though sparta kicking people will always be fun).

I could go on, but in general, as an AC game, it's an easy 2/10 for me, some good moments, but lost most of what I loved about the series.

As a generic open world RPG, however?

There's a lot of quests, most of them are at least SLIGHTLY more interesting than your average fetch quest (though only just slightly in most cases, this is no Witcher 3), the climbing doesn't feel as cool as in previous games, but the ability to climb anything in an open world RPG is neat and makes traversal overall more fun than in most RPGs, the combat is serviceable, nothing groundbreaking, but it's responsive and there's enough abilities that you don't have to play the same way for 60+ hours, it also doesn't lock you into any particular build. It's fun. Nothing exciting, but it's fun.

As a generic open world RPG, just like a hundred before and a hundred more to come, I'd give it an 8/10. It fills that roll incredibly well, it's just not a terribly interesting role to fill these days.

At the end of the day, the reason I gave it a thumbs down is because it just wasn't anything special. It claimed to innovate on the AC formula, but all it did was recycle ideas from other open world games, and nothing the game did was actually new, innovative or all that interesting, and after a dozen or so hours you won't have covered even a fraction of the content in the game, but it's all content you've experienced a dozen times already, just reskinned.

If you just want another open world RPG to keep you busy this will absolutely fit the bill, and if you aren't expecting anything you haven't already seen a dozen times, then you'll probably have a pretty great time, but personally, I'm hoping Cyberpunk will show these companies how open world RPGs SHOULD be done, and set a bar that other companies will have to genuinely start innovating again to compete with.

I'm going to be honest here - the game is boring.

The initial quests are fun! A bunch of interesting quests which quickly progress the story and... oops. Then it just... stops.

The quests branch out into what seems like an endless slew of boring, repetitive quests which seemingly never end, and they give so little experience that you have to go on for ages before you can start on the main story again, which then proceeds to branch out again and you have to repeat the same cycle over and over and oh my god just LET ME PLAY THE FUN PART.

To add to that, the combat feels... bad. "Higher Difficulty". Yeah right. Expect bigger enemy sponges and higher damage by the enemy. That's what it feels like anyways. It seems ubis idea of "harder" is to make enemies into sponges that also deal the equivalent of 6 nuclear bombs in damage. Its just hitting someone over and over and *sometimes* dodging an attack. Your character just keeps playing the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hit animation which feels sluggish and unresponsive. Though sometimes you do end up doing a cool finishing move, which, I mean it at least looks cool?

I didn't encounter many bugs apart from one time where I rammed an enemy ship and it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ catapulted me into the sky at like 9001 mph, exposing all of my crew members to about 500000000G's (dont fact check that) of force for a solid 15 seconds, it's a miracle some of them actually survived, AFTER THE FALL. It was funny so I'm going to let it slide but other than that, no bugs!

Oh also, there's microtransactions which let you get more XP faster. Yeah. Ubisoft wants you to pay to play less of their game. Wow.

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey takes place in 430 BC, when the alliances led by Athens and Sparta went to war over control of southern Europe. The development team has, of course, taken enormous liberties in writing the story, yet blinking at history textbooks. So the story flashes again with the big names of the ancients in any role.

The player takes on the role of a mercenary and is allowed to choose from two siblings at the beginning of the game. Kassandra and Alexios do not differ in any way in their abilities, but they do. Both are basically wordy and witty thieves in rags, but the acting performances bring surprisingly large nuances to the characters. Where Kassandra’s voice actor seems to have realized the style the game is aiming for and draws his role appropriately in the blink of an eye, Alexios ’actor shakes the scenes as in any C-movie as such.

Whichever of the two gets chosen, there is a long way ahead from a small island in the periphery to the limelight. The orphan, who lived with the small frogs of his entire youth, finds himself in the midst of great conspiracies and events shaking the whole of Greece in search of answers to the questions surrounding his family and the war. As it is an Assassin’s Creed game, the dim cults and shadow governments, of course, also revolve around the patterns.
The story has a tremendous measure. Even if you just stuck tightly to your finish, staring forward and skipping all sorts of side tasks, there will certainly be more than forty hours going through the game.

Odyssey is very close to Origins in terms of basic gameplay, which of course isn't terribly surprising. Not such a huge game was being developed in a year, so Odyssey and Origins were guaranteed to be made in parallel. Thus, the same game engine is used in large part, although small tune-ups have been made.

So there’s an open world action adventure with character development and this time even lightweight role-playing. All the conversations are now just in the right form of dialogues, where the player chooses their reply from a number of options and thus decides for themselves whether they want to smell all the opponents or be a kind and brisk mercenary. Neither option is automatically better, as depending on the situation, opening ones head to the skin may be worthwhile - and at least not by making your game completely salty.

It goes even worse when exploring the open world, where Odyssey seems to save rarely. So if you’re messing around in the woods looking for treasure, hunting animals, and causing general aggravation, it’s better to prepare yourself. Otherwise, there may be a nasty surprise ahead when you notice that the previous autosave is a few hours away.
This was a rather fragile implementation for 2018.

Now to the most controversial part of the critique, as the worst part of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is how damn big the game is. The Odyssey is as long as a year of famine, and the story is by no means super-rhythmic. Figuratively speaking, the story lurks, postponing the start of such cautious first 15 hours of play, after which something finally begins to happen. Even after this, there are often miraculous looting stages that do not really happen for hours other than keep doing grinding and cleanup work.

Pros.
+ Beautiful world.
+ The naval battle is nice.
+ A sense of adventure.
+ Fun story.
+ Either intentionally or unintentionally a funny performance.

An actionable and entertaining adventure that would have needed a bit of snipping.

Cons.
- Too many unspoken side effects.
- The story should have been summarized.
- Inefficient savings mechanism.

The game is smooth and fun. The controls work moderately, meaning climbing, for example, is much more functional than in those slightly older creeds.
8.6/10

If you’re looking for a game like the first ones in the franchise when it comes to gameplay, you probably won’t like Odyssey. If you don’t care about the RPG way the franchise took, you’ll have many hours of distractions on one of the most beautiful maps I’ve ever seen, with a fluid gameplay and an interesting plot, if you purchase the DLCs, despite the limited plot, you'll have many more hours of exploration and content (mainly in The Fate of Atlantis DLC), i recommend playing both DLCs after finishing the main plot. Like all games in the franchise, you will find historical figures and interact with them, (if you are going to play this game i wish you luck with the conversations with Socrates lol). Anyway, i thank AC Odyssey for filling the emptiness that The Witcher 3 gave me after finishing the game.

This review was written after finishing all the plots and obtaining all the achievements of the game.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Se você busca um jogo como os primeiros da franquia em relação a jogabilidade, provavelmente não gostará de Odyssey, caso você não se importe com o caminho RPG que a franquia tomou, terá muitos horas de distrações em um dos mapas mais bonitos que já vi, com uma jogabilidade fluída e um plot interessante, caso adquira as DLCs, apesar do plot limitado, terá muito mais horas de exploração e conteúdo (Principalmente na DLC O Destino de Atlântida), recomendo jogar as DLCs após acabar a história principal. Como todos os jogos da franquia, você encontrará figuras históricas e interagirá com as mesmas, (Se você for jogar, te desejo uma boa sorte para com os dialógos de Socrátes hehe). De qualquer forma, agradeço AC Odyssey por preencher o buraco que The Witcher 3 me deixou após finalizar o jogo.

Essa análise foi escrita após terminar todas as histórias e conseguir todas as conquistas do jogo.

Overview
In Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, players assume the role of Kassandra a “misthios”, starting on the isle of Kephallonia, and discover her story, her role in the assassin’s creed universe. Throughout your journey, you meet with several historical figures such as Perikles, and Sokrates. You journey through the country of Greece in 430BC, crossing many historical landmarks and famous cities such as Athens. Greece comprises of a variety of biomes, ranging from beautiful beaches to lush forests and volcanic depths. Journey through this fascinating land and change the course of history.

Pros:
Visually stunning.
Easy to learn combat.
Decent exploration with occasional surprises.
Decent narrative and protagonist.
Great soundtrack.

Cons:
Points of Interests around the map might feel a little repetitive.
The map is a little too large.
Spongey enemies.

Rating: Great

In-Depth Breakdown

World and Exploration
The world of AC Odyssey is filled with sprawling towns, forests and long stretches of water. There are many points of interests ranging from military encampments to ancient temples. Exploration is mostly done on foot, (water bodies are explored on boats/ship, of course) but you also have your own horse that you can call whenever.

Water bodies are filled sharks and merchant/pirate/bandit/military ships and boats to kill and destroy while the forests sprawl with animals like bears, lions, deer, etc. There are also many ancient temples, which almost always contain a small environmental puzzle of some sort. In cities you may find military encampments and loot locations. There are military and bandit encampments in the forests too.

There are many historical landmarks such as Athens, The Grave Of Sisyphos, The Statue Of Kronos, The Statue Of Poseidon, The Altar Of Prometheus, The Sanctuary Of Delphi, The Statue Of Athena, etc.

While exploring, look out for loot, which is literally everywhere.

There is fast travel.

Characters
I personally didn’t find the protagonist interesting, I felt like the dialogue choices took away from their likeness rather than supplement it in any way. There are some good and memorable characters in the game like Brasidas, for example. The voice acting, through the main storyline atleast, is good.

Cultists System
This was one of my favourite parts of the game. It is basically a list of people you have to uncover by acquiring clues about them through letters, writings and side/main quests, and then assassinate them. There was something really satisfying about going through the list and assassinating them one by one.

Scouting
Scouting is done using your trusty eagle, Ikaros. Ikaros can help you spot threats, treasures, hidden entrances, resources, etc.

Side Quests
AC Odyssey if full of quests all over it’s world. There are the typical fetch quests and kill 'x' amounts of people quests present in a daily quest randomly generated format. Overall, the side quests in AC Odyssey are OK, there are some interesting quests but most to me felt mundane.

Inventory Management
You carry the following items on you: melee weapons, bows, five pieces of armour (head, arms, torso, waist, legs) and mounts.

There are different kinds of melee weapons: regular swords, axes, heavy blades, heavy blunts, spears, etc. You can initially equip one melee weapon but an ability allows you to equip two at a time.

Unlike AC Origins, there aren’t different types of bows. Some abilities however allow you to acquire the Predator shot and Rapid fire etc.

Armour pieces can be slotted in and out individually and unlike AC Origins actually affect stats.

Combat
Combat in AC Odyssey feels fluid, animations flow nicely, controls don’t feel wonky and the parry system works nicely. It feels better to play than AC Origins.

Combat can be hard when playing on harder difficulties and especially so when the level difference between you and the enemy is more than about five levels. There seems to be a soft cap that just doesn’t allow you to do as much damage to an enemy more than 5 levels above you.

The various types of abilities in AC Odyssey makes it much more dynamic than AC Origins. You have abilities that allows you bring lighting upon the enemies, shoot arrows through walls, etc.

Stealth
Memorising enemy petrol patterns, positioning yourselves accordingly, and then striking from the shadows is the kind of stealth in this game. You pass through enemy camps while remaining crouched in tall grass, whistle to attract nearby enemies towards you, and then stick your "hidden blade" (a spear in AC Odyssey's case) through them. Stealth in AC Odyssey is very forgiving and is very easy to get into.

Abilities
There is a decent amount of abilities in AC Odyssey mainly divided into three trees – Stealth, Melee, and Ranged.

Stealth: Some abilities allow you to assassinate from a distance, increase assassination damage, distract enemies by spawning friendly NPCs, apply poison damage to enemies, etc.

Melee: Some abilities allow you to apply burning on your weapon permanently, bring down lighting upon your enemies, charge like a bull, heal, etc.

Ranged: Some abilities give you access to the Predator shot, Rapid fire, shooting arrows through walls, shooting arrows with increased damage, etc.

Ship
You ride upon the Adrestia, your personal ship (which also acts a mobile fast travel point). You can upgrade your ship using resources gathered from looting and dismantling gear. You can upgrade the ships health, the rowing stamina of your sailors and the damage dealt by arrows and spear. The ship combat itself is fine, it does the job.

Expansions (Legacy of the First Blade & The Fate of Atlantis)
I played through both the expansions aswell. In short – I didn’t find the story of either particularly interesting, the locations of The Fate of Atlantis are beautiful though. I would suggest doing a little research before buying the expansions through the season pass/ better editions/ individually.

Final Thoughts
Overall, Assassins Creed Odyssey is an excellent open-world RPG that brings new mechanics to the series and deepens some from Assassin’s Creed Origins. Gameplay is well thought out and fluid. It took me 172 hours to finish the game (including both expansions) on Normal Difficulty, while exploring the whole map(s) thoroughly and completing everything the game has to offer. I also managed to achieve 100% achievements in a single playthrough. I can recommend buying at a discount.

Alright, I don't play single player games often. Although I played most of the most of the common single player games, I didn't actually finish most of those games.

I wasn't that much interested in Assassins creed anymore when Ubisoft brought kinda like RPG system on that series. Still bought the game recently on steam sale. I didn't expect that much. But after starting I learned my misconception. This game is an absolute blast. Totally Loving it. Normally I don't even like RPG genre. This genre is too much complex to me. I couldn't even finish Witcher 3 cause it felt boring (personal preference).

Odyssey is comparatively easier. It didn't took long to understand the game mechanics. Graphics is also absolutely stunning in this game. I recommend this game to everyone. This will be a fun journey.

I really wish I could reccomend this game. Its a solid sandbox with a likeable protagonist and some really gorgeous scenery... but the microtransactions are so utterly shameless, disgusting and unnecessary that I just can't. They really are revoliting, pages and pages of additional purchases in a product that they're happily selling for up to $120. Now, if it were a cosmetic or two I might not be so irritated, but its in game items and xp boosters, and I in no way believe that they haven't balanced the game to pressure the audience into making those purchases.

Ubisoft is not the worst company in gaming, but they're still scumming.

Bought the ultimate edition prior to release and feel cheated and ripped off. The listed product specifications and expectations from experiences with Far Cry 5 and Ghost Recon: Wildlands and even Assassins Creed: Origins made me believe my PC could run AC:Odyssey as well. I was willing to take a performance hit.

However: AC:Odyssey buggers out w/o error message past the Epilepsy warning. Only after sifting through the support forums I found out that AC:Odyssey REQUIRES the Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) and will not run on first generation i5 or i7 CPUs and a few others. The game does NOT EVEN mention that the CPU is not supported, nor does it give ANY error message at all. Ain´t that cute?

This dishonest, cheaty and abominally false advertising of Ubisoft will make sure that this was the last Ubisoft product I ever purchased.

225 hours to visit all objectives and do all quests. Overall, this is a great game. Doing all the quests makes it clear that much of the content is by formula, and it can get repetitive(But that is common for the franchise). The setting is gorgeous. Overall graphical depiction of characters and the setting is as good as I have ever seen in an RPG.

Yes, I recommend this game, but not necessarily for people who want a more classic AC experience. The story and mechanics are so far removed from the days of early AC that long time fans would not recognize it if but for the title. That aside, its a decent action adventure game with RPG mechanics. It has most if not all the signs of Ubisoft's grindy designs, but can be overlooked for some legitimately entertaining stories including a number of side stories that are not at all necessary to complete the game. Its a long game, easily one of the longest ones I have played out of the series which well deserves the Odyssey part to its title. I almost wonder if this game would have done better without the AC franchise on it and just as a standalone adventure game, because there is hardly much connection between the AC franchise as a whole and this entry.

Dear fans,

i was told to write a letter because you're a lot and it was the only way to include everyone of you. I want to thank all of you for following my (very) long story, full of incredible adventures, monsters, autographs signed by celebs, and well, lots of flirts with tons of cool people :)
I'm glad you appreciated, even if i've heard some people saying that sometimes people asking me help looked a bit "copy pasted", and looked like an excuse to make the trip longer. I've also heard some other people saying that i should have invested in a good smith instead of picking up myself all those Olive tree branches.
If i can tell the truth, and if i can't i will anyway, i just wanted a calm life, maybe as a farmer, instead of risking my ass all the time.
But some "gods" decided i had to leave, go, fight and do things. Is that destiny, or maybe just a simulation?

Thanks for reading and excuse my bad English, i'm old and non native in the end.

Yours,

Kas


p.s. Alexios was asked to write a letter too, he was too lazy though.

Honestly wanted to like the game, have heard great things about the game over all, but it's honestly just not for me. It's an AC game in name only. The open-world hack n' slash thing is great for some people, and all the power to them, but it's not for me. I enjoyed the games for stealth and story, which just seem like less and less of an actual thing. I'd go on, but I'd probably just be rambling and repeating points.

The short version is, didn't really like it, don't intend to finish it. If you wanted a stealth game go play an older AC game. If Open World with lots of stabbing is your thing, than you're in the right place. I just found annoying.

This game, and every Ubisoft game, uses Denuvo Antti-tampering, a program that installs itself at kernel level (highest access and security level in a PC): Denuvo has also been proven to strongly decrease performance in games.
For some reason Steam doesn’t warn about this.

I'm going to keep this one short, unlike the insane grind and padding in this game.

When I first got this game a few years ago as a bundle with a Blu Yeti mic I got as a gift, I really loved it. the story seemed intriguing, the characters, and most importantly, the world is a masterpiece. The game play can be padded and exhausting which may make you give up. Let's do a few Pros and Cons before getting to the ending notes.


Pros
A MASSIVE beautiful world to explore, The team behind the world design did a fantastic job
The story, while flawed is generally good. The plot is with some twists here and there
Many characters have charm. and they do add life to this world.

Cons
After a certain point in the story, sudden "Level requirements" take a sudden jump, requiring you to do all the fetch quests and then some to reach a decent level to resume the story.
You gain EXP and a PAINFUL slow rate. Around level 30 and feeling like I was going nowhere, I stopped playing. Only way to get me back into this is to use Cheats.
The combat, while at first was quite fun, gets repetitive. It's like 78% of the game, and ALL enemies, REGARDLESS of your "Level" are sponges. This brings to the point of:
All enemies scale with you. This makes the idea of grinding to a higher level an absolute waste of time. You can be at level 99, all areas magically are 97, including starting areas. Some may be okay with this, but it makes grinding a waste of time as you have ZERO benefit of doing so.

The Bottom Line
The Padding is what turned me off. The combat could have been fun if it wasn't designed in a way to eventually become repetitive. I really wanted to like this game, the World, art, sound is all fantastic, but the gameplay really starts to feel shallow after awhile. I don't hate this game, but I just lost enjoyment after awhile. They added too much padding, which turned me off.

Don't let me cloud your judgement. but if what I said would also turn you off, then you may want to give this, and Valhalla a pass. If the issues and padding doesn't bother you, more power to you, and hopefully you get more enjoyment from this than I did.

The Verdict
Greatest Point: The World
Weakest Point: Story Progression
My final score is
6.5/10
How's it worth getting:
Get it on Sale.

Before you read this review, its coming from someone not massively into the franchise as a whole but has played a lot of the AC games. The last game i played to completion was black flag and I have completed all of its predecessors. Since Black Flag, the game has taken a big turn towards introducing RPG mechanics (loot, leveling), rather than the traditional "unlock more equipment as you go on"

Pros
- Huge Open world: The game is massive. Lots of quests alongside a big world to explore with lots of historical elements to get your teeth sunk into.

- Mix of Stealth / Action Game play: You have the choice to decide how to want to approach most situations, bar a few "don't get caught doing this" missions. If you want to be an archer with a mix of Stealth mechanics? You can do it. Do you want to be a Spartan warrior who kicks people from mountain tops? You can do it.

- Graphically Gorgeous: Playing this on ultra settings was a treat. The game, lighting and overall theme / setting of the game is truly a spectacle.

- History: The game is full of history anecdotes that gives you great insight to the ancient Greek world and their mythology. Plenty of interesting tales and creatures to discover. Big plus for history buffs.

- Story (No spoilers): The story is enticing. There are 3 different arcs you can complete with a mixture of reality and fantasy. Although if you haven't played the most recent games(like myself), some of the sections will seem slightly strange. They have definitely listened to the feedback of "Give us less game outside the animus, more in the world itself" which is a bonus.

- Decision Making: There is a definite sense of morality with a lot of the decision making. Actions you make will impact the result of the story / side missions as a whole. You don't feel like you are always following a story set out in front of you but instead one you can influence and dictate how it resolves. Be prepared to make tough decision to provide a greater good. You aren't just some Good Guy God who has to do the right thing everytime.

The Cons

- Variety: Although I mentioned a massive amount of content, the game suffers from the boring cycle of "I can't possibly do this myself, you have to do it" missions. Sometimes it just doesn't make sense that an NPC must unload a task on you. For example (No Spoilers): I was completing a quest chain for someone and he wanted to thank me by cooking a meal. However before this could happen he said i have to go out and hunt the meat myself. This is the equivalent of someone inviting me round for dinner, but I have to bring the dinner. The game is saturated with content like this, "I have a problem with this guy, please go there and talk/kill/steal from them and speak to me when you are done. Well what has this person done to help their own situation? Usually nothing. They were just waiting for you to come along and do it for them. This makes lot of the side missions become tedious. Also, its very annoying to go back to an NPC after completing their mission, for them to say "oh yeah, I also need this doing". Especially considering how many there are. However the "context" of the quests is always different so although you are doing the same tasks, you are doing them for different reasons. The gameplay repeats itself a lot, but the narration is varied.

- Fast Travel: Back in true AC spirit, there are locations you can climb to "synchronise". You then unlock this as a fast travel destination. On paper, not a bad thing as a lot of them give you access you stunning views. However there are wildly inconsistent. A lot of quest markers won't be near a fast travel point so a lot of time is spent travelling to point A / B then back to A. Large sections of the map will have 1 fast travel point and smaller sections will have 2 / 3+
For some reason you horse can't move faster than a gallop in city sections, making travelling very slow in some areas.

- Gear Progression: The game uses a "stat increase" type loot system. The game has legendary sets but most won't fit into your style of play. It then becomes a case of getting a sword with the same stats you have, but +10 DPS. No game play changes, simply a numbers game. If your build revolves around fire damage, any gear that gives +Posion damage will be useless for example. You can upgrade you gear to meet your current level so you never have to lose a piece of gear that rolled all the stats you need. The trouble is this makes a large portion of the loot you get entirely useless and merchant fodder.

- Level progression: As you begin there a lot of areas that have enemies that out level you. The problem is this is quite immersion breaking. "I can kill 10 wolves at once but this Peasant with a spear will kill me because he out levels me." Not a unique problem to this game, but a problem none the less. However once you get past level 50, the enemies will level with you and you will rarely find something you can't kill.

- The mercenary system: The game includes a system somewhat (albeit loosely) based on the nemesis system from the Shadow of Mordor series. The game uses a bounty meter. The more bad actions you commit (i.e stealing, murder etc) the higher your meter. The problem is the mercenaries just become an annoyance who will disrupt what you are doing. As soon as you reach a certain bounty, you will be constantly met with the message "A Mercenary is nearby" who will aggro you as soon as he/she sees you. They don't feel part of the world, they feel like they are being constantly generated and spit out next to you. This can be frustrating when exploring cities as they are always on you and offer nothing rewarding for dispatching them. The bounty can be paid off no matter where you are so its an easy problem to overcome but feels like a wasted mechanic.

Summary - Take this review with a pinch of salt depending on what type of player you are.

Overall. i did enjoy my experience with this game. The reason I am not recommending it is due to my own completionist nature. Because there is so much content, it eventually becomes a chore to go through it all. If you are looking for a game with a decent story, providing you don't mind missing areas that appear as a "?" on your map, you will have a blast. If you are like me and want to explore everything available to you to give you that sense completing what the game has to offer, I would avoid it for your own sanity. The term "wide as an ocean, as deep as a puddle" comes to mind. This game has some incredible moments but the game play loop made it a slog for me to get to them.

This is my first Assassin's Creed game.
Loved everything about this game. The world design is gorgeous, the story is fantastic and you really get attached to some of the characters, if not all of them. Looting and levelling up wasn't a burden for me, it was pretty fun even.
You can choose from three classes and 9 weapon types, mix them up and create your own playstyle. Mine was main Assassin, secondary Warrior, with a sword and daggers equipped... and your Spear of Leonidas, of course.
There's a lot to say about this game, but what you should know is that I recommend it 100%.

Introduction

First of all, I don't like Assassin's Creed games. I hate them and the last time I played an AC game was a couple of years ago, with AC III. Even so, I kind of both love and hate Odyssey. I think that this is the best AC game up to date and that they had really improved upon the franchise after a couple of disastrous titles. While playing this game I am constantly reminded about open-world games and RPG's. I think this is a good thing and an improvement, however, it also diminishes the identity of what an AC game should represent.

Story

The story is really good but it is held back by the grind. Without going into spoilers, you start with a story that really moves forward and introduces to you interesting characters that are always behaving according to their belief. It's one of those stories in which you always want to learn a little more before ending your current gaming session but it has a fatal flaw, it becomes stale. At some point you will notice that the story gets "stuck" and all you are really doing is a bunch of side quest that is disguised as main story quest and this is a bummer because you will do this for at least 10 hours in a row before moving on to the next part of it. Maybe even more if you spend too much time in actual side quests.

Some Notes

The game is optimized very poorly. Like seriously badly. You are going to need a high specs machine in order to reach those 60 fps. Even so, medium specs can opt to run it at 30 FPS caps at is still a very enjoyable experience, at least at the beginning.

The grind is huge and can become quite tiresome. Ubisoft really wants to make you spend more money in this game with what they call "time savers" which are basically bonuses that make your progression faster but even with those bonuses it will still be a long journey of grind and repetitive action. The player will follow the same route over and over again: Accept quest, kill a bunch of bad guys (sometimes even good guys), kill a bunch of mercenaries that had come for your head, kill a bunch of reinforcements, kill some captains, run back to quest giver, get rewarded and accept the next quest. This grind is not for the faint of heart.

Gameplay

Gameplay-wise the game adopts a more RPG style in which the player acquires weapons and equipment which have a level attached to them. I don't like this. While one can upgrade their equipment in order to make it upscale to your current level, that takes an insane amount of resources and I am not talking about money. I am talking about wood, stones, gems, and hides. The amount you need to just upgrade one piece of equipment is enough to keep you playing for 2 hours before you are able to upgrade and those are 2 hours of just searching for the materials.

As such, the armor and weapons will become obsolete very fast. The player will need to change their equipment and hope that they get their weapon of preference or else they will be stuck with something they might not truly enjoy. I really tried to stick to my favorite equipment but is just not viable and also would require for me to sacrifice a bunch of time and sweat just to get them to my current level.

Combat is the best in the series. Finally, an AC game in which you can't one-shot everyone nor are you a god with infinite parry. While parry does stick as a core mechanic, enemies now have attacks that not only you cannot parry, but also are ferocious and fast. Each enemy has their own resistances and weakness as well as perks like having a companion animal or making extra damage when their HP is low. I particularly hate the one in which they unleash fire explosions since it can kill you easily but it nevertheless it was still fun to beat.


Sum Up

+ The story is really good.
+ Combat has more depth and has been improved by a large margin.
+ Looks beautiful in some parts, in particular oceans and skies.
+ Voice acting is great, protagonist and antagonist perform spectacularly.
+ Offers the player a wide arrange of options with 3 different skills trees.
+ While there a bunch of micro-transactions, it is still a high-quality game.

- The game requires a lot of grinding on the player part.
- The story gets stuck and doesn't move forward for 2-3 chapters(10-15 hours)
- Equipment level is an issue and makes it frustrating to keep legendary sets.
- Very poorly optimized and also presents a couple of immersion breaking glitches.
- Requires a lot of time and compromise in order to beat, can become tedious to continue at times.
- It gets very repetitive in some instances, with players repeating the same loop for hours.
- Combat is improved but at the same time, assassination and parkour are diminished.
- Sometimes objects will become blurry (even with the depth of field turned off) and sometimes they will even become pixel art.


Conclusion

Odyssey presents a major improvement to the series at the cost of sacrificing a lot of aspects that were in previous games and a large part of what an AC game should strive to be. I like the graphics, voice actors, combat, story, open world and the RPG feeling it has to it but I also dislike the assassination and parkour being diminished, the grind, the sudden halt in the story, the poor optimization and the amount of effort that is put into making the player spend extra money in the game.

If you like AC, get it. Even if you don't, consider getting it if you like open world games and have a bunch of time to play/can focus on a single game for a long while. I consider this to be the best game of AC that has ever been released and despite all of its flaws, healthy addition to the franchise.

For me, this is a serious contender for GOTY! Ubisoft has been honing their formula over the years and this game really hit my sweat spot.

Ancient Greece really comes alive in this game, and it is beautiful; you could spend the rest of your days just taking photos in-game. The open world is huge but doesn't feel overwhelmingly busy like in all previous Ubi games; it's almost manageable this time, and most locations feel fresh and not repetitive. This might be the first Ubi game I ever finished; on all the others I keep getting distracted with exploring the open world and obsessively completing its activities until I get bored and burned out well before the story wraps up.

I loved the story too but it's far from perfect. Does anybody still care about the modern day setting and crazy conspiracies? It's boring and pointless at this point, but at least it's also mercifully brief. Near the end, the story also takes a sci-fi detour involving aliens and their technology and whatnot. Dudes! Ancient Greece! What could possibly be more interesting than exploring Ancient Greece? Don't ruin it.

The gameplay is very finely tuned here and it's a blast; it really feels like you're in a sandbox and can approach problems however you want. I love the RPG detour the series has taken lately, and it's pretty cool to go through your loot and gear up and skill up to play to your strengths. All in all, a great game, and a towering achievement!

I feel like I should like this game. On the surface, it seems to have all of the qualities of a good third-person action rpg. It ticks all of the checkboxes for a decent Assassin's Creed. But I just don't. I can't help but feel like this game is a mix of mechanics that are all about 80% complete, and the narrative is just barely passable with tons of stilted dialogue and character interactions.

For example, the fight with the Cyclops (a local crime boss with only one eye) was some of the most confusing and ham-fisted gameplay I've experienced all year. (minor spoilers follow) I am told that the Cyclops and his men have docked on a nearby peninsula, so I scout the area out with my magical pet eagle. It looks like a harbor swarming with guards and surrounded by cliffs. I determine that an approach from the cliffs near where the Cyclops is hanging out would be the safest and most effecient for assassinating him. As I am crawling along a waterfall outside the walls, I suddenly get thrown into a cutscene.

The camera pans and reveals Cyclops drowning some guy because he called him 'Cyclops', which is apparently a name he does not like. That's when Kassandra, my character, casually strolls into the scene (when tf did she get over the walls?) and reveals the obsidian false eye that she stole from him (which was itself a stupid idea that I couldn't really object to). She then takes the eye and shoves it into a nearby goat's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and tells the Cyclops to chase after it. No joke. She actually did that.

The game then drops me right in front of the Cyclops and all of his still living guards, and I proceed to run around like a lunatic trying my best to not die while slowly chipping away at their numbers. Eventually I succomb to the sheer number of guards and their arrows, but not before a particularly stupid moment in which Kassandra grabs a zipline instead of a ledge and proceeds to zoom to another part of the harbor with even more guards.

I feel like that whole series of events exemplifies why I dislike this game. It tries so hard to be multiple things, and ultimately fails to be good at any of them. I mean, in a game called 'Assassin's Creed', I am unable to simply sneak up and assinate a guy because the game needs to get in its own way and show a cutscene where my character shoves an obsidian eye up a goat's ass. Combine moments like that with a clunky parkour system so full of context sensitivity that your character will often do things you don't want them to do, a derpy bounty hunter system in which the AI will sometimes glitch out and just stay in one place until it suddenly teleports across multiple islands to join one of your fights already in progress, and a mish-mash of rpg mechanics, some of which mean you must get your arbitrary stats higher that the other guy's arbitrary stats before you can actually kill him when you sneak up and 'assassinate' him. In an Assassin's Creed game. And that's by no means an exhuastive list.

Add in all the microtransaction stuff too. Anyone remember when your single player games didn't have 3 ads on the main menu trying to entice you to buying stuff off their store, or XP boosts that give the developers a financial incentive to make the grind more tedious? All of these things together make me wish I could refund this game and buy it again when it is 50% off. Or just play the countless better games out there that actually have a cohesive design.

And that's not to say I don't understand why people are enjoying this game. Despite all of the above, this game can be fun and it's packed with content. I just wish Ubisoft would drop the AC brand, make a new IP, and design the full-blown historical rpg from the ground up that they so obviously want to make. The AC brand should then be refocused on the whole 'assassin' part of the name and become more like a medieval Hitman, rather than a watered down Witcher that is confused as to what kind of game it wants to be.

250 hours into the game in my first playthrough, finish everything including the dlc and you still wonder why I give a negative review?

I would begin with main quest. Main quest is poorly written and require dlc to fully understand what's going on. If you buy standard that doesn't include dlc, be ready to get confused or feels like something is missing. It would be a spoiler to mention it, so I would leave it at that.

What about side quest? Side quest is basically a mix of good and nightmare. Seems like multiple writer are hired by ubisoft to work on the story but only a few stand out such as quest related to Alkibiades. Whoever do a job portray and wrote the side quest related to Alkibiades definitely deserves a thumb up. But sadly to said, majority of the side quest feel half ass to even enjoy it.

If you buy and play this game, avoid doing contract. Contract a repetitive quest to grind exp and resources. What you need to do is accept the quest but only do it if you are near the quest location.



Next is the gear along with the resources and cost upgrade. This is absolutely a nightmare and is very lacking in balance. Cost of upgrade is particularly insane for gear especially for legendary and epic. What makes it more ironic is that despite legendary being considered the highest tier, it still perform worst than epic. This is mainly because a full set of legendary armor would have 16 engraving in comparison to epic which can have up to 20.

If you are playing at difficulty below hard or default scaling, gear isn't on par with your level won't be much of a problem. However, hard difficulty with heavy scaling means that your gear must always be on same level with you or otherwise it won't be able to deal sufficient damage to kill the enemy. This is due to the enemy level being scaled on the same par with you. The effect is very notorious as soon as your gear is 3 level below your current level.

Upgrading is a very costly process that a single piece of equipment can cost up to 200k and a gargantuan amount of resources just for an increased of 10 level for legendary gear. Sure, there is a capped limit on the cost but it still insane. At 250 hours, I could barely grind enough to upgrade 8-15 pieces of my legendary gear to my current level.

You might say the point of rpg is not to have every gear fully upgrade. I agree with that, but if I want to try different weapon and have fun with it, it become tedious that I might as well skipped it.

The game also have serious problem with copy and paste. You visit 1 tomb, you generally already visit all of it. Tomb is boring and can be very large, making you waste time exploring it. There is only spike trap and snake. No puzzle, nothing at all.... Cannot even recall 1 tomb that is being totally different or unique.

The problem with this game is that Ubisoft overextend the effort in details particularly historial site which they done well. But in the process, they make gameplay related area being copy and paste cause it is faster and less time consuming. Those historial site are pleasing to watch in the eye of beholder but they hold little to no values to the gameplay and storyline itself.

As for riddle such as Ostraka. They are fun but they can also be a pain in the ass to solve without looking into google due to the inaccuracy of the description. The riddle say it was underneath the bridge? Good luck looking down the bridge, it isn't even close to the bridge itself. Riddle say "I am at where the statue finger point at".. Hell no, not even close to where the statue is pointing.

It frustrate me to no end due to how inaccurate the description was, way too off the point.

And then you have up to 5 profile for equipment. Fun right? Until you decided to play jack of all trade build that can be assassin, warrior or hunter then the pain start begin. If you wanted to switch to others, you basically need to go to inventory menu to switch your profile. How fun it was to switch profile during combat, might as well just stick to 1 style of playing.

Cost of the profile is not cheap either and as I mention, cost of upgrade gear is pricely as well. 250 hours into the game and I only have a full set of gear for 3 profile.

People say this game got plenty of bug, here is some that I gonna list out.

Some engraving doesn't work.

There is more to list, the list probably can rival what I wrote about Unity but I just gonna stop here. Oh well... I still expecting Ubisoft to make an AC of good quality, the last one that I consider to be good would be AC Rogue. Hopefully ubisoft stop making it way too grindy just to force people to buy from microtransaction shop.

Over 80+ h in and I'm still far from completing the story, as well as other aspects of the game. It's gigantic and diverse, with rich story and characters. The world is simply beautiful - I keep stopping all the time in order to take screenshots because it's so breathtaking. Is it better than Origins? Yes, it is, both mechanic wise, as well as story and world wise.
Btw, don't listen to the people that say it has nothing to do with Assassin's Creed games. Quite on the contrary, it lets you play the assassin way, justl ike you did in previous games, should you choose it. The series has developed immensely since the Origins game into a new and rpg-driven direction, which makes it much better than the previous instalments in the series, save for AC 2 and Revelations. I'd put it just after it.
9/10 so far.

EDIT: I have just completed three main story arches. AMAZING! Some side quests left, as well as random places/ underwater locations/ caves to complete. It took me 114 h in oder to end the main story. It was quite an odyssey. To sum it up, I love the new rpg-like direction of the series. So much better than most of the previous installments. I keep it at 9/10. Well done, Ubisoft, well done!

Amazing! I love Ancient Greece, but I've never imagined how it could look like in real life. The world is real here. However you understand all game-like things (you can run over the island for 5 minutes), but it doesn't matter. This rocks, grass, sun, sea, people and their stories - it's one world, and I want to live there, that is the reason I return to the game again and again

I will admit that I was one of those people who complained about the game saying it dsidn't look like an AC game, I didnt like the fact there was no assasin blade, was fearfful the RPG element and the choice dialogues, the outfits and the big battles I complanied about all o it but Im very happy to admit that I was so wrong and after about 60-70 hours in I will say that this is rapidly becoming my favorite AC game. Im not even missing the Assasin Blade, thats how much I like the spear. I didn't think they could do any better than Origins and thought were going to destroy everything good they just came out with in the game. There are so many side quests and places to explore, you could spend any day doing justt that stuff and never advance the main quest. Oh and the Ocean combat is great, its a lot like Black Flag in terms o attacking and being able to board & the customizations are really cool. You have archers and javelin throwers, I love everything they did with it. Im just blown away and Im glad I went into it no expecting to like it because it has been such a great game so far.
& The contents just keeps on coming, more dlc's hell yea!!

Finished the Game, the ending blew my Mind.

If you can get past the first few hours of the game filled with cringy dialogue, poor characters, and annoying accents, it actually turns into a fantastic game.

Good
+ Fantastic beautiful graphics
+ Open world
+ Naval ship battles
+ Great combat system (mainly a mix of attack, parry, and dodging, but it feels great.
+ Loads of content
+ Some interesting and mildly amusing side quests

Bad
- The first few hours of the game were incredibly boring (it gets better once you get off the island)
- Voice acting is very poor with heavy unneccessary accents.
- The characters are mostly poorly developed, especially the main character.
- Microtransactions (not really needed, but they are there...)

Conclusion
Overall, I felt like this game could have been much better than what it was, and its kind of a shame that we likely won't ever see another Roman era AC game, however AC Odyssey is beautiful, fun, and has loads of content.

The map is huge, there are tons of side quests, great story line, you can pick what you wanna say, and much much more ....
Reminds me sometimes at the witcher 3, which is good. It looks almost the same like the previous game, but the performance change is huge. With their previous game I had issue with permanent CPU usage of 100%. But in this one it climbs only to 80% on some heavy populated areas. Anyway, get this game its really worth playing!

Ubisoft has delivered a marvelous experience for a player to immerse into the Greek world. Moreover bringing back the characters from our history books for a live interaction through this game. Three years after its launch still makes playable once again. Overall a hell of an experience for me.

GREEK RPG

I'll be honest, if you are an old AC fan before the series turned over to be ARPG this may be not your game, if you seek good polished games this may not be for you too, that said, i got this game because its kinda the only modern game where you play in Ancient Greek and its a RPG, so i enjoyed the scenary by a lot, and the creatures. The main story was good, the side story....most were grind and borish i did a lot of them trying to find something remarkable... after some time i just ignored side missions because i didnt bother to finish them anymore kek, sea combat its the strongest good point in this game, the weakest point for me was the basically the same simple swing animation for melee weapons both for enemies and myself.... so combat instead of unique become more like a wall/burden to unlock X quest content etc... all in all its a flawed gem i guess, so buy only at sale!


PROS
- You can grab Zeus' balls
- Ancient Greek culture; and the diversity each greek region has
- War of Sparta Alliance vs Athens Alliance
- Beautiful places to travel and enjoy
- Main story
- Good looking armors/sets
- The fight with mythical creatures mainly the Minotaur was awesome
- Photo mode
- Cute eagle pet


CONS
-*MAINLY FOR ME* But combat its really lackluster, so its one of these games fights instead of giving adrenaline i just felt bored.
- Reused content, Ubisoft usually does this, so isnt a surprise at all.
- You have sex with some npcs and then you basically became strangers to each other (sometimes you basically just unlocked them as crew members lmao) <my point is, i felt this was strange or unnatural >
- I tried to be a druid, but for some reason my pet companions kept goin' MIA, so i refunded that perk because that was pissing me off

NOTE: 7/10

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is the second opus happening in ancient history. You will be able to play as Alexios or Kassandra with for the very first time in the history of the franchise, the opportunity to decide your characters actions and fate through the troubled times of the Peloponnesian war and play a significant role in the fight for the domination of either Sparta or Athens.

Developed and published by Ubisoft, Odyssey, with the marvelous environment, scenery, gameplay, and spotless mechanics sets an entirely new level for Assassin’s Creed and is probably one of the best RPG we got since the Witcher III.

9.5/10
Life's necessity


Let's connect
Twitch • Discord • Reviews• Steam group• Giveaways

Immersion & Questing

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is taking us through a war-torn Greece as a misthios, a man-for-hire, who is searching for answers (cue family drama) and adventures. Through multiple story arcs, each more interesting than the other is added a spectacular amount of side quests that are intricated somehow in the decisions you made.

Indeed, Odyssey emphasized dialogues and choices. Some of them can have a drastic impact on the story, others quest and how people react around you. Based on your previous decisions, NPCs are going to be referencing your previous actions and can potentially cut some quests from your storylines.

The results of this are two folds: with so many different endings and choices, there is a replayability value rarely seen in an Assassin’s Creed game and it all manages to intricate your actions into the different story arcs and create an incredibly immersive universe based around your vision of your character.

Overall, Odyssey is extremely rich in content. The integration of the side quests within the main story makes it so that you will want to do more of them! We calculated that a good 60 to 70 hours can be put in the game without finishing it. You will still have plenty of work to do.

Graphics & Exploration

We played the game on Nightmare difficulty with exploration mode, the latter is a nice touch by Ubisoft because you must search for the objectives and use the skill set Ikaros, your eagle possesses to locate them and not just mindlessly go after them. These two elements together made it so that some fights and activities had to be planned in order not to die a stupid death.

Exploring the game in this beautiful reconstruction of ancient Greece unlocks little excerpts of the history behind buildings, characters and other historical elements in this country that breathe and bleeds history. A real plus for any history nerds.

Let’s also mention the fact that there are no loading times between the different maps, sea, mountains or anything at all. It’s a feat considering the graphics and the fact that Greece is exceptionally vast in this game.

Indeed, through exploration, you can easily witness how everything is wonderfully tied up together. Graphically, the game is terrific, with spectacular scenery and a great photo mode, mechanics are fluid, it is the kind of technical prowess that we would expect from Ubisoft.

The scenery is just utterly gorgeous from the open sea to the beautiful forests, islands, cities and their decorations, Odyssey is a treat for the eye. Animations are superb, you can easily sense how everyone feels about whatever they are saying and how they are feeling.

Gameplay & Combat

The game is dependent to your level, you can’t just wander (you can) into a zone and expect to be just fine. A few level differences mean death most of the time. Leveling is fair, it will get slower the higher your level is, but I never felt like I had to grind for levels or anything. It all happened as I was playing.

Drawing inspirations from quite a few RPGs, the skill tree is built around your game style. You have the freedom to develop it the way you want to through three main choices: Hunter (ranged), Warrior (melee) and Assassin (stealth). You can most probably mix ‘em up as I did with a Warrior-Assassin build.

Your equipment needs to be carefully thought out and the same goes out for the bonus you are engraving within your weapons and armors. Also, fashion hunters: five pieces of equipment are going to change your in-game appearance.

Fighting in this game revolves around dodging and counter-attacking with light and heavy attacks (at least in nightmare difficulty). Mechanics are fluid, fights are challenging, but the biggest down part is that you are limited to 4 active skills from the three treelines available. This is extremely limiting, and I stopped counting the times I had to press start mid-fight to change the bounded skills to something that could be useful in this specific fight and adapt the strategy Alexios (or Kassandra) was doing to sometimes, survive. This specific issue was for me game-breaking, immersion-breaking and plain annoying.

Odyssey gives the player a vast array of choices as of which weapons they are going to use, axes, bows, daggers, maces, staves, spears and swords all have their pros and cons and are just different enough to be meaningful and give a different in-game experience.

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is also bringing back naval fights and navigation from the depths of Black flag and Rogue. While not a lot of things changed besides making your ship upgradeable, is the fact that you can now have lieutenants on your ship that gives a passive bonus. While it is not innovative, it is the best Naval fights we’ve ever seen in an Assassin’s Creed.

Finally, a system of mercenaries very similar to what we can find in Shadow of War is proposed, based on the illegal actions you do throughout the game, your bounty will raise, said mercenaries will then hunt for you and try to kill you. Killing them instead, induce a fun leaderboard of mercenaries, that you can climb for rewards. This is entirely optional, you can ignore this and while it is just a plus to the game, it adds a great atmosphere around it, with more immersion and some more challenging fights.

There is also an entire pan of gameplay revolving around conquering a region. Just like Shadow of War once again, you will need to conquer or defend a plot of land for either Sparta or Athens by killing local leaders, pillaging and lowering the enemy presence in the area.

Very few bugs

While everything in the game seems to be working flawlessly, the lock-on system can give you some trouble maneuvering the camera when fighting enemies in a small space. Finally, the game didn’t have a game breaking bug once during my run and for such a game it is quite incredible. Odyssey suffers from a lot of collision issues though.

Conclusion

Odyssey’s world is by far the biggest, most gorgeous and with the most content of the franchise. It feels like Ubisoft took what was best in recent gaming, made it their own and delivered the best Assassin’s Creed of the franchise history. With marvelous environment, scenery, gameplay and spotless mechanics, Odyssey sets an entirely new level for Assassin’s Creed and is probably one of the best RPG we got since the Witcher III.

Well what can I tell you.. This is a new kind of Assassins Creed and I f*ckin love it!

This game is incredible, everything I could of ever asked for in an open world exploration rpg action game it has and I've only scratched the surface. I'm still on the first Island, I want to complete everything and find everything in the game so I will still be on it for awhile more lol. Last time I played an AC game there was no swimming, now there is and there is some cool sh*t to find in those waters ;) Almost no climbing limitations, literally go anywhere you want. Game content superb, so much its overwhelming, map size is ridiculously huge!!!

Now time for the bullsh*t, there is some but doesn't ruin the game for me. There are performance issues, this game caps out at around 50 fps, its dips down to around 40 and up to 60 but average is 50 which is still ok for me, but only gets low when the areas are clutter f*cked with objects. There is mad screen tearing too but I found a fix, if running Nvidia card go to Nvidia Control Panel, find Vertical Sync, turn it ON, force that sh*t!! Restart computer, run the game, turn on in-game vsync, set in-game fps to 60 cause thats all your going to get lol. After that she's golden ;D Runs most of the time smooth and looks fantastic. More bullsh*t I have the super low sound voice bug but only in cutscenes, I've tried many fixes nothing works, just have to wait on Ubisoft to fix that - but for me I'm all about exploration, rpg elements, and combat, so subtitles are fine - do my own voice impressions hah. But still it is now January you guys should have this fixed by now, so yes this could actually kill the game for a lot of people, but not me ;P

Amazing game with some bullsh*t to be fixed, but I still will crush this game till theres nothing left to play ;P But on the another note is better to wait for a sale like me, winter sale was 50% off ;D

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: THIS IS A MUST PLAY GAME FOR RPG ACTION EXPLORATION LOVERS!!!
-Ship battles (Probably one of my favorite things to do in the game)
-Assassinations contracts
-Conquer battles (Choose a side)
-Ring battles
-Legendary animal hunts (Bow is very useful in combat ;p)
-Set your own path, own actions (man I've f*cked some things up already LOL)
(Beware, you can really mess your game up by killing the wrong people, it is like Skyrim where quests can become unavailable due to your actions :S)

New Update:
-Finally fixed the voice bug in cut-scenes, thank you thank you thank you!!
-New higher graphical options, very detailed game, very pretty
-New quests and gear

Ubisoft failed to mention that the game requires AVX support. The game crashes on startup without AVX.
I had to start the game and let it crash 10 times in order to hit the 5 minute minumum to leave this review.

Due to the comments, I am editing this review to add my current hardware. I bult my PC in 2016 and have never had an issue with any other PC game.

CPU: Intel G4560, 3.50Ghz (released in 2016) <- Does not support "AVX"
RAM: 16GB
GPU: GeForce GTX 1050Ti
Motherboard: B250M
Storage: 500GB SSD

The game itself is great but Ubisoft makes it unplayable.I am constantly having issues logining into my Ubisoft account so I can play games I bought on steam. Now the game just keeps crashing with sh*t support again from Ubisoft. Also previous games I had with disappeared from my account. So for your sanity sake don't buy from Ubisoft, even though they make great games, how the company manages it's customers games outside of steam makes it extremely aggravating and feel like a rip off. I am beyond sick and tired Ubisoft and hope they end up like Gamestop!!!!! Steam should force them to stop this or drop their product.

I've waited to finish everything in this game and then give proper review
from many perspective this game is amazing and it is one of the best open world RPG genres in this decade
the game narrates stories of Greece and the assassins in its timeline in a perfect way,it makes you play for a long time without any boredom,the world map of game is massive and they attend the details perfectly.
the thing that made this game a way better game is its DLC's;the first one focuses on a great story and the second one has 3 individual world that each has new mechanism the base game doesn't have.
Some of the old assassin creed franchise fans may think this is not an assassin game any more,their thoughts are both correct and incorrect at the same time,i agree that it has several piles of fantasy stuff but it still has many assassins features so don't judge this game easily.
for the last part of my review i want to point 2 negative things about this game.
first,like other Ubisoft products this game has many bugs
second,despite the fact that i have a good system i don't know why this game gave me a lot drop FPS, i think this is the biggest problem that has to be solved.

Oh Ubisoft, you foolishly made me think you were tunring over a new leaf. The last few years I even started to support you because you were doing better. But alas here we are. The game is fantastic. I love the setting, SOME of the characters, and the gameplay is fun to me (except naval combat isn't nearly as fun as it was in black flag IMO). BUT, and this is a big but and i cannot lie, The microtransactions are disgusting. You WILL hit an XP wall even if you say "Oh ok I just won't buy the bonus xp" and this WILL distroy the fun you were having up until that point. Where you either need to grind and grind and grind for hours just to be able to play the next story quest oooooor F*** you give me money. Thems the brakes. I'll change this review if they patch that but I doubt they will.

A Ticket to Ancient Greece Tour!
Assassin's Creed (AC) Odyssey is nothing close to an AC game, eventhough it somehow(!?) carries the bound with the series' lore. It's more of an open world rpg within ancient Greece. They started this type of approach with Origins continued (& improved) with Odyssey (then Valhalla etc.), and it works surprisingly well for the players that enjoys this genre!

I started this game on a "free weekend" promotion, and I grab the full game (with season pass) in the end of it. Not sure if it was due to;
well made ancient greece athmosphere (with a big war between greek and spartans on the side) or
Cool side characters (including famous philosophers, warriors, demi-gods and more) & quests or
the blend between real and mythology or
freedom to approach the combat (either brawler or assassin way) or
the troll legendary oiled bath rope I found from a random blacksmith (that gives me 500%+ damage if my character covered with black oil which isn't even in game)!
but something kept me intrigued and attached to the game. I must admit I wasn't big fan of the sea battles, but upgrading my ship, adding characteristic captains and crews to it, and even just traveling on the water with beautiful view was satisfying enough. (Eventually you become boss of the sea and enjoy destroying those legend ships that bullied you early on.) Also, AI was little janky and predictable, but it wasn't bad enough to ruin experience. That being said, it has cool battles, some nature interactions such as predators hunting (don't expect national geographic experience, they just kill) and attacking to people around.

I highly recommend you to buy the package with season pass on (that gives free copy of AC 3!?) since both of the DLCs are amazing (even exemplary to others about how to make a DLC), and you get access to cool skills early on. I consider myself lucky that I delayed my completion long enough to catch latest crossover content they added. It was also worth playing!

There are much more to tell and much hints to give such as;
> press assassinate button while you holding your eagle to pet it,
> paralyzing arrows works with bow skills in case you wanna recruit / tame,
> hold mount button to whistle that draws enemy,
> Spartan kick may provide amusing moments,
> you can parry arrows,
> weapon bonuses on secondary weapon slot applies to both... the list goes on and on but I'll let you discover 'em ^^

As verdict, if you are looking for an old school AC game stay away! However, if you are looking for a nice open world rpg set in the Ancient Greece with both gorgeous historical and mythical sceneries (that has some AC elements), then what are you waiting for?!

PS. You have to play this game by connecting to your Ubisoft account. So, make an account and download their launcher from here[ubisoftconnect.com] before you start playing for less headache!

AC:O is a game full of conflict, not only in its story.
The game offers one of the most gorgeous views you'll see for quite some time. On top of that is the game well optimized and runs quite well on older hardware. The gameplay is well done and an improvement over for example The Witcher 3. They improved most of what the other games offered. Despite all of this high praise I can't recommend this game.
While it looks stunning, most places seem copy pasted with older assets and you soon realize that the impressive temples are all the same. Gameplay is largely improved over other AC games but the endless copy pasted question marks on the map offer little variety. You always infiltrate the same stronghold, encampment and warehouse. Soon the great fighting mechanics seem dull as the enemies are just damage absorbing sponges and if you dont skill and equip into the assassination tree you soon can't kill even a topless guy silently. Also you yourself become incredibly tanky later on making fights a slog for both sides. So they implemented fire and poison that will melt your life in no time to counteract your armor. The story starts of strong and gets good again in the later parts of the game but the midgame is a total slog. After 30 hours I could not take it anymore and had to quit. Months passed before I came back for a round 2. I finished chapter after chapter but once I reached a later part of the game I asked myself: Am I having fun playing this game?
I did not.
Its grindy (even after the patches),its repetitive and just a massive slog that you have to fight through to reach its ending(s).
Unless you really like doing task after task after task of the same stuff with no end in sight, it might be a game for you.
But I have too many other enjoyable games to waste my time on this, just to see the credits.

Very annoying about the way how Ubisoft is trying to promote its new DLC, every time you press ESC button, or map button, or tab button, any button to the menu. The DLC promotion will pop up and ruin the entire game experience. Can't even find a place to shut this down. Making me sick of this and turn of the game and come to here to write my review. Very disappointing.

Recommendation : Very High
Does this game worth the full price? YES!
Should you buy season pass as well? Indeed because it has Darius and Atlantis related stuff.
Is it a Copy/Paste of the AC Origins? NOPE.
Does it look better than the Origins? in 95% of the time yes.
How's the story? is it lame like most of the past games? It's amazing, has 3 separate story lines which intertwine in a beautiful manner. and no, It's not Lame.
Does the combat feels and plays better than Origins? YES YES YES. lots and lots of customization for combat, it's really great.
is customization as good as Unity? Almost on par with it.
Alexios or Kassandra? Kassandra.
End Game content? Lots of it.
Overall score : 10/10

TL;DR : Odyssey is a very very great RPG game with good gameplay mechanics and great combat + a solid story line. you should definitely buy it.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey has a very confused identity. They go through great lengths to recreate incredible scenes from ancient Greece, and then they undercut the whole thing with cheap jokes, references, and modern-day politics. Some of the gameplay is fun, and some of the story moments are cool, but there's too much filler. Also, for an RPG, hardly any of your choices actually matter. Almost all of your decisions lead to the exact same dialogue, and the exact same results.

Also, the story is unfinished. You conclude nothing by the end, and are expected to buy the DLC if you actually want the story to lead anywhere. Very unsatisfying conclusion.

This is not a reaction to Valhalla going to Epic — Ubisoft has been doing that for a while. And I'd never fault a company for trying to make money, that IS, what they're in business to do. That being said, I've felt for a long time that Odyssey was missing something — I don't know what that something is, but I know I don't want to look for it any more.

If you don't want to read this whole thing — It says this: Origins is better, Odyssey seems to have missed the boat.

Origins has purpose, it's the first game to completely turn the series into a new direction and is a much better setting for a series that is essentially baked in conspiracy theories of history. Odyssey seems to taken 'sandbox' to heart and opened an entire world to explore. And to be fair, there is a TON to do, but it's all trite, banal and uninspired.

Ancient Egypt is rife with mystery. The delusional sense of paranoia that inspired the great pyramids to be created that extends into real life modern day with pyramids and triangles being imagery of the Illuminati. There is no telling how many stories could be told within that framework. Ancient Greece less so, not to mention all the other games that use the Greek mythos to provide a setting. In direct comparison, the ones set in Egypt are few and far between.

Everything you do is meaningless.
Spartan vs Athenian Conquest battles are pointless. You can not only repeat them in the same region, but you can change sides — this has no effect on the state of the world. They are essentially loot grind missions. I didn't touch on this before, but even if you're a completionist and simply need to clear all the things on the map — I cannot tell you the number of times I went into an outpost, killed the leaders and then had new leaders ready to replace them before I was done looting the place! They didn't even give me the satisfaction of having an empty outpost after killing everyone for a single minute!

The combat is less interesting — you are forced to use the broken spear with all weapon sets short of using a two handed weapon. Even stealth kills are less satisfying — regardless of whether you play as Kassandra or Alexios, you have to use the broken spear. (It that has significance to the narrative.) The spear glides through people in the animations and feels as though there is no resistance to their body. This is morbid, but you kill people in the game, that's what it's about. And when your actions don't feel significant it just adds to the feeling that your presence means nothing.

The mercenary system is as meaningless as the Nemesis system from “Shadow of... “— they come and go without much fanfare. You kill 'em or you don't. They come after you like police in GTA. They go away. Nothing changes. You kill the next one that takes their place. You'll gain prowess and will be placed into higher tier rankings of the mercenary system but this also has little meaning.

You can romance numerous people, which is cool. But aside from an initial quest, or in some cases, a set of quests, there is no significance to becoming a partner with them. Effectively making them one night stands. Which again, makes your presence feel trivial.

Kassandra has no agency of her own.
Juxtaposed to Bayak, a character, a being that has their own goals — Kassandra (or Alexios) bends to your will in every dialogue. Which is great! But what's the significance of Kassandra? Why not have a custom character? Let me truly be a proper 'Misthios'. It makes no sense. To me, it feels like Ubisoft took the core gameplay of Origins and stuck it in one of the most overused settings in games. Changing little beyond adrenaline being used for abilities and adding dialogue choices. (That in the large swathe of things, have negligible changes outside the immediate situation.)

There is no reason to hold extra types of weapons. Hunter, predator, warrior bows have been resigned to abilities that are activated with any bow provided you've enough adrenaline.

Skull & Bones.
Without a doubt the biggest improvement is the Adrestia. Allowing ship customization with crew management and assignment of leaders. Upgrades for hull armor and weapons from raw materials. All that stuff is great and I've no reason to see why those ideas won't be expanded upon in the upcoming Skull & Bones.

This part contains story spoilers:  — My point is that when you're playing as a character in a world, they should care about something, anything at all. And they don't. There aren't even skill checks for dialogue choices, you can just choose whatever dialogue option you want and it happens. So leveling and role playing aspects are also limited.

THE GIST:
They completely changed Assassin's Creed with Origins. With Odyssey, I feel like they built a shell of a game and stuck a bunch of placeholders in it. Then ran out of time and said, screw it, let other people make custom quests.

I think Odyssey is a stepping stone, a sort of testing ground for something else that doesn't exist yet. However, I don't think it's a great game. Not even really a good one. An interesting one, perhaps.

In all honesty, I'd prefer that Ubisoft let Assassin's Creed take a few development cycles off.

If you've read this far, consider following my curation — Station Argus

If you don't agree, that's fine. I'm aware I'm going against the grain. But I find little value in this as an overall product.

I am 42 years old. I do play games since the era of Diablo 1 and even beffore and this is one of the best games I did play in my life, ever. The world is stuning, doesnt feel generated and you just believe that you really are on some huge epic adventure. I don't see any minus I could mentioned right now (30 hours played) Its awesome game. I really love the Mercenary (bounty hunters) system, when they rush on every place where I am just giving hell to some enemies, to receive the reward on my head. They always drop some fantastic piece of gear :) I do like Witcher 3 very much, but I do enjoy AC Odyssey much more. The only think I do wish for AC Odyssey right now is coop. If this game is done like The Division, that you can play it with 2 - 6 people, that would be really masterpiece in my opinion. The possiblity to play this with my brothers, to sail one warship together, to be able to hunt legendary beasts in group, fight conquest battles side by side and attack the forts in commando style, that gives me goose bumps. I would fell like one of those hero dudes from movie Clash of the Titans :) Also the map seems to be huuuge, so we could live our own Oddysey for lots of hours :) This is after looong time first game I don't regret those 60 euros a bit. I am already decided to buy seasson pass and play this till my head don't blow up :) Awesome game!

I do recommend play it on exploration mode. Its much more fun and you will never really got lost, dont worry. All you need is use Ikaros to scan world from the sky and follow the ring target signaling Ikaros sees. If there is some important thing, the ring will appear and will somehow "pulse" as you are closer to that important object. This way you will really feel some connection with Ikaros like with your friend and guide. I still think he is God :)

PS: I dont mind about technical bugs, I speak only about how the game feels when I play it. I did have some tech problems, but they didnt prevent me in playing.

One of the greatest AC games. I got it for a 50% discount including the DLCs, and there is sooo much to do and too many missions. I am now past 300 hours at this game and I still have the DLCs and a few side missions to do. I havent even finished exploring all locations yet. The map is HUGE, in fact the largest map of any AC games out there

Strongly recommend getting this game

Before I begin; yes, the game is a bit grindy.

When I first booted the game, I was truely hyped up. I pre-ordered the gold edition just to play 3 days earlier because I just couldn't wait (I'll be hated for this, but AC is the only series I actually pre-order).

Upon first boot, I noticed some stuff I've seen before. They re-used assets from origins. You won't truely notice unless you've been playing origins a lot beforehand. The UI and some other aspects also feel the same as origins. Some may say it was due to the games being developed alongside each-other, however that's not an excuse. They could've at-least added some different graphics to some elements, or changed the looks of some stuff slightly; yet they did not.

I picked Kassandra as my main protagonist. The first few quests where you meet markos, and do quests for him didn't really exite me, and I sort-off disgusted the voice acting on that guy as well. However once you're done with him, the quests and voice acting get better.

The story has me hooked and the gameplay is really nice so far.

Decisions in quests... They are there, but for most side quests you don't really feel any impact. Example the plague quest:


The conquest system... It's nice and rewarding, but you don't really ever side with either the athens or the spartans. You're just there and you can decide who to help. You can't "pick" a faction so that they turn friendly towards you or give you any rpg like benefits. You just help, get rewarded, the winner takes control over the area and you walk off like usual. There's no reputation to build there. It has so much potential but it's just not done very well. Maybe future patches change this.

Sailing? One word; ♥♥♥♥ yeah. I'm in love with the open seas. Occasionally I come across a sunken temple, or hidden treasures. I can't explain how nice it is, although sometimes buggy when boarding ships. And when you board a ship while his friends are still around, they're like:" Oh hey the enemy is boarding one of our boats, let's wait for the commander to kill our friends and attack them again once they're done looting!" I know it makes sense from a game designs point of view, because otherwise you wouldn't have enough time to loot a ship.


Cultists and mercenaries... I love this mechanic. The mercenaries are a pain unless you play it smart and take out the person that put the bounty on you. If you got no bounty, you'll see known mercenaries on the map but they won't do anything to you. You can still take them out if you wish.

Uncovering cultists is a fun aspect as well. You need to find clues, and once you have enough, you may uncover a cultist and hunt them down. Rewards varie but it's mostly legendary gear.

All in all, I'll give it a 8.5/10 because it does so much good, but there's still room for improvement. It's worth your money.

I'll most likely update this after some time and I did more stuff, but for now this is my review :>

Assassin's Creed evolving to Action RPG. And that's a great thing.

I love it that you can pick male and female character here.... Kassandra is Perfect :)

This game has better Skill sets than AC Origins, so many cool abilties that you want to unlock ASAP.

And yeah...the RPG element is great as well, I love the new direction of Assassin's Creed franchise now.

CAN'T WAIT FOR Assassin's Creed IN JAPAN!!!!

This game is one of the most story-rich games I have ever played. It is very long; some are not fans of the length of this game, but I am because it feels as if there is a million new adventures to explore throughout and after you complete the main story. Also, the historicity around this game with the Peloponnesian War delights me very much, and makes me wanna continue to explore the history of Sparta and Athens during this time, as well as the polytheistic culture behind it. I definitely recommend this to everybody!

Although I wish we could go back to the days where we get a 30-40 hr game with a good story I understand that's not how money is made. There's too much to do. The map is too big. I will never finish this game, but I have fun coming back to it every few months to needlessly kill anything I can stick my daggers into.

There's a lot here to digest and if you have the time for it, I'd recommend. If you want something you can play and beat and move on to the next game you are going to continuously be asking yourself, "when will this end?" It won't.

Don't care for the Assassin's Creed formula? Like open-world RPGs and exploration? Interested in Greek culture and mythology? Then you'll enjoy this game.

That being said it isn't perfect. I've encounter many minor visual/animation bugs during my 90 hours of play. Nothing serious, but it can be immersion breaking. The lack of a serious relationship system is a little annoying as well - you just sorta sleep around and never settle down.

The biggest complaint I see is with the microtransactions. My feeling on the matter is that if you are comfortable and familiar with playing open-world RPGs then you won't even consider using them and they won't be an issue. This was the experience I had and I never thought they were necessary and therefore not an issue. HOWEVER: if you don't typically play these sorts of RPGs and are coming in as a fan of the Assassin's Creed series, then these microtransactions seem like an easy solution to having to play for a extended period of time. Personally, I don't think microtransactions should be in any singleplayer experience, but I also believe you can easily avoid these if you just play all the game has to offer including exploration, side missions, and mini-boss battles. If you participate in all of that, you should level up naturally.

All-in-all, a fun but flawed experience. Interested to see where they take the series in the future.

Well, Ubisoft does ubisong things.
The game is unecessarly grindy, but fear not, you can buy a pack with real money to make it less grindy. You want to display more information on your map to make the game easier? No problem, a bit more money and you can do that. You want more rare items? No problem, just give Ubi more cash. Now with Ubisoft, get all the pay2win effect in a full price AAA game.
Beside that, after two years, you still find bugs, the controls are sometimes messy (in particular while climbing), and some quests are broken.
The game is not bad in itself, the main issue is that it was developed with greed in mind.

Try to open the map and oh look AN AD POPS UP. Worst marketing tactic ever Ubisoft you just lost a customer for good; and I am guessing that I won't be the only one. I definitely would have bought the DLC (in my own time when I choose to buy it, not when I am being forced to).... but seeing as buying it is the only way to not have to close a popup ad every time I try to get to the in-game menu, or the in-game map, then I will absolutely not buy the force fed DLC and am really close to saying boycotting Ubisoft from this point on. Because this is a line that no company should cross. If this was a free to play game then maybe.... but when you advertise like this in a AAA long time franchise game such as Assassin's Creed, that most players have paid $60 already to even be playing it, you are asking for a negative response.

Malaka,

Re-live the life of the demi-god, the Eagle Bearing Misthios, living in the time of great war b/w Athens and Sparta, with his/her non-human companions Ikaros and Phobos, with pals Markos, Pheobie and Brasidas to help you find your family and fight off the Cult.
Discover the Isu and their artifacts, enjoy spartan kicking enemies off the ledges and towers.


+ This game is gorgeous, both the ancient Greece and Kassandra. You can simply stroll and enjoy in the world with game's music, can even relax while enjoying.

+ Graphics, Sound, Music are just fantastic.
+ Combat system, abilities are fun, but i loved original 1 hit assassination kill in old games.
+ Story is a good but not that great.
+ Character voicing and modelling was damn fine, great choice getting Melissanthi Mahut as Kassandra and Michael Antonakos as Alexios.
+ Alkebedias and Sokrates were too much to handle many times but you will grow fond of them.
+ wide romance options, i bet half of the Greece had some STD or atleast the misthios did.



- Side Quests were a pain in the underworld of misthios, quests ranging from fetching groceries to magical water and even a dil-do.
- Level Scaled Enemies, like how TF a dog is a level 80, was he doing bench-presses.
- Layla Hassan, idk who she is and whats going on in present time.


DLC:

Legacy of the blade - was good with your misthios sleeping with your grandfather's enemies.
Fate of Atlantis - better story than other DLC, beauty ranged from the fields of Elysium, Underworld to Atlantis, JUST BEAUTIFUL, gave good lessons to our misthios.


TL;DR: Just Bring Back the Assassination Kill. Loved Ancient Greece and Spartan kicking,
Kassandra is Love so is Alexios. WTF is going on in present day.


Chaire.

I finally finished AC Odyssey and all its DLCs, so it's time to write a (spoiler-free!) review.
I'd heard mixed things about this game, so I was reluctant to play it at first. Lucky for me, I got a taste during its free weekend a few months ago and immediately got hooked. I got the Ultimate Edition on sale. 230 hours later, here's all you need to know about Odyssey. In order: Story and Quests, World and Graphics, Gameplay and Combat, DLCs and what edition you should get.

Story and Quests

Odyssey is set in Ancient Greece during the Peloponnesian War, a conflict between the city-states of Sparta and Athens. You play as an ex-Spartan, exiled from their home due to breaking the national law as a child. Separated from your family, you grow up on the island of Kephallonia and are raised to be a misthios or mercenary. You eventually leave to explore the rest of the Greek world and search for your family, uncovering a great conspiracy. You can choose between a male or female character, but this choice will not affect your opportunities or the way you are treated in the game.

The campaign will give you roughly 80 hours of content. I personally found Odyssey's storyline to be really interesting - it didn't have the annoying anger and vengeance of earlier AC titles and I think it is really well-paced. You meet and befriend a variety of characters including famous historical figures like Socrates, Pericles, Aristophanes, Euripides, Lysander and so on. Something I quite liked is that these characters have lines which are actual, real-life quotes, and any ancient history nerd like me will be ecstatic over this. I admit that I predicted many of the major plot-twists so they aren't exactly revolutionary, but this didn't take away from my experience. What I was really surprised about is that your choices actually really affect the story - it's not at all linear! I found that this really added to immersion, and the game also has its fair share of moral dilemmas.

Odyssey is absolutely full of side quests and bounties. Many of them are entertaining and there is a good range from short to long side missions. Unfortunately, Ubisoft remains as per usual pretty formulaic and many missions are fetch quests or based only on killing someone/something. Despite this, it's still pretty easy to find enjoyment in completing them.

World and Graphics

The graphics in Odyssey are completely mesmerising. You could honestly buy the game just to explore and take screenshots and it would probably be worth it. The game has a great photo mode, too. As far as I know, you don't need incredibly high specs for it to look very pretty either; I played on mostly medium settings and was very impressed.

Content-wise, the world has an overwhelming amount of locations to complete, each with its own set of objectives. Anyone who completes the game 100% deserves to be called a demigod. The world is massive, with tons of regions to explore. There's a variety of location types, ranging from military camps to caves and forts. Generally, there's always something to do.

When it comes to historical accuracy, I was actually pretty impressed. I think Ubisoft really did make an effort to research the time period and the game is full of cool details. For example, the sea shanties are all original Greek poems from 2+ millennia ago. There are also historical locations with extra info, but this is only accessible on the map and I actually wasn't aware of this function until halfway through the game because it's not emphasised at all. The main point of inaccuracy I can point out is that there is a bit too much equality for the time period (which was very, very sexist and racist)... but hey, it's historical fiction for a reason.

Gameplay and Combat

The main thing to say here is that Odyssey isn't really an Assassin's Creed game. There are a variety of difficulty levels to choose from, but there is far less emphasis on stealth than in previous titles. A big criticism from many is that the one-shot assassination kill mechanic is NOT in the game, and that is honestly kind of annoying. You can still choose to play stealthily, of course, but Odyssey is not a stealth-based game. Instead of the Eagle Vision sixth sense, you have an eagle that you can take control of to scout locations.

However, Odyssey is a brilliant historical RPG in every other sense. There are 3 skill trees which you can upgrade as you level up, which all have cool and useful abilities to diversify and customise your gameplay. The melee combat is really fun and you can choose between a variety of weapon types like daggers, spears and staffs alongside a bow. All weapons and armour have different perks and come in different levels of rarity. This gives you the freedom to choose your playstyle.

There are also other cool combat mechanics. You get to command your own ship (which you can upgrade throughout the game) and engage in naval combat. There are other mercenaries who can be hired to kill you when you commit illegal actions; this mechanic is comparable to Shadow of Mordor's nemesis system. There are bosses from a variety of Greek myths and legends, including legendary animals. There are also conquest battles where you can join the fight between Athenian and Spartan forces, though participation unfortunately has no real effect on the development of the war plot or how your character is treated by NPCs.

As a side note, your ship, weapons and armour are all visually customizable. Though this isn't major, I think it adds to the aesthetics of the game and is nice to have.

Secrets of Greece DLC

This DLC is included in the season pass. Unfortunately, there isn't much to say about it. It basically adds a few more normal side quests, which are all fairly standard.

Legacy of the First Blade DLC

This DLC is split up into 3 chapters which are all included in the season pass or can be bought separately. I quite liked this DLC - it has an interesting story and builds on existing mechanics. It gives you a lot to do in regions that are otherwise lacking in quest content. It also adds enemies, including a ton of new bosses and cool new enemy types with new designs. The DLC also adds 3 new abilities alongside a new ship function, all of which I personally thought were quite useful and fun.

The Legacy of the First Blade DLC is great for AC lore fans as it explores the origins of the Templar/Assassin divide. It has some memorable characters and is overall quite enjoyable, but I wouldn't say it blew me away.

Fate of Atlantis DLC

This DLC is also split into 3 chapters which are included in the season pass or can be bought separately. I have to say, I LOVED this DLC. It has a brilliant story with absolute tons to do, exploring new AC lore and adding a fantasy element to the game. It adds 3 new worlds to explore, which are all full of unique locations and have distinct designs and charm. I was really impressed with each of the worlds. The DLC also adds HEAPS of gameplay extensions, allowing you to unlock ability "enhancements" (optional modifications for skills) that can really change how you play and it gives you lots of easily gained ability points. There are really interesting new enemy types and a lot of new gear. The DLC is mythology-centered and you get to meet interesting figures like Adonis and fight heroes like Herakles and Achilles.

The Fate of Atlantis is an expansion I'd recommend to all players. It adds tons of new content and is really impressive.

Conclusion

Rating: 8/10

I recommend the Gold Edition. Deluxe/Ultimate just come with a bit of extra customisation items and boosters. I really liked this game, but know what you're buying: it's a fantastic historical RPG, but not what you'd expect from an AC stealth-based game. It can be repetitive but it has a gorgeous world with hours of content.

This version of Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a much needed gaming diversion...after 5 years and 3000 hrs of near exclusive Unloved gaming, Odyssey may have broken my addiction. The blend of Ancient Greek Mythology and its God-Like characters, combined with the outstanding open world sand box graphics, fighting skills, and weapons upgrades, makes this version of the Assassin's Creed Series a standout and must own....

It pains me to not be able to recommend this game

TL; DR:
AC Odyssey is gorgeous, has entertaining combat, and can easily keep you busy for over 100 hours with all there is to do in the enormous and lovingly crafted open world. This game is absolutely hamstrung by a story that falls apart a quarter of the way through due to the devs' decision to try to make a branching narrative that can be engaged with at any point during your playthrough, and player confidence is destroyed by questionable microtransactions.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is one of the better games I've played in years. On paper, this game sounds like it should be in the running for best game of the last decade, as it features a HUGE and meticulously detailed open world with breathtaking sights and places to discover, a branching narrative with meaningful choices that does not impede the player's ability to engage with the world however they like, fully voiced interactions with NPCs amounting to thousands of lines of recorded dialogue, and the freedom to craft a play style that the player enjoys and can change at any time consequence free. The unfortunate reality of AC Odyssey's situation, however, is that the game breaks down beyond the first 15 hours into a barely coherent slough through endless quests, useless gear, and a story that, at best, makes no sense, and at worst, is hilariously poorly written.

To understand why the rest of the game is so bad, we need to understand what makes the first 25% of the game so good. As an overarching statement, the combat in this game is fun and satisfying to master. If you are coming from older AC titles, then you will need to throw most of your previous knowledge about combat and button mapping out the window. The new combat system is great once you get used to it, and that contributed heavily to my desire to see the story through to the end. The opening section introduces you masterfully to the core mechanics of the game by having you immediately make decisions that effect the future, explore points of interest on the map, and tackle problems in the ways you deem are best. Kephallonia, the starting island, benefits greatly from not having to be relevant for the rest of the game. You are free to explore the emotional and engaging backstory of the main character while simultaneously forging your own path forward, all the while uncovering the mysteries of your childhood.

After Kephallonia you will have essentially graduated from the tutorial section of the game and be guided by the story to Phokis. The events that take place here are some of the best in the game. In Phokis you will make unlikely allies, be introduced to the larger central narrative threads, and make a few weighty decisions that will have a lasting effect on your game, and that resolve plots opened up on Kephallonia. Exploring Phokis will also reward you with engaging side quests and beautiful scenery. By the time you end your journey in Phokis you will have had a taste of everything the game has to offer, from ship combat and large-scale warfare to espionage and betrayal. All the great moments up to this point are facilitated by the strong and mostly linear story gently guiding you from plot point to plot point. Beyond Phokis, however, is where the game loosens up and allows you to explore the open world. Unfortunately, this is also when ACO begins to decline in quality. Once the foundation of the linear story is lost, most everything that happens starts to seem much more ambiguous and manic.

By the time you get to Athens, it seems all semblance of a realistic story is thrown out the window and characters from the past start to show up inexplicably. You are introduced to cavalcade of famous figures from Greek history, which is no departure for the Assassin's Creed franchise, however having all of the characters that you will befriend be people who you'd know from high school history class makes the characters introduced for the sake of the story, I.E. the expendable characters, really very obvious. That prior point is a minor complaint, as there are some pretty significant (and painfully stupid) subversions of those expectations later on in the game, but some of the foreshadowing becomes so obvious by this point that you would have to completely stop paying attention to the story in order to derive any kind of surprise from it. After Athens the game completely comes unhinged. You are left with a choice to do 3 tasks in any order you see fit. All 3 of these tasks are mindless busy work and do next to nothing to advance the story until they are all completed. One of the tasks involves earning 50,000 Drachmae, the in-game currency. While this is not an egregious example of gating since the character that gives you this quest also gives you a handful of quests that will earn you that much in a pretty manageable amount of time, it's important now that we talk about the other underlying problem with Assassin's Creed Odyssey; Mercenaries and Microtransactions.

Until now I have avoided talking about one of the major systems in ACO, that being the Mercenary/Bounty Hunter system. If you are familiar with the Middle Earth: Shadows series, you are no doubt familiar with the Nemesis System. The Nemesis System is a unique process by which elite named enemies are infinitely procedurally generated with personality quirks, strengths, and weaknesses. Assassin's Creed Odyssey implements a watered-down version of the Nemesis System to be used by the rival mercenaries. Rival mercenaries become Bounty Hunters when you commit "crime." These crimes range from slaughtering entire cities (which obviously constitutes crime) to attacking faction strongholds and looting chests (which is often necessary for progression). Similar to the star system in Grand Theft Auto, word of your misdeeds builds up on a meter on the bottom right of the screen, and eventually bounty hunters will be sent to try and kill you. These bounty hunters range in difficulty from minor annoyance to progression brick walls, and can attack you at any time, even during boss fights. One way to lose notoriety is to spend drachmae, which can be purchased with real money from the premium store. This isn't the only money sink, as gear and ship parts will need to be regularly upgraded for exorbitant costs.

ACO suffers pretty dramatically from the Fallout 4 and Mass Effect 3 style of dialogue selection, which is to say that the option you choose may sound great as a one sentence summary, but when your character starts to speak they can often say the opposite of what you intended. A good number of heavy narrative choices come down to a "pick one of three" style of dialogue options. And while there isn't a Paragon and Renegade type system that keeps track of how naughty or nice you've been, there are clear options in most situations for kind, mean, and indifferent. The story is very obviously trying to be a Greek tragedy, so having the main character say things that are flawed and that aren't the best way to diffuse a situation is in keeping with the theme, however there is little more frustrating that picking what SOUNDS like the neutral option, only for it to actually be the evil option. To circumvent this the game provides icons near some dialogue choices to show you what the outcome of selecting a specific action will be, however in certain situations these icons are still misleading and sometimes completely seem to contradict the summary sentence. This means your character will often say things that sound completely ridiculous in the current context, and you will often be left to guess which one of the options will have your character give the response you truly want them to. In an experience where player choice and narrative freedom are key game play pillars this is a gross oversight, and directly contributes to the terrible experience that is the main story.

It seems I've hit the character limit.

So , after 122 hours invested I can say I do enjoy it. In all this time I have not maxed the ship (the last levels costs to much but I like it) , haven't started the dlc story and have completed about 85% of the whole locations completion .

For those that don't want to read much:

Gameplay 9/10
Graphics 10/10
Story 7/10
Replay worth 5/10
Chickens are evil in this game too.

More in depth:

As for gameplay , it feels strong. What I mean is , you get the level perks you get to swap them anytime you want with very low cost and completely change your playstyle and you can change the equipment maybe upgrade it and have a completely new character with the same face. To top it off , after some update they added mastery levels ,which I honestly love . Those little increments in the percentages are what drives some of us and they know it.

On the difficulty section , some people say it is easy. In my experience levels balance the game . While the enemies have levels they also have some short of job , so while you can kill an archer with 0 effort a captain Strategos may keep you busy and the mercenaries might kill you in only two hits if you are not careful and a little under their level on harder difficulties.

The game keeps updating often , not much time ago they raised the level cap added a side story quest a skill and a dlc story episode. Though they lessened the drachmae and resources you get , the new ship upgrades are just an overkill in my opinion so not much changed hurting only the upgrade system for the gear. They also added an NG+ but not much chance of me doing all that once more. Not many single player games have such updates .

The graphics are beautiful and also not to demanding . I have an 8 year old pc and the game runs smooth on 60 fps while maintaining a lot of the game's beauty. Though every setting on my graphics is low and 720p resolution , the fact that the game runs smooth is a quality I admire.

The world has many authentic characters , you get to know them well enough through the game . Ok it doesn't have the character depth of The Witcher , so you bond but not to much with them , still a great upgrade from past AC titles. The map is very accurate , which I can judge since I am from Greece and went in game to find where my house would be (no chance doing that though).

The microtransactions in game are a bit annoying as we all know , but they are kept in a bare medium in this game. The in game shop consists of skins and time savers. The skins can be bought through in game currency that you get through daily and weekly bounties or from nodes while exploring (not to many of those though). Time savers I did not need , if I play a game for 120 hours it is meant to have some repetition but it is optional.

It has some faults but minor , like why do I have to look back in order to summon the horse in front of me?!?!?! The fire damage I inflict on enemies tends to hide the effects of unblockable attacks from my enemies . The elemental damage of enemies is a bit to much , making some playstyles a bit more difficult .

I recommend this game, but there's a lot I don't like about it. It's my first time playing an assassin's creed game, so I loved learning the mechanics for the first time. Exploring ancient Greece was really cool too. That said, the story sucks. By the time I got to the fight between me and "Big D" in a conquest battle (not naming to avoid spoiler), I was ready for the game to be over. But I wasn't a high enough level to beat the game so I had to grind for another 8-10 hours to complete it.

Pros:
- It's fun to see what Ancient Greece could have looked like
- Seeing mythical creatures from Greek mythology was fun for me
- The mechanics were awesome (for a first-time assassin's player)
- A lot of variety in game play: assassination jobs, conquest battles, naval battles, arena, human boss fights, and creature boss fights
- Some features make gameplay really convenient like telling your horse to follow the road so you can sit back and enjoy the scenery or the game giving you the option to switch quests to one nearby so you can knock more of them out faster


Cons:
- The "choices" in this game are immature. They usually split between "I'm cruel and want to say something mean" and "I'm nice so I'll say something comforting even if you're a scumbag." On top of that, they rarely change outcomes. When I was fighting "Big D" (not naming to avoid spoiler), I was given the option let live or not let live. I chose not to let them live, BUT guess what? Doesn't matter they live anyway. That's when I was over this game haha
- The story sucks. You're a mercenary taking contracts during war between Sparta and Athens. Cool, right? Except you don't really pick a side - you have to take quests for both sides. So you're prolonging the war just as much as the "Cult of Cosmos" is - the main enemy. While you slaughter countless people, the game also tries to paint you as some moral agent which is hilarious. The end of the Cult of Cosmos quest-line was dumb
- one of those stupid "gotchas" where they pick someone as the main secret villain that doesn't make any sense just so it's a surprise. And the end of the primary quest-line was anti-climactic - I won't spoil it, but I sat there thinking "that's it?" Maybe if you've played all the Assassin's Creed games it will be more meaningful to you, but I really didn't care about the extensive concluding conversations.

Funny:
- If you fight a bad guy near a civilian, the civilian might want to get in on the fight. Not sure why this happens, but you might have some random chick trying to stab you with a spear. If you fight back, the whole town comes at you. It was annoying at first until I realized how hilarious it was that all these randos were risking their lives for some mercenary I was fighting.
- Using the spartan kick ability to send enemies flying off cliffs never gets old. And they never learn. Just wait for the ability to refresh and one by one you can send every enemy to his death. /If only it worked on the bosses too...

Early in game quest I stole the Obsidian Eye from Cyclops - ran into him later and he was bullying a man for calling him Cyclops - so I showed him the eye and then stuck it in a goat's ass!! I then proceeded to kill him and his cohorts. When I was leaving town I ran into the goat and killed it and got the very valuable eye back!! 10 of 10 would definitely stick Cyclop's eye in a goat's ass again!!

What can I say that was not already said?
Pros and Cons for me:

+ No achievements based on difficulty level. I really appreciate that as someone who wants to enjoy the story and complete the achievements %100
+ Almost no missable achievements. (There's 2, 1 in DLC and one in main game related to romancing. You have to try really hard to miss them) Achievements are received by simply completing missions and exploring.
+ Skills are reassignable!
+Gorgeous environment. Work of art.

- Great game, yet, NOT an Assassin's Creed game. It's more like an RPG game that has assassination feature. No more "Ezio Collection" vibes. So little present day story. More repetitive.
- Not enough quick-travel spots. Horse gets glitchy.
-Horrendous publisher. Time Savers and Helix Credits. Really?!

I didn't want to write a review before 150 hours so after all this time I think Assassins creed Odyssey is just a good game; nothing more.
I remember when the game released I read some reviews that said this game is something like the witcher 3 and to me its just big funny joke. After 50 hours, the gameplay is just the same and has nothing more to show us, Level design is terrible and almost all of the main quest and side quest look like each other and you have to do lots of grinding to level up. The world of the game might be beautiful but its not alive and NPC's are just wandering around for no reason.
The most annoying thing about the game is optimization which is even worst than RDR2 (bugs are normal since its a ubisoft game).
and now at the end of my review I am asking myself that "Does this game worth 150 hours of my time?"

This game exhausted me and was a good reminder why I was avoiding Ubisoft games like a plague. I knew I should have stayed away with my motto: "Life is too short to play bad games."

I actually wanted to give it a somewhat positive score after the first episode of the first DLC and The Gates of Atlantis; however they went downhill as well and sadly the negatives outweigh the positives.

Positives:
+ Spectacular world design. I mean, I actually think there couldn't have been a better description of ancient Greece and historians agree as well. Art design and the team did amazing work.
+ Memorable historical characters such as Hippokrates, Socrates and Alkibiades. Particularly talking with Socrates is extraordinary.
+ Mythological creatures and hunting them feels wonderful. The last time we have seen these creatures in God of War and I think they did well design them and had much fun.
+ Kassandra's voice actress Melissanthi Mahut is sweet in her role. Swears well, sassy and angry enough to portray a character like Kassandra. Even though it felt off sometimes, it was definitely enough.
+ Armor and weapon designs are top notch. There are good combinations that fit each other and feels unique.
+ Ship fights are cool and one of the most fun elements of the game. I liked sailing around and the storms.
+ The Gates of Atlantis is a great DLC. Elysium looks spectacular. It's the predecessor of Immortals Fenyx Rising and you can see it from the moment you step into the world. Having conversations with the gods are wonderful, definitely feels like a different game apart from the filler content. Underworld is much better than Elysium (with a particular character's quest), and Atlantis is better than the Underworld.

Negatives:
- The world filled with pointless and non-immersive quests. Game feels empty in that regards because you cannot find an immersive quest even though Greece's itself is immersive. There are hundreds of question marks that are exact copy of one another and just there for filler content. I'd suggest you do the quests in this order: Golden marked story quests > Yellow/Blue/Brown Exclamation Marks > ignore the rest. Even in this format you can ignore a lot of the yellow ones because they're just empty and non-immersive.
- Main story ends so abruptly and in an unrealistic way. You find the person you chase the whole game in your dinner table. It's just lazy writing and even the DLCs are not enough to save the game.
- You care none of the characters because the game lacks of emotion. Oh, they died? OK. Oh, they're alive? OK. I just don't care enough because the game doesn't develop any of them enough for you to care about.
- Voice acting is literally bad. It's like anyone involved read the text without having the scene played in front of them and tried to imagine. It's robotic, soulless and just plain bad.
- Music is non-existent. I thought the main theme would play much longer and we see glimpses of past game's tunes but it's just generic. Even in the heat of the battle the music is not there so it makes everything anticlimactic.
- Enemies are sponge-like and they are always equal to your level. That makes your effort to become stronger pretty unnecessary but we all know Ubisoft did this to prolong your game time.
- Skill tree is just plain boring and you will start using only couple of them after sometime.
- Enemy and NPC variety is atrocious. You fight the same guy 100 times and see that old lady 200 times and the kid 300 times in your playthrough.
- Game forces you to do unnecessary quests to gain XP so you can continue your journey. Pretty scummy because they sell XP boosts and this leads to artificial extension of gametime, which is equal with boredom.
- The Cult starts good but fall off pretty quickly as it's the same and doesn't evolve to anything. Even in DLCs you get come Cult related stuff and it was the time I said "enough with this Cult ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥".
- Mercenary system starts promising but becomes an instant chore because they're everywhere and pain in the ass. Oh you killed someone? Some mercenary teleports to your location and put their nose to everything and create unnecessary chaos. They're irritating and overused.
- Too many Malakas.
- Stealth is useless whatever you do and upgrade your skill points. Kills the name of Assassin's Creed.
- Should have been released as a different IP and continue from there with Kassandra or Alexios. Would make much more sense.

There're probably more than I could remember because the game killed all my IQ with its boring gameplay. Go play Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3 couple of times instead of any Ubisoft games. Not recommended.

After 219 hours of azure beaches, virgin islands, Mediterranean cruising and of course assassinations, I'm glad to have Platinumed the game. The main story can be wrapped up in 30 hours, but its more fun when you go out exploring the Greek countryside and get to immerse yourself in the environs.

Comparing with AC Origins, it took me 146 hours to complete that game. But Odyssey is so vast that I still have a few '?' locations on the map and a few missions that I didn't want to follow up. Maybe I'll do them someday. Plus I haven't even talked about the DLCs that are HUGE maps by themselves. Just when I was getting bored with the primary map, I started 'Fate of Atlantis' and it opened up a whole new world. I enjoyed my time in Persephone's kingdom and when I was about to confront her, BOOM! The story totally changed with a whole new map!!

Continuing the comparison, Bayek had a better story and motivation than Alexios/Kassandra. Money was the only reason for Kassandra to become a mercenary. The initial story doesn't move much till she moves out in search for her family origins.

There is SO MUCH to do that you initially feel overwhelmed. But if you stick to the main storyline, you should be good. (Unless you need to upgrade your level to complete the next mission, then you can go on one of the numerous side quests that are available)

I liked the scripting for all the characters especially Sokratros and Akilibiades. Socrates annoying us with his philosophy which is in fact full of depth and Akilibiades using 'double-entendre' words to coax Kassandra into bed.

If it hadn't been for the variety in the places, locations, DLCs, I would have never been able to play for so many hours. But every time I reach a viewpoint and look around, the place looks heavenly and beautiful. I still feel like I can open the game and just pass through one of the Greek isles and spend an afternoon gazing at the waves on the beach and watch the ships passing along.

Time to become a Viking and conquer England... Valhalla!!

Pros
+ Soo many things to do (side quests, exploration etc)
+ Greek landscape is stunning to look at
+ Vast array of well written side quests
+ Excellent voice acting/motion capture performances
+ Even minor characters are unique and have depth
+ Excellent Soundtrack
+ Discovery tours for history lovers

Neutral
+/- Choices matter; doesn't fit the franchise IMO
+/- Talent specialization tree
+/- Tons of weapon types, but daggers are clearly the best

Cons
- Many "points of interest" are just copy and paste caves/camps
- Idiotic animal AI
- Ubisoft went full on RPG in this one (character+equipment stats)
- Level cap is too high at 99
- Gone are the days of sleek parkour introduced in Unity
- Warrior specialization is garbage

I absolutely love this game!!! One of the best games I have ever played.

This game is one of the biggest games I have ever played both in depth size and scale. Every character looks life like, you go to some of the cities in this game are beautifully done as well, so much to see. The buldings are built to perfection.

If you like Greek mythologies and a great story and great game and an epic adventure in everyway. The fights are brutal and also very well done you actually feel like in real fights to the death.

Definitely the best game in the whole Assassin's Creed series, it's almost impossible to stop playing this wonderful game I love it so much.

THIS IS SPARTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is Assassin's Creed Origins, but better & stronger however,ending up with minor nagging issues which are very different than Origins had at launch
There is so much to love in this game
Spartan Kick
The story (which is pretty tight so far)
The Greek Setting
The mountains and vistas
Those well known Landmarks and architecture
The Characters
Choices and Consequences 
Combat which is tighter than Origins
Naval Combat
"Pimp My Ship Simulator" inclusion
Kassandra's Story Arc 
Expansive Skill Tree
That HUGE Map

But its within those aspects that Odyssey finds its faults-
Legendary Gear locked behind Orichalcum - Swanky name for Microtransactions
Greek/spartan setting but main character missing a shield. What? Werent Spartans known for their shields and war formations?
Sometimes the Dialogue tree ventures into weirdly funny terrirtory. May end up undercutting a speciific moment.
Romance options are pretty weird to say the least, so far
Choice/Consequence dont have any game changing effect. They are just....."there". Thats all.
That map size will cause some serious exhaustion trying to 100% or anywhere close to it.
Weird camera angle movement when target lock moves about during Combat (carries over from AC:Origins)
Performance a litlle worse than Origins on Launch (I played from Early Access)

It may sound like nagging but hey, issues are issues. Apart from those small things on the top of my mind, this is a top notch game. It has kept me invested and interested so far, so definitely a Thumbs up for me.

Plays "Ok" on an RX 580/R5 1600 FPS drops upto 45 on a 1080p res but thats about it.

The short version:
One of the best games I've ever played.

The slightly longer version:
It is a huge game with many historically accurate details of the ancient Greece or at least way more historically accurate than any of the Hollywood movies despite having mythical creatures in it.
The map size may not be as large as games like the newer Just Cause games but it is much more populated and with way more things to do than many other open world games.
There are also many buildings that you can actually enter and with detailed decorations and furnitures.
The combat system is similar to the Origins with the main story being quite a bit longer or at least it feels that way which I personally think is great.
I mean a good game should be large enough and have enough content for the player to spend at least 50 hours or more without being too repetitive.
Some people say the game is grindy early on and punishes the low level players but personally I think it makes the game more exciting when being chased by mercenaries many levels higher and explore new areas with much tougher enemies and hostile wild animals because it encourages you to do more side quests and find new ways to kill high level enemies.
There are also multiple dialogue options with some affecting which ending you would get which is also great and reminds me of the Mass Effect trilogy and the newer Fallout games.
I don't usually care too much about music and songs in games but the soundtrack of this game is just amazing and perfectly matches the beautiful landscape and architecture.

THE ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY...
Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey is the video game equivalent of a canvas you might find in the Louvre: a masterpiece of game design, style, and story that should ABSOLUTELY be in your game library!

[➕] THE (MANY) POSITIVES
+ The WORLD. Ubisoft has done an *outstanding* job expanding the breadth and depth of their world with each new Assassin’s Creed game. Odyssey’s recreation of ancient Greece delivers yet another living, breathing, beautiful world that you’ll love exploring for hundreds of hours.

+ KASSANDRA. I only ended up playing as Kassandra during the story, but the voice actress and character were *outstanding!* I thoroughly enjoyed the character’s development, and some of the voice lines will truly live on forever.

+ The SIDE-CHARACTERS. Are fantastic! Characters like Barnabas, Phoibe, and Herodotus help drive the story and create some memorable story beats, while still others end up being some of the most interesting and compelling heroes and heroines in gaming!

+ BARNABAS! Basically the best sidekick!

+ SHIP COMBAT. Building from their experience with Black Flag and Origins, Odyssey has done excellent work creating engaging, exciting ship battles. Plus, you get to pretty up your ship along the way, which is a fun way to customize your experience!

+ The COMBAT. As always, Assassin’s Creed does a good job creating a fluid, energetic combat system. It can feel somewhat repetitive at moments—especially when fighting tougher enemies—but it’s enjoyable enough to see you through to the end of your journey! Plus: there is a *ton* of endgame leveling to do if you enjoy the game enough to continue into a New Game +.

+ Lots of time in the Animus. Ubisoft has done a good job of not forcing you out of the animus for extended periods of time in their recent games, which is nice. While you *will* end up dropping out a few times, you can usually hop back in within minutes if you so desire.

+ The MUSIC. Assassin’s Creed has always had a solid soundtrack, and Odyssey doesn’t disappoint. It’s hard enough to move along from the menu music alone, but the in-game ambiance does a great job of setting the mood at the most important moments.

Plus: THIS ABSOLUTELY *AMAZING* THEME SONG!

+ CUSTOMIZATION. Odyssey does a great job with customization options: letting you skin over your weapons and armor to fit your preferred look, and providing customization options for your horse (Phobos) and ship (the Adrestia). It’s well designed and gives you something interesting to pursue as you play.

+ KYRA. 

+ ELYSIUM. Part of The Fate of Atlantis DLC, the land of Elysium is *stunning.* 

[〰] THE..."TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT"
~ The STORY. I genuinely enjoyed the story, but it has one major drawback: 

~ The LEGACY OF THE FIRST BLADE DLC. Honestly, it doesn’t feel particularly meaningful to the larger picture… 

~ The UNDERWORLD and ATLANTIS. Don’t get me wrong: the level design of both areas is amazing and themed perfectly, but you’ll end up wanting to rush through the Underworld just to get to Atlantis... only to be disappointed in its repetitiveness. While it’s worth it to see the beauty of the level design, the story ultimately falls short in The Fate of Atlantis DLC.

~ ROMANCE. Admittedly, this ultimately comes down to preference. The problem is that they don’t really have any meaning (so you can take it or leave it without missing out on anything in the game), and the one that does have meaning to the story feels both forced and unwanted.

~ ARCHERY. Look…I love ranged play (genuinely). The problem is that the whole archery tree feels underpowered in comparison to melee and stealth. This may ultimately come down to your style of play, but it lacks the *oomph* that you'll find in Origins or other open-world RPG's.

~ ENGRAVING. A mechanic that feels like a solid system which didn’t quite play out as intended.

~ REPETITIVE SIDE QUESTS. While initially useful for some quick experience or cash, the random side quests will start to feel repetitive as you unlock more and more of the world. Fortunately, they aren’t required, but it's unfortunate that there eventually comes a time when you write them off.

~ NEW GAME +. Good for hardcore players, but I’m unsure if there's enough incentive to draw you into a new game plus... Perhaps it's worth a second playthrough with the opposite character, but ultimately it wasn't enough to draw me back in.

[➖] THE NOT-SO-GREAT
- PARRY. (How the mighty have fallen!) The timing to parry an attack is REALLY tight in the game, meaning you’re more likely to dodge in circles around your enemy instead. It’s kind of unfortunate to lose the mechanic...though more talented players might be able to get a better hang of it.

- SPARTA vs. ATHENS. This is the eternal question, and spoiler:  It’s really kind of a letdown in the big picture, and misses a mark that Origins lands with far more grace and ease!

- UN-LOOTABLE NODES. Part of your character's growth involves amassing stuff you gather from around the world. Unfortunately, there are a significant number of lootable nodes that spawn *just* outside the bounds of the world. While arguably trivial, it feels bad to scan an area only to reveal several points you’ll never be able to reach.

- The  This may come down to personal preference, but it was needlessly punishing, underwhelming mechanically, and is one of the only points that I had to step away from the game out of frustration.

[😍] THE FINAL WORD…
This game is well worth your time! It is visually stunning, will easily immerse you in the world for hundreds of hours, and provides a compelling story throughout. If you love the Assassin’s Creed series, it is well worth your time to give it a shot. If you don’t love the series, it’s worth picking up during a sale to see if it holds your interest for long enough to stick around!

All in all, it's a SOLID game. I (personally) prefer Origins, but they are similar enough that it ultimately comes down to your own preference!

⭐ OVERALL: 9/10

As far back as I can remember I always knew that I wanted to be a loose canon roaming the mean streets of ancient Greece. Finally my dreams have been made whole, I've decimated countless wrong doers in the name of justice, scoured the earthen and holy treasures while desecrating once sacred tombs and spat in the face of the gods themselves. This game is truly beautiful, incredibly expansive and will make you want to take up learning Greek.

If you look at my play time you will see that I played this game for 160 hours at the time of review, and I still do not recommend the game.

The reason for it is simple: the game is not fun and it took way too long for me to realize it, because it is kind of addictive.

Every mission consists out of an NPC talking to the player, the player searching for the place they have to go, then either
activating a chest to "get documents / get a weapon / get a trinket / get a map / ..."
killing "the polemarch / the commander / the leader / ..."
or freeing "the rebels / the friends / the husband / the family / ..."
Then you go back to the first NPC and get your rewards. And even though the things above sound different - most of the time I did them all anyway.
I activated every chest to get equipment and money, and also to "be done" with the place (there are "location objectives" at every more or less significant location and you have to kill the leading persons, open every chest, burn war supplies and sometimes find a stone plate of some sort).
I killed most of the people anyway, because it's annoying if they see you and suddenly the whole world wants to find and kill you
freeing the people is also "location objective"
Sometimes this is spiced up by making you run around in circles in a defined area to "look for clues" which are marked by a magnifying glass.
Those are the standard missions. Then there are the "big enemy" missions. They sound different at first, but they are all the same.

In the course of the game some standard missions (see above) derive into "big enemy" missions, in which you have to fight and kill some kind of boss enemy. That can be an abnormally strong animal, another mercenary, a pit fighter or some sort of cultist. The only different thing with that are the cultists - sometimes you have to think about where to find the cultists but in order to get to them you have to do several "standard missions", and then kill the cultist.

Yeah and you have naval battles with arrows and javelins. And big fights between Athens and Sparta with you fighting for one side.

So in conclusion there are maybe 3-4 things you do in the game over and over and over and over again. This is then made harder by having you grind ressources to upgrade your weapons to stay stronger than the enemies, grind XP to get abilities, and so on.

And that's the addictive part.
The abilities are nice to have, they are powerful and if used correctly they make the player a god among men.
The equipment has various modifiers which make you even stronger, depending on your playstyle.
There are several tiers of weapons, with the "legendary" weapons being unique and unremoveable once acquired (you can put them into storage but they're never "deleted", which is good).
There is a list of mercenaries being better (higher leveled) than the player, and it's natural that the player wants to be on top of that list.
There is a list of cultists who "are evil" and it's natural that the player wants to fight evil and kill every one of those cultists.
The map is full of quests which are automatically generated and repeat themselves again and again, there is no way to finish all the quests. And even the quests which are not automatically generated (they are golden) still follow the same basic principle ("standard missions" / "big enemy" missions).
There is a list of big animals
There is a list of big fighters,
There is a list of mystic whatevers
Here a list, there a list, and you're basically having several "to do" lists that you work from top to bottom.
And that's not fun. That is chores and if I wanted to do that, I could clean the kitchen or the bathroom and actually get things done instead of wasting my time in this game.

Additionally to that, all the "cool assassin" stuff from the games is gone. The present time sequences are neither informative nor in any way interesting. The characters are shallow and I don't care if they die or don't, on which side they are on, if they're male, female, trans or whatever. The part of "The Assassins" versus "The Templars" is completely gone in the games, you have the "bad ones" and a few "good ones", and both are somehow organizing themselves, sometimes with a structure / organisation but not like in the old games. There is no "we" feeling in the game, the player is not part of a secret underground organisation who tries to fight another secret underground organisation. You just stumble from one fight to another. There is no creed in this Assassin's Creed and the player isn't even an Assassin anymore. At least not the kind of ninja stealthy assassin that goes around completely unseen, which was possible in games earlier than Origins, but changed with the new fighting system.

When you see an enemy who chills at a cliff, and you sneak to them, you don't know if you're able to kill them or not. You have a spear that you can basically put through their throat but it may only take a third of the enemie's health. But you only know that when you're directly behind them, because then the game knows what you want to do and it shows how much of their health you take. In most cases you are forced to either sneak around completely unseen or to engage in open combat. There is a LOT of open combat in this game, and it's not like in earlier AC games, where you counter 2 times and be done with the enemy. They're actually fighting back as good as they can and it's a challenge you're forced into again and again.

There is also an ingame shop where you can buy even more precious equipment with a special ingame currency that you *can* get, if you grind it (per week there is a set amount of special missions that give you a set amount of that special ingame currency) or you can buy it with real money, of course.

Yeah. That's it from me, I'm done with Assassin's Creed. I finished the main story, I started the Legacy of the First Blade dlc and saw it's the same like the main story but with different characters. It's not fun when you think "Oh god I'm finally done with this.."

I'm done now. Thank Athena.

This game is amazing and has one of the best campaign ever in my opinion. I finished a lot of campaigns like The Witchers series, Mafia series, GTA series, Skryrim and more but this one is my favorite!

Graphics are astonishing! Gameplay is smooth and the combat system is not extremely easy like the other AC's before.

I finished the game and bought DLC's but I still want more! Can't get enough of the Ancient Greece!

A wonderful game.

I was really skeptical at first, thinking it would just be a retextured version of AC: Origins.
But this game... This game really took me by surprise.

The mechanics are really well-made, the gameplay is balanced for the most part.
And the progression feels natural.

The storyline is awesome and you can take shortcuts and do your own thing at any time.

Conclusion: Definitely my favourite Assasin's Creed game now, even the first game I ever bought a season pass (which I can also recommend) for.

I wish there is a "Mixed" or "Neutral" for review, because I have mixed feeling about this game.

IS THIS A GOOD RPG GAME?
The answer is yes, this is a rich, well made RPG game, in some degree even better than Witcher 3(which is my favorite). The environment itself is incredible, the mountains, the buildings and cities. Also it has ship battles which is one of my favorite thing to do when I travel on sea. However the quests can be boring sometimes, a lot of them just tell you to kill this and kill that but I guess that is inevitable for RPG games.

now for this question:
IS THIS A GOOD ASSASSIN'S CREED GAME?
The answer is, no. It is not a good assassin's creed game. You see they took away some of the key part of the assassin's creed series. The most obvious is the assassinate, in previous AC, assassinate are one shot to any enemies(i dont know about AC Origin cuz i didnt play it), but since they added RPG elements to the game, they cannot have enemies just get one shot by a stealth kill, therefore took away what makes AC fun in the first place. For example, an important character in the story that you have to assassinate but he is 1 level above you or same level, you cannot one shot the target regardless how sneaky you are, he will just get stabbed and get back up and start attacking you like nothing happened. Also the feeling of you killing a key character is very unsatisfying, previous AC, killing a key character gives a little cutscene, for this game, nope. Those cultists you killed means very little to the story and the only purpose they serve is to give you doritos to upgrade your spear, after you took them down just shows: "congrats they are dead, here is your doritos."
Lastly of course the microtransactions... seriously Ubisoft? you gonna sell us XP boosts in a SINGLE PLAYER game?! and those cool outfits cost 6-10 bucks? remember this is a SINGLE PLAYER game, it does not offer any multiplayer content. XP boost and gold boost is just dumb and greedy, what is this? Warframe? I still have hope in you, Ubisoft, you are one of the good AAA company these days, but this ♥♥♥♥ just makes me sad pls dont go full EA.

Ubisoft has patched in support for ono-AVX cards, so I am changing my review to recommended. I appreciate the work the Ubisoft team did to bring us this patch. In the future maybe they will fix this issue before release.

Leaving my old review for posterity.
















Absolute garbage that Ubisoft CHANGED the requirements 2 days before release because they forgot to tell us that the game requires AVX capable processors. Origins had no such requirement, and ran fine on non-AVX processors. 2 of their previous games also had this issue, and it was fixed with a patch. This time? Ubi says they have no plans to patch. 100% refund.

EDIT: Leaving original review as is so you can see it. Ubisoft has suggested that they are working to posibly patch AVX support. I would like them to explain why their official response on release was "we are not planning any patch for AVX". Did they really think people would not be angry? Anyways, if they patch AVX i will change the review.

For those who say its my fault for having an old computer, you are right, i cant afford to upgrade. Realize that upgrading a 1st gen i5 means a new mobo, ram, and probably case. Ive looked into it its about $500 CAN. My comp ran Origins and many other recent games perfectly fine, so I am right to assume that it will run Odyssey fine. Its still on Ubi for not telling us when they ran into the same issue on release of Crew 2.

In the beginning, this game is amazing.

I wanted to love it so bad and I was so determined to finish, but after finishing the main questline and realizing that I still have like 20 more hours of repetitive grinding left for the /other/ two cultist and artifact questlines that are all level gated and are actually part of the real ending... I give up. I hate saying that because Kassandra, the environment and art, and the first 10 hours or so were consistently exciting. But I cannot bring myself to slog through any more terrible voice acting and boring writing. If this game was condensed significantly and paced appropriately it would have been so good. This seems to be a common complaint, and hopefully Ubisoft learns from this in the future.

If you are fine with 100+ hours of grinding and love this setting, then maybe it's for you. But there's other games out there and I won't spend any more time on this.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is another beautiful gem in the Assassin's Creed franchise. Kassandra is an excellent female protagonist in the series, both strong & beautiful.

Pros:
+Excellent Graphics. Ancient Greece simply looks stunning in all its grandeur. The epic landscape makes for a screenshot lovers paradise.
+Excellent Story. The story while set in an epic world manages to remain very human and emotional at times.
+Excellent Combat. The combat system builds on certain aspects of its predecessor Assassin's Creed Origins allowing for satisfying combat when chaining together moves or executing enemies. The skill tree is also well implemented to keep combat fresh & rewarding.
+Great Controls. The game's controls are very responsive and helps to compliment combat system allowing for a great experience.
+Excellent orchestral soundtrack which truly complements the game's rendition of ancient Greece.
+Excellent voice-over work for all the main characters. (Melissanthi Mahut truly brings the character of Kassandra to life).


Cons:
-Poor dialogue choices at times throughout the game felt somewhat unnecessary, would have loved to have some better options to choose from.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey lives up to its namesake. By fully investing in becoming an action RPG, Odyssey's characters, combat, story, and scope are beyond anything the series has accomplished so far. Its ambitions might get the better of it sometimes, like in how it divides its story moments or in how the leveling system can get out of hand, but the overall experience is, simply put, epic. Even when the game's pacing hits a speed bump, there are plenty of engaging and rewarding side quests and distractions to keep you busy.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey takes place in the 5th century BCE. during the Peloponnesian war, i.e. the conflict between Sparta and Athens over control of all Greece.
AC Odyssey is so much better than the storyline in Origins. The Odyssey is full of secrets to discover about your own past and know your destiny captivates from the very beginning. War is only a background here, or rather a means to the truth. It is not an outstanding storyline-winning script, but it fits perfectly with the series and fantastically justifies a journey through the ancient world.
A nicely-written story is highlighted by very well inscribed historical figures.
Each of the eminent Greeks has a small thread consisting of several tasks based on their professions and achievements. Socrates entrusts us with tasks in which we must decide whether to be guided by logic, morality or empathy.
Alkibiades tempts you to take part in his controversial games, and Hippocrates introduces you to the secrets of medicine, then treated as turning away from the gods.

Everything we have seen in Origins was included in the Odyssey. The Eagle Sen was replaced by Ikaros, the tombs of the pharaohs gave way to buildings in honor of the Olympic gods, and the endless desert turned into the Mediterranean basin. Layla Hassan returns on a very modest contemporary thread with Dr. Victoria Bibeau as her partner.

For the first time in the long history of the series, we can choose a character between Alexios or Cassandra to enjoy the story with.
-- We can't change characters later during the game --

When starting the game, in addition to the gender and difficulty level of the hero, we choose one of the two game modes.
In the exploration mode that I myself recommend, instead of a large dot on the map saying "Here's the guy you need to send to the other side", we get a hint about the location of the quest objective. Usually, these are three pieces of information, thanks to which we will narrow the circle of research. The information is easy to decode, because in addition to the name of the island, it also gives the direction from its characteristic points.

The skills that we unlock and assign to shortcuts on the pad make the difference. The skills themselves may not be many, but they fit well with the gameplay and add dynamics to the clashes. In addition to the Spartan kick, there was stunning many enemies, covering with poison, setting weapons on fire, battle frenzy, knocking down the shield, and even taming animals. In addition, opponents no longer wait in a queue for bareback, but attack in groups from all sides. True, chaos does creep in, but it's a good change anyway!

How you perceive the "AC Odyssey" is largely determined by the question of taste. Some will love naval battles and larger-scale duels, others will get bored the second time.
Some people will be delighted with the amount of activity on the map, others will find that the sandbox formula tires them a bit.

Overall.
Odyssey is an almost perfect champion of its genre and one of the best parts of the game series. It ​does not revolutionize the franchise, but it's a capable entry that will satisfy fans for dozens and dozens of hours.

Pros.
+ Ancient Greece is big, bold and beautiful.
+ Combat and exploration habitually encourage experimentation.
+ Kassandra and Alexios are a great duo of protagonists.
+ A world that keeps on providing.

Cons.
- Gets repititive.
- Little grindy sometimes.
- Core narrative is underwhelming at times.
- Slow pacing that can make playing the huge campaign a drag.

It may not be a story that we would compare to the Homeric epic in terms of epic adventure, but it does not lack spectacular views, historical places and characters, and plenty of opportunities to duel on land and sea.
The best part of the series and definitely worth a try.

This game was one of the best games I've ever played. I went to all the questionmarks and completed/explored them in the Greece world and the DLC's, I had so much fun with it. It's an amazing and big world, there is just so much to explore. I really enjoyed my gameplay with Kassandra, I just loved her voice acting. Also, armor looks appropriate on her and makes her look badass, overall she is funnier than Alexios in my opinion. The main story was also pretty great. Some side quests were a bit boring because sometimes you needed to do things you already did like 10 times, but it's not that big of a problem because I explored new areas while doing the quests, so I still had some fun.

Overall I think it's a really good game and definitely worth your time.

I'll get the elephant out of the room...the performance is just awful. Very dissapointing, the engine is really starting to show it's age not to mention the multiple layers of DRM. I really hope this is addressed in the very near future, as it's quite a damp on an otherwise good game.

Moving on-This iteration of Assassin's Creed brings many new gameplay features like conquering areas and their leaders (kinda feels like something out of the middle earth series) as well as an all new dialogue/choice system that has real consequences that will last for the remainder of the game. One of my favourite parts of the new game is the awesome sailing and naval combat, you can upgrade ship and crew in many ways. I don't really like the "romance" system as it's always just some black screen :/

There's lots of RPG skill trees and more to upgrade your character, lot's of different armours and weapons allow deep customisation. Plus you have the choice of male or female character to play.

Despite the performance issues and a couple of bugs I've come across this is a solid open world game that I'm really enjoying, and with all the post launch content planned I may be playing this one for a while to come.

This game is HUGE. Thankfully it's also fun to play, unless you highly dislike the Ubisoft formula or RPG stats.
Kassandra is the best protagonist in the series so far, the actress did an amazing job at making her likeable and fun.

The various islands and regions are pretty varied, there's a lot of side-content to do, lots of variety in the build / style you can play and the modern timeline is pretty much non-existent (even less so than Origins).
I'm personally among the minority(?) that liked the modern bits of the series, but I pretty much lost any confidence that Ubisoft will ever commit to that part of the storyline, so better for it to be almost forgotten at this point.

My least favorite part of the game is the naval combat, mostly because it was done better in Black Flag. Here it's like a simpler, more boring version of what we had then.

Anyway, after the latest patches, the game has improved a lot; once you reach the max level of 99, you can truly become an Assassin Goddess: +crit chance bonus can now reach 100% while at full health!

I Really enjoyed this game!! Story line is very cool and funny, it kinda pushes you to keep playing the game :P
The DLCs were both really entertaining for me, enjoyed especially the Atlantis DLC and can't wait for episode 2!
Took me 130hrs to complete all achievements & quests, but still missing some locations on south.
The parkour could be a bit better, sometimes can't climb things I would climb in real life xD
The nature, buildings.. everything has awesome graphics!!

9.9/10! Loved the game!

Beautiful, lively and diverse world is compensating everything else about this game, such as quite dull gameplay with forts, 99% linear dialogs and plain characters (except maybe Sokrates).
Nowhere else you can walk the streets of Athens, Corinth and Sparta, and enjoy the view. Recommend as a decent game and gorgeous Ancient Greece virtual tour.

To start this is beyond a doubt one of the best games I've ever played. It easily goes into my top five game of all time.

Playing as Alexios (you can also choose Kassandra), right from the start I was sucked into the tragic and heart-wrenching story and blown away by the gorgeous and historically accurate environments.

I'm only 70 + hours in and have a lot of exploring and story left but i know this is one of those games I wish would never end.

Quick summary:

+ Gorgeous environments, one of the best worlds I've seen.
+ Well written and engrossing stories.
+ One of the better combat systems I've experienced.
+ Has numerous skills to level up, which can suit your play-style.
+ Offers a breathtaking journey through the ancient Mediterranean.

+++ You can spartan kick enemies..

I can say for sure this is an outright fantastic piece of work from Ubisoft and weather your a fan of the series or not, you should give this game a go.

Pros:
- Beautiful visuals, landscapes and world
- Great sound design, as expected from past AC games. Running on tiled rooftops feels so nice
- Fun combat
- Lots of mythology characters
-Packed with content, including a cool discovery mode, New Game+ and more nice features
- Solid PC version, with lots of options to play with
- Very long, even the main story alone with side quests done mostly in the beginning took me ~50 hours
Cons:
- The characters aren't interesting and sorta feel robotic
- Boring story
- Very grindy and tons of viewpoints to unlock (but also responsible for the plethora of things to do), also many very uninspired side missions
- Scaling enemies defeat the purpose of doing side missions
-Weird decisions when it comes to the story. For instance, one decision in the beginning of the game greatly defines the outcome of a late-game part

Awesome game, buy it FAST!
But needs some optimizations. If you target 30fps on very high or 50fps on med you are fine: (fx8350 + 1060 6gb + 16gb ram) You just can't get the always 60fps out of it.

Microtransactions have no place in a full priced title, especially when designing the game in a way that encourages purchasing them in order to get a proper experience.

Maybe they had to do it to recuperate adding the intrusive mess that Denuvo is :(

Gonna refund this now... Maybe the big companies will one day remember that it is in their very own best interest to please their audience, instead of scamming it in ever more imaginitive ways.

I have only just played the game and it is also my first Assassins Creed. Yeah, I know...I've been wondering myself how that can be.
I also have AC black flag on the account, but I thought I'd start with the game that many say is the best of the series.

The first few hours I understand this opinion: the game world is huge and detailed, the graphics charm you, the ship voyages are fun, there are horses (any game in which you can ride horses is basically good) and the characters are acceptable, but...

...yes, exactly, BUT: After a few hours, the facade crumbles. Maybe you are spoiled by The Witcher and other games, but at some point this great playground turns into a boring sandbox. I find myself skipping dialogs, getting upset why I have to run from A to B for nothing to bring someone something that I don't even know what anymore, because it doesn't interest me either.
The controls for climbing are sometimes a bit choppy, especially when climbing down and in caves.

The enemies level up with you. This has advantages but also disadvantages. If an enemy is too hard for me, I can't put it off until later like in other games, because it doesn't get easier later (unless you have skills that make it easier later).

Don't get me wrong: The game is, as I said, great and has its moments, but it doesn't sweep you off your feet story-wise and you get lost in all the strands. The "aha" moment is gone. And it's not like Ubi doesn't manage to surprise anymore. Far Cry 6 was good again after all the disasters that came after the third part.

However, this game is a nice way to pass the time in the evening while watching a stream or listening to a podcast to work through all the points on the map.

Note: Real gameplay time is approximately 25+ hours higher due to playing the game directly through Uplay before I picked it up on Steam.

---

I did not realize Assassin's Creed games could be this good. As a previous long-term fan that spent a lot of hours in the first few installments of the series, wasting time running around gathering the most minute flags and things and stuff with no real purpose, I had completely discarded this series the last couple of years due to "more of the same".

Odyssey ended up being a welcome surprise.

Long-term fans of the recent releases (especially those having played AC:Origins) will not find anything surprising about this latest installment of the series as in a way it is still much the same. But for those whom have been away for a while and are looking at a really good open world game with a ton of stuff to do and explore with the sort of lore/sci-fi elements that the Assassin's Creed series is known for, Odyssey will most likely be a fun game to pick up and play.

I am far away from completing the main storyline of the game, yet even knowing that doesn't faze me. This game excels when you simply partake in the everyday fun of an open world set in ancient Greece. It is a game about /your/ epic journey and adventure, and how it plays out and what events and mini-adventures you experience along the way is entirely up to you -- nobody else.

É um ótimo jogo mas não chega nem perto do carisma do protagonista de Origins. A mitologia Grega é maravilhosa e está lá, mas poderia ter sido melhor explorada nos quests principais.
______________
It's a great game but not even close to Origins when it comes to charisma of the MC. Greek mithology is amazing and it's there, but could have been better explored on the main quests.

This is a great action role-playing/open world game. Story has been pretty good and a ton of side mission content.

I'd liken it to Skyrim with a mythological twist.


Note - If you're playing this on Steam, it will need to launch UPlay in the background. Depending on your system setup, you may need to run Steam as Admin (right click Steam > Run as Administrator). The game would not launch unless I did this because the connection to UPlay couldn't establish properly.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a behemoth of a game. The world is absolutely huge, which, truth be told, after about half of it, wasn't really that great anymore. Several hundred points of interest, dozens upon dozens upon dozens of military forts, and probably a thousand or more chests later I can say I am really glad it's over. Collectocalypse aside, Odyssey is probably one of the best entries of the entire series, even although it's a far cry from AC2, which to this day remains to be the best AC game and probably will remain so in my personal ranking for quite some time.

While all the collectibles and points of interest are entirely overkill, the quests are not. Quest design, for the most part is very simple, but I personally enjoyed all those stories a lot and the support cast of characters was actually quite interesting.
While I liked the setting of Origins a lot more, Odyssey built upon the strengths of Origins and tweaked them further, steering the series more into a direction of a proper roleplaying game. For the first time in the series, actual choices were implemented. They don't change the entire story, but they do change some noticeable things in the game and this definitely was a step in the right direction. The only gripe I had with this was the fact that enemies keep leveling with you so that you constantly have to upgrade your gear or become unable to assassinate enemies due to lack of damage. That's a design choice which sucks, plain and simple. Does it take away from the fun? No, not really, even although it really is stupid.

All that being said, while I definitely do recommend Odyssey, I am quite miffed about the fact that AC Valhalla apparently is not going to get a steam release, ever. Major douchebaggery move by Ubisoft.

Only possible redeeming quality of this game is world building and graphics (if you're even able to have the game run properly,) and combat, which can be broken through bugging AI through rough terrain getting free hits and exploiting poor combat design like using assassins knock out on high level enemies like mercenaries.

Gear and level progression is noticably bad, stagnating leveling and gear progression, making the grind not fun but tedious. Ubisoft makes this an incentive and enticing to sell xp and resources boosters(microtransactions), in a singe player game. I feel robbed, but i learned my lesson.

At worse, purchase during steep discount.

After completing the main storyline and having decent hours on the game, I will say that I truly enjoyed the game. This game is soo much better than Origins, and more vibrant. It's a masterpiece in my opinion. The game starts off slow, but trust me, it picks up after a certain point. The graphics and the world looks amazing!! I just get lost sometimes in the game trying to get good screenshots with the photo mode (which is a great feature btw).

The story of the game is very good (I haven't finished the game completely yet, but I plan on doing it). The combat is very engaging, and the ship combat is very good too. As far as levelling up is concenred, I had no issues with it because there is just soo many things to do to level up easily, and getting good gear is not a hard thing either. So, final verdict, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who love RPGs. This game will definitely give you a huge amount of playtime. Can't wait for the DLCs.

Would you try to flip a profit at your kids birthday party by charging admission, food/dessert, and clean up fees?

Ubisoft would.

And they're going to wonder why no one shows up to the next party.

Seriously, 30 hours in and I can't play anymore because of the pop ups for DLC everytime I hit start or enter the map. I guess shelf this until Q2? Not sure what I'm supposed to do here guys.... Maybe you should have included the origin of the hidden blade in the game titled 'Origins' and not as a 2 part DLC for the Spartan storyline?

I don't even pay attention to the present day stuff because who was it even written for??? They killed off the protagonist to this series like 6 freaking games ago and have given 0 effort into engaging people with a new one. Yeah Desmond Miles sucked but at least his story was something to speculate about. Where's the WW2 stuff at? Where's the supernatural? WHERE IS THE ACTUAL ORIGIN STORY? Did the twins from syndicate go full incest and that's why we're able to play as both of them? Why would we get a remaster of 3 and rogue before black flag?

I'll recommend this game after they fix the pop ups. It's actually really fun as its own entity and doesn't rely on any of the other installments in the franchise.

It is my genuine view that AC Odyssey, despite its varying differences from prior Assassin's Creed games, is the best Assassin's Creed since the Ezio Trilogy. Graphically intensive, with great attention to detail, I find the freedom the game offers to be liberating. While it is not the same as previous Assassin's Creed games, having far more in common with an RPG than prior titles, I have found the gameplay loop satisfying. Exploration feels worthwhile, which ties into the sheer scale of the world, to my knowledge one of the largest open world maps made to date, and full of historical locations, tombs to raid, forts to attack and missions to complete. I have not yet found myself bored, which I typically would be by this point in time in most open world games.

The game's attention to detail is excellent. Greek statues show the paint that they were likely bathed in in real life. Walking through a field of wheat, your character will extend their hand and brush it through. Armour and weapons are accurate to the period, consisting of a variety of spears, axes, xiphon, kopis and more of that sort. What particularly impressed me was when I looted a Mycenaean tomb and discovered an "ancient sword" that was, blow for blow (so to speak), a virtual representation of Mycenaean era weapons excavated in real life. It's very well researched and is probably the most authentic portrayal of Greek society of the time made thus far (despite inevitable liberties and idealizations brought through via gameplay and the story itself). Given how ancient the subject matter is, and how little surviving material it is, it would be a foolish conceit to say that they game is totally accurate, but it portrays the Greek world as a living, breathing place, with reference to what we do know about it and with evident passion. Quite impressive.

Story is decent, delivering some good performances and some genuinely emotional moments. It provides a reasonable framework, good world building (which is necessary even in historical games), and some decently memorable characters. The Mykonos arc sticks out to me in particular, for a variety of reasons. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I would say that story is adequate, or even good, with brief flashes of excellence.

With this praise in mind, I find the game's optimisation to be inadequate, with continual stuttering. My computer is a decently powerful machine, featuring and RTX 2060 and Ryzen 7 2700x, parts far in excess of the recommended specs. Nevertheless, frames are not steady, and at times will even fall to twenty FPS. I'm not sure what causes it, but it points towards structural problems in the software, moreso than inadequacy of hardware.
Certain enemies have a tendency to be spongy, in the same way as other Ubisoft style games, which offsets the very real improvements made to AC's combat system. While dodging and attacking enemies feels satisfyingly kinetic, having to rely on a healthbar, as opposed, to say, enemy behaviour to gauge health breaks immersion rapidly. Especially when one has to hit a single enemy some twenty to thirty times, although this becomes increasingly rare as the game progresses. Outside of these issues, I have seen no real bugs or technical problems with this game, which has proven to be mostly stable, and generally a joy to play.

This game is a triumph for Ubisoft, and has taken its place as my most highly regarded game of 2018,

In essence it's an assassins creed game. Pretty much feels, looks and even tastes like an assassins creed game. But, it does try to mix it up, with having Witcher style game mechanics where the decisions “matter”, which can either be a hit or miss. Sure, microtransactions are bad, but i think the problems are far more deeper when in the first place the game feels like a chore.

TLDR(because my review on update became almost twice as long):
- Moving around is terribad, World too big
- Requires plenty of time to get anything done, game doesn't respect your time spent
- Repeated Animations is terrible and feels like the game is purposefully wasting your time
- Unskippable animations is the worst
- Even animations meant as a grand reward is repeated.
- Climbing is now easy.
- Cult system is made worst with terrible traversal
- Fast Travel points are random.
- Terrible picture mode that stops you from doing things you need to do.
- Same rinse and repetitive quests
- microtransactions (Obligatory complaint, but really doesn't bother me as much)

Ok you want more? Let’s break it down…

Traversal is a drag. You have a ship and a horse. You have fast travel points which are basically landmarks, but it takes a long time to get anywhere from point A to point B. I think it boils down to, traversal is just not fun. In Witcher, they had a lot of sign posts which made it less of a chore to return to previous areas again. In Just Cause 2 traversal was fun because of the hook + parachute combo, planes, helicopters or fast cars. But in this game it's just a complete chore. I get it that horses and boats was how people travelled at that time, but havens forbid we have to suffer the same fate.

Maybe the developers want us to take the same amount of time travelling around like people in that age, maybe grow a beard or two. And if you think sure you have a boat, you can only call upon your boat when you are near a port which is miles away from where you happen to stand, which i think is a terrible mechanic.

So you might think, why not go to each area and unlock the save points first? Well, sure, that’s a great idea, but the problem is they are placed relatively RANDOMLY. Some are actually close to one another, and others are so far apart it might actually take you IRL half and hour to get from one point to the other on your horse. And what makes it worst is that the game FORCES you to watch, WATCH your time wasted away by watching the camera do the same thing, follow your eagle as it flies around your head to WOW you with the wonderful scenery around. It’s cool for the first time but 10 times in, I was prepared to throw my keyboard at my monitor. And some genius thought to make it completely UNSKIPPABLE.

Now if the horse could actually fly, then it might make things different. Luckily there are umm... trainers that can help speed up gameplay without giving Ubisoft more money, and make travelling more bearable.

Combat is similar to the previous iteration, but climbing has now taken a back seat. Ubisoft never really figured on what they want the climbing mechanic to be throughout their sequels. More skill or just push up. Seems in odyssey they decided to go with the later. Climbing is automatic and you just have to push the up button. What’s even worst now is that points you can interact with has now became more of a texture than hand holds. Maybe it will look better on some PCs but it now looks like climbing is just vertical walking.

There is the cult system in which you have to dismantle the cult of cosmos, which is a templar stand in, which requires the player to do batman style investigations, run to a point then told to do another thing to uncover the big bad wolf of the area. Most of the time, you might be lucky to find one while on your travels, but it becomes a chore to go back and search for ones you miss (Refer to my criticism about traversal.).

Then there is the mercenaries system, which is a combo of the GTA Police + Shadow of mordor's lieutenant system. Its an interesting take but doesn't really add much to the game beyond being an annoyance. (You can actually pay off mercenaries in combat). The mercenaries have cool names, but lack personality as it behaves like any other grunt you will stab in the game.

Then there is the much touted PICTURE MODE. To me I’m not the sort of player to take screenshots in game, and I’m pretty sure most players don’t really do that, cos it seems more like chest beating “HEY LOOK AT MY AMAZING LOOKING GAME”, but for ♥♥♥♥ SAKE have a way to turn off that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feature. Not only does it populate your in game map with icons of random stranger’s photos, it would obstruct you from being able to click on where you actually want to go, like I dunno, A MISSION OBJECTIVE? Sure you can toggle it off, ONLY IN THE MAP. And the next time you load the game, bam it’s back to SHOW EVERYONE’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PHOTOS.

Also, the lack of rewards is quite noticeable. So, all your special magical abilities comes from a spear that takes the place of the assassin’s creed trademark hidden blade, but the problem is to upgrade it to unlock the next tier of skills, you have to hunt more of the cultists. Now that’s great and all, but each tier you unlock doesn’t reward you much. You watch the same cutscene, and you see the same blade glow the same. There is ABSOLUTELY no visual difference each time you make an upgrade.

Sure it maybe a great game according to meta critic and game reviewers out there, but FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKE, ARE THEY ACTUALLY OK WITH THIS?

Ahem.*straightens up and adjusts Tie…* All in all it's very much an assassins creed game and plays like an assassins creed game. It’s definitely a different game, I don't think there is enough of a breath of fresh air, sure it's an iteration on the Ubisoft formula, but unless you are a fan of assassins creed, those little problems add up, I’ll suggest you give it a miss. Now where’s my trainer…..

Game itself is great. Ubi's lack of offline mode is not.

Start steam in offline mode, start uplay in offline mode, try to play a single player game and get "cannot connect to internet, check connection and restart" message? Yeah, ♥♥♥♥ right off. Sorry, will never recommend single player games that do not need internet that require a connection because of.. what? In game store? Pff.

[Changed from previously negative review]

Thanks Ubisoft, now that AVX requirement is disabled I can finally play this game without any problems whatsoever. And it's definitely one of the best if not the best AC game I've played, even though it goes in a completely different direction.

It takes the well known BioWare-approach towards RPGs and steps into the now empty footprints of the failing BioWare studio, making this my favorite game since Skyrim.

Well done Ubisoft and thanks for changing the requirements in a couple of days!

118 hours in and I cannot stop playing. I am a female gamer and really thought I would play as Kass. She is fantastic but I love playing as Alexios. He won me over within the first 15 minutes of playing the game. Alexios has made me laugh many times. He has also made me tear up during certain major moments in the game. Both voice actors have really brought the protagonist to life. I just really enjoy how human and emotional Alexios is.

The world itself is so full of life. There are at times, almost too much to do., in a good way. The game has never been a grind. I have only completed one of the main quest lines and have so many islands I have not visited yet. I cannot express how great this game is.

After taking a break with a lot of the Assassin's Creed games around Black Flag I was initially really hesitant to try out Assassin's Creed® Odyssey but given how long it had been, I gave it a go, and I did not regret it!

Coming from the Ezio trilogy, Odyssey is a complete 180 on the series and how Ubisoft now approaches these titles. With a bigger focus on customization (weapons, armor, skills, gender, etc.) and taking open-world gameplay to a whole new scale, I EASILY dropped 180+ hours into this game just playing through all the quests and DLC. I thoroughly enjoyed the naval warfare and the improvements from Black Flag, loved the mercenary system and how frustrating it could be when they showed up mid-quest, and I really thought the conquest system with taking over regions was a highlight for the game and hopefully something we see in the future of the series.

Now comparatively to older AC titles, I am not sure I love the new (to me) gearing system with the abundance of useless gear I would get but I guess when you factor this into the customization with the skill tree, you really need this much gear to allow the flexibility for how you want to approach combat. Similarly to other AC games, there is an abundance of useless side quests that really make the game boring so I ultimately skipped these unless I needed the experience.

I am not 100% sure if I am a sucker for Greek mythology or just really enjoy the AC series but I loved Odyssey and now I plan to play through future entries into the series.

An almost-perfect representation of an ancient world with good attention to detail. Good gameplay with exceptional combat mechanics. The game severely fails in story, storytelling, and characters.
However, I don't get why people cry about the fact that this game has little similarity with the previous Assassin´s Creed titles. They did something different and interesting in terms of gameplay which does not force you to roleplay a sneaky "hidden blade guy".
Detailed review below:



Gameplay 9/10: An almost perfect movement/combat system with few limitations that annoyed me. (For instance, not being able to jump, even Zelda solved this). I really liked the amount of freedom the game gives you in terms of playstyle (Sneaky, Warrior, Hunter)

Story (Spoilers) 1/10: I have huge issues with the story in this game. The whole main story feels very rushed and forced. I really hated the idea of trying to make the main character special in some kind by giving him/her "sacred bloodline" that makes him/her special. I mean why are we related to both Pythagoras and King Leonidas. The game tries so hard to sell the story by forcefully adding "commercially known" names which really annoys me. And the storytelling is just awful, which left me confused and cringing many times.

Characters (Spoilers) 4/10: The characters in this game are really forgettable. They lack an interesting personality, they all just seem soulless like Minecraft villagers. And both of the main characters are just annoying as hell. Also, they tried so hard to make us hate Deimos which tries to make us connect to the story by feeling at least one emotion towards a character (Hate). But fails.

I am not even going to start how much I hated the animus (present-day) sequences. Like what were they even thinking when they were writing the script??

Great story-line. Wonderful characters. Great side quests. Just all around fun game if you aren't a completionist, lol. Then it's probably a nightmare.

If you are scared to buy AC Odyssey just because you had a bad experience with Origins, no need to be afraid of. Although there are some minor performance issues, at least for me, the game perfectly works compared to the previous game. Map is huge and scenery is beautiful, combat is almost the same with Origins, side quests are mostly lame and waste of time so do not chase down every quest you see like I did. Story itself is not great either and way too predictable but if you want my opinion, play as Kassandra and you'll see she will double the fun you'll have in the game. 7/10.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a weird one... On one side i enjoy the game's story, characters, combat, music but on the other i can't deal with the absurd grind this game has. As a college student i don't really have time to put in hundreads of hours toward games anymore and when the game become absolutely grindy (around level 16) that is simply a deal breaker for me. The fact that Ubisoft made this game a GRIND TO LEVEL UP to sell additional MICROTRANSACTIONS is also absurd! I already bought the game for $60 and don't want to spend additional money to be able to complete the game without spending countless amount of hours on grinding side quest and killing things for experience.. Also!! Side quests are generic at best.. Go to Point A, Kill B return to C to get a slap on the bum and XP, they also don't provide you with good enough rewards! It pains me to say it but i won't recommend the game to anyone, if the developer and publisher put this big of an emphasis on "You either grind or pay us more" Witcher 3 Wild Hunt made leveling, questing fun and enjoyable while Assassin's Greed: Odyssey of Microtransactions makes it generic, grindy and boring.

EDIT: The DLC/Season pass is worth the asking price, New Game+ is grind free for most part, The In-Game store is still dumb, skins and armor go for $5-15$ each without a good way of getting them for free in game. After going back to the game and seeing all the support devs give i have to switch my rating to recommended, it isn't often we see this level of post launch support for a game ( Looking at you EA)

When reviewing games I've purchased on Steam, I generally focus on all the mechanics of the game that make it horrible so that others don't waste their money. This is the first positive review I've ever felt compelled to write.

AC Odyssey is a TRUE open-world game in the arena of Fallout/Elder Scrolls/SoW. And the world is absolutely HUGE, even when using fast travel points and/or your horse. You can easily find yourself spending HOURS just running around exploring. Although Steam states I have 193 hours logged in the game, I only have 93 hours of game time (ONLY RIGHT! LOL!), and I'm not even CLOSE to completing it.

The world is BEAUTIFUL! The developers really did an awesome job building it and making it look just wonderful. In fact, after playing several hours for a few days, I decided to upgrade my graphics card (now: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 OC 6G Graphics Card, 2X Windforce Fans, 6GB) simply because of this game. I wanted to see how good it looked with higher resolution textures, and I was NOT disappointed; however, you need a really good CPU/GPU to play it at its highest resolution. Even with the upgraded GPU I had to set some settings lower than maximum, which really made me contemplate building a brand new rig altogether.

If you like history, this is a great game to play. You'll learn all kinds of interesting tidbits, especially if you do some research outside of the game while you're not actively playing it.

As far as questing goes, it is pretty much a go there kill/find/steal and return for your reward, but all of the quests have full cut scenes and voice acting. And there are a TON of quests. That being said, some real time went into developing most of the quests and some of them are flat out hilarious (the blacksmith! LOL!), especially if your character is the promiscuous sort, which, of course, mine was! (I can't believe that slut was censored by Steam!)

Combat. It's a hack and slash system with assigned skill sets. Sadly, you spend a whole lot of time pressing the space bar (dodge) while playing on Nightmare difficulty. You can eventually hot key 12 abilities. 8 melee, 4 ranged. Respecting is simple if you want to try various combinations. There's also naval combat. This is the first game I've played with naval combat, so I don't have a comparison, but it's straightforward, and you end up using a MASSIVE amount of resources to upgrade your ship's combat abilities.

There isn't a level cap. Once you hit level 50, a secondary system activates that you can spend your level up points on, if you don't want to spend them on primary abilities. The secondary system lets you spend up to 20/20 in each subsection (for example: Increasing Critical Hit %) and there are dozens of secondary statistics to increase.

Replayability. You can choose to play the male or female character at the beginning of the game. I've yet to finish a play though, but as I've played, I've realized that it's possible that many of the quests would've ended up differently had I chose a different dialogue option. I'm not the type of player to replay every quest to select different choices just to see what would've happened, but on a few I did, and the tone of the encounter changed drastically. Therefore, I began playing my character as a good kindhearted murderer (that steals everything in sight) with the intention of playing the opposite gender (thankfully only two options) as the evil hard-booty (Thanks filter!) murderer (that will steal everything in sight). Yes, you pretty much murder your way through the entire game (and steal lots of things) =P

I skipped around playing AC games. I played 1, 2, and 3 and purchased several others that I didn't have time to get around to playing, yet, but the open world component of Odyssey drew me in, and it was worth it.

Overall, this is easily the best game I've played, and one of the main reasons is because I have yet to encounter a bug! While games like Fallout/Elder Scrolls REQUIRES the community to fix the multitude of bugs released in their games, AC, to date, is flawless.

I've spent the same amount of money on various games through Steam over the years (74 in my library) that haven't even come close, and I mean CLOSE, to a FRACTION of how good AC Odyssey is. For me, someone who plays single player games exclusively, this game sets the bar. If other developers can't make stunning single player games this good, without massive amounts of bugs, they'll find themselves with a lot less customers.

TL;DR - BUY IT, PLAY IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT.

Amazing realistic scenery, more quests than you can count, at least two major quest lines with intriguing twists and challenges. I have been playing more than 400 hours and still have plenty of interesting quests and challenges.

Dear Ubisoft, for sneakily reducing rewards to MMO like levels with later patches (after all the reviews were in) in order to boost sales of your for-real-money helix booster packs, you can go shove that monetization where the sun does not shine.

!!! BUYER BE WARNED !!!!

Game is incompatible with the newest AMD graphics card Radeon 5700 XT and simply can't be played.

Both AMD and Ubisoft have been aware of issue for 2+ months and currently neither have addressed the issue. It is affecting all users of Radeon 5700 XT cards.

Will not change rating unless fixed.

UPDATE: 11/08/2019 - Ubisoft has stated they will not be fixing this game breaking flaw for the Radeon 5700 XT and has also stated they will not be issuing or allowing any kind of refunds. To Ubisoft and all your employee's and partners. F*** yourselves.

Lol i played for 9h and i got the screen "Ubisoft presents... Assassin's Creed ODYSSEY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥". So i just played the tutorial for 9h. I just arrived in a big city and omfg there seems to be so much to do! Exploration feels great, combat system is good, stealth is satisfying, crafting is a bit crap but that's not the focus on this game.

I'd definitely recommend it to someone looking for an immersive a-rpg with optional stealth takedowns, freeroam exploration with great platform movements, bounty hunting, beat'em all, a bit of sea pirating, etcetcetc.

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is a diamond in the rough to say the least of the matter. From the perspective of a gamer and a long-time fan of the Assassin’s Creed series it is yet another entry to the franchise with a few minor tweaks compared to the previous years offering. As a historian it represents a rare and beautiful opportunity to explore an authentic recreation of the ancient Greek world. These two overarching ideas define the ACO experience and often clash with each other.

Touching more on the lackluster gameplay ACO treads little new ground here, the combat system while updated is still very much reliant on counter playing you opponents attacks and dodging the incredibly obvious and infrequent heavy attacks. ACO features a leveling system that always ensure enemies are damage sponges and incentivizes players to pursue gear with higher number values than their current equipment. This creates an environment where the player never feels powerful, this is accentuated further by the lack of actual assassinations. One would presume in a game titled Assassin’s Creed there would be some assassinating, you would be wrong. ACO proudly features a choose your own gameplay style mechanic that effectively removes all assassinations from the game. This serves as a true disconnect from the Assassins Creed of days gone by; no longer are players be able to roam the streets of an interesting and unique town planning how to take on the guards defending the next objective. Instead the player is faced with set piece battles where Sparta and Athens resolve their differences by throwing away countless lives at hilt of your sword.

This shift in the core concept of what Assassins Creed is supposed to be has been some time in the making, I would say ever since the end of Ezio’s storyline in Assassins Creed Revelations. What has transpired is that the series has moved away from being a good stealth game with a fantastic, engaging and vibrant open world; and instead become a mediocre fighting game with famous people and places plastered on top. This shift appears to be almost a successful as an attempt to drill a hole in a wood plank with a grenade.

The history in Assassins Creed fares much better, exploring the world reveals a great many interesting historical locations that will be fun to explore… the first time. The issue become readily apparent within the first three or four hours of gameplay. In their haste to release ACO on the annual timetable the developers recycled assets, even entire buildings and their interiors may be found dozens, if not hundreds of times. It is almost as if the ancient Greeks mastered the art of 3D fabricating an entire city block and used this knowledge to copy paste entire towns. This obviously rushed design for the world loses its appeal fast with some notable exceptions, Athens and Sparta. Both cities suffer from this issue to a much lesser degree and are simply massive. This provides players with an awesome historical environment to explore and I spent several hours running around Athens remarking on how authentically it was recreated.

Taken in its current state, a few months after release, Assassins Creed Odyssey is far from perfect and has many glaring flaws. Despite this the developers are obviously passionate about their work and the game’s historic setting is not neglected. This being stated it is impossible to ignore the flaws of the game and as such I will not be recommend purchasing this game at any price above 20$, perhaps even waiting for the obligatory DLC packages to be released may be a wise idea. If you cannot stand grindy combat systems avoid this game at all costs and it has taken the top prize for grind away from Elite Dangerous and set itself as the king of the grind.



Comment response from the author:

Perhaps I did a poor job of phrasing some of the criticism in the review above, as such I shall elaborate here. Whilst it is technically possible to assassinate enemies in ACO, there are no set piece assassinations as seen in previous titles. For example, in Assassins Creed 2 there was substantial build up to numerous assassinations such as with Bernardo Baroncelli and Uberto Alberti. Both of these rather minor characters had an arc where it is shown why Ezio wanted them dead, the process of preparing for the assassination and then the actual assassination itself with well scripted and voiced dialogue. One of the most memorable moments from the original Assassins Creed was where a templar was burning books saying that they could be used to spread false knowledge and that such a danger could not be tolerated; Altair killed him and it was later learned via interaction with the world that the books contained a ton of false knowledge that should have been destroyed, thus leading the player to view their previous actions as hasty. Such memorable missions and stories do not exist in ACO, the assassinations are simply not there. A player in ACO can atop a roof and wait for a passing guard (note not a leader or mercenary unless they are specifically vulnerable to assassinations as their health pool is far too high) and the assassinate them; this is not the same experience.

Furthermore I have been accused of not understanding what kind a game ACO is attempting to be, this is simply not true. It is my assessment that the character stats customization is done poorly; not that it shouldn’t exist. At many points the game railroads the player into open combat, which forces players to interact with the inaccurate hitboxes and clunky combat system. This game’s combat system is not up to par with 2018 levels of gameplay for a melee combat system, this could be overlooked if it was realistic to avoid these systems however the player is forced to interact with them constantly.

I also feel I should add here since it is not clear in the review itself. I love Assassins Creed and I hope that Ubisoft can recover from the recent decline in quality with Assassins Creed titles. Black Flag was a great pirate game, however a poor Assassins Creed game. It appears that the primary issue facing the developers of Assassins Creed today is that they are expected to cram in so many gameplay elements that they cannot make them all fun and balanced, as such the end product is a jack of all trade but ace at none.

~OVERALL RATING~
83%

~ SUMMARY ~
Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an epic open world adventure. The games is visually spectacular, and although Greece is beautiful, nothing compares to the worlds of the expansion - they are some of the most beautiful environments I've ever seen in a game, even competing with Toussant in The Witcher 3. I feel like I know Greece incredibly well from all the quests that take you all across the ancient world.

The characters are quite 2 dimensional, except for the protagonist and antagonist, who are interesting and well developed. The worst part of the experience was the 2-3 hour period in the first expansion where you fall in love, get married, have a child and then have it all fall apart - it was all far too poorly scripted and devoid of any emotional investment. Interesting ideas poorly executed.

Still, it was a great experience, and even though the narrative was pretty weak it was a hell of an adventure.

Auf Deutsch:
Da ich das Spiel nun so gut wie durchgespielt habe (mit den beiden extra Inhalten), würde ich gerne eine Review verfassen um einigen vielleicht ebenfalls den kauf leichter zu machen.
Erst einmal muss ich erwähnen das ich Kassandras Story gespielt habe, muss aber dazusagen das die von ihrem Männlichen Gegenpart wohl nicht allzu anders sein soll.
Die einzelnen Geschichten und auch die Story an sich sind umfangreich (für die Hauptstory habe ich ca. 100 Stunden gebraucht) und auch die beiden DLCs bringen noch einmal um die 70 Stunden Spielspaß. Die Hauptcharakterin Kassandra hat mir sehr gut gefallen, sowohl vom Auftreten als auch von der Art. Die angenehme und schön anzusehende Grafik machen das Spiel detailreich und viele der Charaktere wachsen einem schnell ans Herz, sowohl von der Story her als auch vom Auftreten. Viele Nebenquests in der umfangreichen und großen Spielwelt, sorgen dafür das man relativ leicht Leveln kann und somit auch immer seinen Gegnern gewachsen ist.
Natürlich hat man auch die Möglichkeit durch einige der Quests an unterschiedliche Romanzen zu kommen, welche (und das kann man durchaus bemängeln) nicht sehr Tiefsinnig sind und zu der eigentlichen Story absolut nichts beitragen.
Die DLCs kann man sich kaufen und im Falle des Atlantis DLCs würde ich das auch durchaus empfehlen, aber man braucht sie nicht unbedingt, außer man möchte alle Errungenschaften haben. Legacy of the first Blade war auch ein gutes Extra, allerdings meiner Meinung nach Storytechnisch sehr überzogen und im Grunde auch nicht wichtig.
Bei keiner der Quests ingame gab es ein Problem und das Spiel ist bis auf ein paar kleineren Bugs so gut wie Bugfrei, außerdem habe ich nie das Gefühl gehabt nicht weiter zu kommen und man wird auch nicht einfach so in das Geschehen hineingeworfen, sondern arbeitet sich langsam hoch. Das Söldnerrangsystem hat mir ebenfalls gut gefallen, bei welchem man aufsteigen kann wenn man Gegner die über einem stehen Tötet. Was mich hier allerdings genervt hat, ist die Tatsache das Söldner einfach aufgetaucht sind wenn man in Schwierigkeiten war, soll heißen das man schon gegen Gegner gekämpft hat und dann plötzlich noch ein oder mehrer Söldner dazukommen, die einen Jagen. Man sollte selbst entscheiden können wann man wen töten möchte, was bei allen anderen Entscheidungen und Gegnern immer der Fall war.
Alles in allem ein super Spiel mit dem ich bereits mehrere Spielstunden zugebracht habe und auch noch einige mehr verbringen werde.
Wer ein Fan der Assassin's Creed Reihe ist sollte sich diesen Teil nicht entgehen lassen und auch für jeden nicht Fan wäre das eine Gelegenheit um einzusteigen. Kaufen sollte man sich das Spiel und die Erweiterungen eher im Sale, da man mehr als 60% sparen kann. Für mich eines der besten Spiele und deshalb eine klare Kaufempfehlung.

In English:
Now that I have almost played through the game (with the two extra content), I would like to write a review to maybe make the purchase easier for some.
First of all I have to mention that I played Kassandra's story, but I have to say that it shouldn't be that different from her male counterpart.
The individual stories and also the story itself are extensive (it took me about 100 hours for the main story) and the two DLCs bring around 70 hours of fun again. I liked the main character Kassandra very much, both in terms of appearance and style. The pleasant and beautiful graphics make the game rich in detail and many of the characters grow to your heart quickly, both in terms of story and appearance. Many side quests in the extensive and large game world ensure that it is relatively easy to level and is therefore always up to your opponents.
Of course, you also have the opportunity to get to different romances through some of the quests, which (and one can criticize that) are not very profound and contribute absolutely nothing to the actual story.
You can buy the DLCs and in the case of the Atlantis DLC I would definitely recommend it, but you don't really need them unless you want to have all the achievements. Legacy of the first blade was also a good extra, but in my opinion it was very overly technical and basically not important.
There was no problem with any of the in-game quests and the game is practically bug-free except for a few minor bugs, and I never had the feeling that I was getting stuck and you weren't just thrown into the action, but worked slowly up. I also liked the mercenary ranking system, where you can upgrade if you kill opponents who are above you.
What annoyed me here, however, is the fact that mercenaries just showed up when you were in trouble, which means that you had already fought against opponents and then suddenly one or more mercenaries came to hunt. You should be able to decide for yourself when you want to kill whom, which was always the case with all other decisions and opponents.
All in all a great game with which I have already spent several game hours and will also spend a few more.
Anyone who is a fan of the Assassin's Creed series should not miss this part and for anyone who is not a fan it would be an opportunity to get started. You should buy the game and the extensions rather in the sale, because you can save more than 60%. For me one of the best games and therefore a clear buy recommendation.

Game is beautiful to look at, boring and repetitive to play.

I almost always finish the main story in single player games but I couldn't bring myself to in Odyssey. I got to a point and the wind in my sails just stopped and I couldn't be bothered anymore. The quests are fun to begin with and a few major plot points early on kept me interested, but once you keep progressing you find yourself doing the same things again and again and by then the novelty has worn off. Most of the characters have forgetful personalities except for a couple perhaps.

Its a shame they built such as beautiful world and ended up putting very little in it, I saw a lot of cool looking and beautiful landmarks but had no reason to stop or explore them.

The game plays very well and the combat is very smooth. But the mercenary system which is something vaguely similar to Monolith's Nemesis system is so pointless and bland, and after awhile just starts to become a nuisance.

TL;DR
If you like beautiful open world games with repetitive and monotonous tasks to do with a 'meh' story, this is for you.

Buy it when there's a big sale if so, the scale of it warrants a AAA price tag but the experience doesn't.

For as much as I wanted to enjoy this game, it's just not for me. I wanted a story rich adventure filled with exploration and exciting combat, but Odyssey fell dramatically short. The main story line is level locked so that you have to grind out boring side missions before you can follow the main quest. At first this is exciting, but they quickly become repetitive and follow the same format. The level locking is horrible. You can't even fight enemies a single level above you.

At first, the world seems vast and exciting, but it quickly starts to reveal itself as being empty. Traversing it is more of a hassle than a fun journey. I really wanted to like this game, but unfortunately it's just not for me and I can't recommend it.

In a nutshell, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an extremely good game. Although currently, I've got only 56 hours of play time in this game, which some of you may think it's a lot or only a little, I can assure you that this game will not be a waste of time and money. Assassin's Creed Odyssey has nice graphics and enjoyable main and side quests but these aren't all that this great game has. To tell you the truth, I've always felt that from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to Assassin's Creed Syndicate, optional objectives tend to limit a player's way to complete a mission if he/she wants full synchronization in the mission. So, in Assassin's Creed Origins, I really like how they don't include the feature anymore and in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, the developers even include a choice feature, which, in my opinion, really strengthen the "I make my own story" feeling. This really make me enjoy more in-game freedom. Lastly, I'd like to say that I really recommend buying the game but don't complete the game too fast, though, you should take your time and enjoy every bit of gameplay (side quests, location objectives, etc) of this great game, Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

Odyssey’s moment to moment gameplay is incredibly fun. Exploring the world always leads to new and worthwhile experiences, finding a lost treasure in flooded temple ruins, surviving waves of enemies in the arena and taking down another champion, tracking a conspirator to their home and assassinating them in their sleep. But even after completing the main story, there’s still so much left to uncover that I’m nearly as overwhelmed with where to go and what to do next as I was when I started. The three main story pillars weave in and out of one another, but for a large chunk of the adventure you have access to quests from each, so there’s both a variety to choose from and meaningful things left to complete when you finish the main character’s family story. Whether I’m hunting down the remnants of the sinister Cult of Kosmos, fighting mythological monsters, or hunting the great beasts of Greek legend, there’s a staggering amount of content left to discover.

Then there’s the new Mercenary system, which is inspired by Origin’s Phylakes but, again, is bigger and better. Instead of just 10 ultra tough enemies wandering the world trying to skewer me, there are numerous mercenaries who wander about and, if I cause too much trouble, will try to collect the bounty on my head. These mercenaries remind me of Shadow of Mordor’s nemesis system, although without personalities that evolve with each encounter I have with them.

My favourite activity was to hunt down the members of the Cult of Kosmos, the conspirators who tore my family apart. . It's a lot of work hunting down these 44 cultists across Odyssey's big map, but it's a testament to how well Odyssey's systems work within each other, that this is one of the best parts of the game. Many cultists are unmasked as part of the main story, but the rest require scouring the world for clues to their identity. Sometimes I might have to complete an out of the way side quest, while others require reading stolen letters to deduce their location.

When I look back on all the fun I’ve had, the complaints I can only have are based on the nostalgic memories and experiences of a traditional AC franchise game. Assassin's Creed Odyssey is enormous and beautiful, and it effortlessly ties action, stealth, sailing, faction control systems, mercenaries, and cultist hunting together into one cohesive game that, even after 70 hours, I want to keep playing. Odyssey is a lot more than just another Assassin’s Creed, it’s an RPG of unparalleled scale supplemented by satisfyingly layered and deep progression systems that each play their part in bringing a beautifully sculpted ancient Greece to life.

So while Odyssey is easily the best Assassin’s Creed I have ever played, and a damn good RPG, there's still some fundamental parts that could've been improved (weaving the franchise theme of Assassins into the story).

I'm new to the Assassin's Creed series. However, I recently bought and played AC: Origins and enjoyed it despite the late-game grind, for the wonderfully detailed setting with remarkable verisimilitude, a relatable main character, and well-written quests that fleshed out the setting and the story. This set high expectations for Odyssey, which it regrettably failed to meet.

Where Origins did a remarkable job of crafting a believable Ptolemaic Egypt, Odyssey is lazy pulp. Here, mythological characters are real, the landscape is littered with twisted monumental statues, giant monstrous skeletons, and "precursor civilisation" ruins, Spartans have more in common with "300" than who they really were, and unpleasant characteristics of the Greek civilisations -- such as ubiquitous slavery and utterly oppressive patriarchy -- have been edited away. Instead of the warm and personable Bayek with his complex relationship to Aya we get tough-guy/gal Alexios/Kassandra, as clichéd action-heroes as things get. And the story gets weirder and weirder, dumber and dumber from the start.

The gameplay is somewhat improved from Origins -- where brawling was merely passable in the previous instalment, it's much more varied and satisfying in Odyssey. However, this gets old around the "you have killed 100 enemies with a spear" point, however you slice (or stab) it. Moreover, the MMO-style leveling completely neuters any sense of progression, as fighting on level 5 is much the same as fighting on level 50, since you'll be fighting enemies of the same level. Instead, it imposes continuous busywork, swapping and upgrading gear and grinding cookie-cutter quests (procedurally generated or otherwise) for XP.

I was expecting a step up from Origins. Instead, I got a small step forward in one limited area (brawling) and many steps back in the areas that made Origins fun. I could only take less than 20 hours of playing this before giving up: at the point where Origins was picking up speed, Odyssey already feels like a chore. Regrettably, I'm going to have to give Odyssey a thumbs-down. It's just lazy, grindy, repetitive, and frankly boring; the only thing it has going for it is an addictive core gameplay loop with frequent rewards, but then so does Tetris and that takes up a lot less disk space.

What can i say after 250 hours playing to reach the 100% game completion ?

- I can say the game is awesome, malaka ! The best of all AC series !


Highlights :
The story : two attractive characters and dialogues choices with consequences without forget the incredible story of the Spartans and Athenians at the Ancient Greece.
The map : My crush for sure, 1400 miles to the counter ! Check my screenshots to see the most beautiful explorations i did !
Cult of Kosmos : I loved to identify the Cult one by one, finding clues and track them down.
Conquest Battles : Only because i made a bloodshed everytime and it's relaxing.

Excellent setting, story and characters. Legendary Hellenes like Socrates, Alcibiades, Pericles, Aspasia along with characters created for the game come to life vividly, with the exact right amount of cheesiness to make them videogameworthy. Assassinations are still fun, with some added nuances that have made it better. Combat is solid, with plenty of weapon types and abilities. Life at sea and naval combat is as enjoyable as ever, but a little simplistic compared to Black Flag. Massive amount of content including new additions such as epic battles and randomly generated missions. Duelling mercenaries, heroes and other special characters is a joy. The gameworld seems to intelligently level up along with the player character. which means the player never really gets too overpoweredm. You can still find weak / underleveled enemies, but never more than two levels below you.

If you think you'd like the love-child of God of War and a crappy MMO, you'd probably like AC:Odyssey. If, however, you remember fondly your time with Ezio or Altair, you probably will find this game to be a flat, boring slog.

AC:Odyssey is essentially a clone of Origins. Same basic MMO-esque mechanics where your choices matter not a whit and you have to spend an unjustifiable amount of time and effort on getting crap to buy/upgrade your equipment. Unless, of course, you delve into the veritable Hell of Ubisoft's microtransactions.

Here's my biggest gripe, though: You can't assassinate anyone. Even having every "assassin" skill unlocked, with legendary equipment geared toward stealth assassinations, a successful stealth attack of the kind you used to employ to one-hit "bosses" in prior games only takes 1/4 or 1/3 of their health away, leaving you to furiously wail on them with bizarre weapons and an array of magical skills like a League of Legends-type game. This ain't Assassin's Creed anymore.

Played as Kassandra and first thing i noticed is the huge improvement in the writing compared to Origins, it makes you more attached to the character and look forward to any funny or awkward conversation that will happen at any time, that made me fall in love with Kassandra, something that didn't happen with the previous AC games and no, it's not because she's a girl! It helped a bit, alongside me trying to sleep with each women i encountered in this game turning Kassandra into one of the most famous lesbian in the ancient world!
Choices matter and you can solve the missions and end them in a different way depending on what you decide to do, that includes the ending, i wont give more details about that because i'm trying to avoid any spoilers.

It's not a classical Assassins vs Templar story, a fresh shift from what we saw over and over again, it didn't mind that, while at time, as usual with AC games, the main story is predictable but what adds an excellent touch to it is some very nice and funny side quests, the "Gold Explanation Point" quests and not the recycled side quests and contracts that you get from boards, those are just fillers, ultra short fetch quests that might help if you are short on XP.

As for the gameplay, this is the baby child of Origins and Black Flag and it took the good things from the parents, very fun combat and skills, if you complete the game 100% you'll be close to a demigod which makes the game a bit easy toward the end, you are too powerful and extremely well geared to massacre anyone no matter which approach you'll use. I was hoping for more challenging enemies and bosses, something that will make use of the different RPG elements they added to make it a deeper, for example some enemy that makes me do a special enhanced armor for it, the perks are nice and useful but you have a feeling that you don't need most of them, that is maybe done on purpose not to alienate casual Assassin's Creed fans.

World is huge & gorgeous, you can press photo mode at any moment and end up having an excellent screenshot, each frame is beautiful, they created a rich open world with amazing views. The map is so huge that the main story doesn't even take you to half of the regions/islands.

I had a lot of fun playing this game and i'm looking forward to play the additional content that Ubisoft will be adding to it, free missions and the ones from the season pass, they are taking the game in a good direction and i would love to see deeper fighting and better enemies in the next one.

This is my first connect with the Assessin's Creed universe - and I have to say, I liked the entry.
I mean, I kinda find the "overarchiung background story" a bit... I don't know... irrelevant (where you play this other character from an organisation.... no spoilers) but those scenes are prety rare and so short, that it does not not fully break the immersion the actual game creates.
The world is huge. I mean really huge. I ghave something like 190+h on the clock and still not seen every corner of the world And I spent already a good portion of my playtime doing side quests and just taking time to exoplore the Greek world from the game. Which was really nice and made so much fubn, I sometimes had to force me back on the Story Quest track to progress further.

Gameplay is realy intuitive and the possibility to create multiple "sets" with your equipment fueling different play styles (Assassin, Hunter and Warrioir) is excellent - no, I guess if you want the "best built" you will have to focus on one of these three aspects, but I went with the a little bit of everything (though my focus was Assassin, of course) and had my fair share of fun with this approach.

I am very much intrigued to get the Atlantis DLC as well, as I want to explore this path further.

Played 100% on Linux, no tinkering, using Manjaro, amdgpu, and Proton Experimental - not a single issue, alt+tab is working perfectly, like a native game.
If interested in particular thing, leave a comment, I'll answer any question

I dont typically write reviews, not unless a game is exceptionally good, or extremely bad. This review actually falls in the middle.

Story: I find the story enjoyable thus far, I was expecting something bare bones, but there is actual story here. The player is able to make choices that can alter a story in some way shape or form, some larger than others. I havent completed the game yet, however its probably the only reason I am playing. The only complaint is now that the game plays more like an RPG/Adventure game, story missions called be level gated, forcing you to do "skyrim level" quests. By that, the quests usually are little more than "go to this fort and find this item in a chest" or "Go over here and kill something". This just bogs down the game substancially. I am only level 33 and played almost 40 hours.

Combat: This is the games achillies heel (pun intended). You see, the games combat system relies on getting better equipment from varying weapons (spears, two handed bladed, swords, daggers ect) to armor sets. As you level up you gain ability points which can be fun to use. You can get abilities such: the ability add poison/fire to your weapon, charge forward, sparten kick (like 300), rip an opponents shield from them and throw it at their head like a destruco disk, heal for a percentage of health, or unleash a large flurry of blows that depend on weapon type (daggers will strike a single target several times while hammers allow you to target a single opponent while being able to chain to 2 others). This is well appreciated and I enjoy the fact that you can choose a weapon prefference, though most of the time the damage difference is negligable.

So you get into a fight with some Spartan soldiers, one guy is duel wielding maces, another has a spear and shield, the other guy has just the spear. Combat usually revolves around you being able to attack when available and watching your opponents attempt to strike you, in which you can do one of two things. If their weapon glints like a sun striking metal at the right angle, you can perform a parry, allowing you to stun everyone in a short radius and open up those enemies. If the enemy glows red while attacking, the attack is unblockable and you can dodge, if you dodge at the right time, you can go into slow motion which allows you to get in a few attack or just get some distance.

Here we get to the part that has driven me to make this review, because it was absolutely rage inducing. You see, besides the average grunts you can fight, there are harder enemies (akin to mini/bosses) called mercenaries. Now these mercenaries will follow you to Hades and back. You gain a sort of "wanted meter" as you go about the world doing bad things, such as killing civilians, guards, soldiers, stealing, ect. These mercenaries are just like grunts, but have a bit of the nemesis system built into it, meaning they may be able to bring a pet bear with them to fight along side them, but may be weak to assassination attacks. Other than that, they are honest to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sponges, think of a boss that is reletively easy single handed, that you can easily fight one on one, but for some reason the developers decided to give him enough health to last 100 attacks for no reason. The good news is that they can drop some sweet loot, but you have to kill them and whatever buddies they decide to take along.

Here is what drove me to make this review. As I said I am level 33 by the time this mission is around. I am tasked with killing a man in a fort, this man is a cultist and a side objective. This fort has around 30 guards roaming around. I dont want to start a fight immediately and instead attempt to assassinate my way to a brazzier (which the guards can use to call for reinforcements, which you dont want). I have a bounty on me as the game forces one on me for this mission. In my head I am thinking "there are no bounty hunters here, so as long as I am not seen no bounty hunters will show up" my train of though being they would only appear if there were rumors I was at this for. Makes logical sense right?

So I am killing EVERYONE in this fort silently and quickly. To make sure the bodies of the dead are not found, I carry their bodies and throw them off the edge of the tower to the forest below, where NOBODY will find them and summon bounty hunters here. I get about 80% through killing everyone when I see not one, not two, but THREE bounty hunters walk through the gate.

At this point, my plan to silently kill this cultist and complete my mission is screwed, because as soon as I would try to fight him, these guys would show up and screw me over. So I attempt to ambush them and kill them as quickly as I can (as quickly as you can kill a sack of health taking of as little as 3% of their health with an entire combo).

I do just that, I get a sneak attack on one of them and then realize the odds are stacked agains me. Not only am I facing 3 people at one time, but I notice they all have different weapons. One guy has duel daggers with poison applied (daggers are extremely quick and hard to tell when its save to parry), a girl has the same sets of daggers with poison, and another is duel wielding maces (reletively easy). Now if that wasnt bad enough, they are all at 2-3 levels higher than me, meaning they soak up even more damage and deal more damage.

I down the woman carrying poison daggers and the duel mace wielder, and focus on the last enemy and I am more than ready to get this fight over with. Then I see on my map not one, not two, not even three, but 6 more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bounty hunters with varying weapons, attributes, and levels. I am beyond pissed off.

The fight continues, I somehow down two more, but now im not really fighting, im just dodging praying to mighty zues I dont get hit by anything. So while im fighting anywhere from 2-4 bounty hunters in melee combat (some of which decided to bring animals like bears and wolves) while the remaining enemies are chucking fire/poison grenades, shooting fire/poison arrows, or otherwise being a pain in the ass. As im fighting those in melee I cant even attack anyone because im constantly attempting to parry light attacks, dodge heavy attack, dodge arrows, dodge bombs, avoid poison melee attacks, avoid basically anything and everything.

On top of that someone has called for reinforcements and I am probably fighting 15 enemies at one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time, half of these people I am doing so little damage to, its like I am doing more damage to my controller by repeatedly hammering either the light attack or dodge buttons, and even when I do connect its the equivelent of throwing a satin pillow at a concrete wall, halariously ineffective.

I end up dying, of course, taking out only about two more people. In total, assassinating everyone in the fort probably takes 10 minutes and the rest tas around 30-40 (I ♥♥♥♥ you not) and I had to do it, not once, not twice, but four ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ times because every time after I got in the fort, at least 3 bounty hunters show up, with even more backup on the way.

I eventually did beat it, but this huge fault in the game shows that the difficulty isnt in the enemies styles or weaponry or tactics, its sheer numbers. Games like dark souls usually have few enemies which are unique in their attacks, openings, or general strategies. Odyssey just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ throw everything in the kitchen sink, the fridge, and the master bedroom at you and expects you to just be ok with it. I for one am not a fan of wasting nearly 2 hours on a single MANDATORY mission, which is relatively easy but enjoyable, but arbitrarily made difficult by damage sponges.

Game is fun, but keep this type of stuff in mind, youll be seeing a whole lot of it.

After I saw the teaser of the game with "Sparta Kick" I immediately Pre-Ordered this game, but I recently finished it and there are very Less words to describe how beautiful and interesting this game really was.

Out of all Assassin's Creed games this one is my new Favorite. To all Assassin's Creed fans or not you must try this game, Simply the mere words are not enough to describe this game and when you play it you will also be speechless.

The battle of "300" and Spartan and Athens at each other's throats. Finally removed the confusion about the "Ones who came before", again not enough words to explain try it yourself.

10 out of 10 and Highly Recommended

AC Odyssey has a beautiful vibe, the most captivating game iv'e played, an almost endless stream of enjoyment (522 hours) but that tends to wear thin with repetitive quests and a lack of a good story towards the end, also no clear path through the cultists which leads you wondering whether you should hunt them down or if you will find them as a natural part of story progression later on, also the endless amount of question marks all over the map overwhelms me.
I'm on my second play through, though i did finish the story the first time i didn't kill all the cultists or even travel to every island. I guess its good to have lots of content but not when its the same old.
games fun as f#k no cap, but theres potential for something better, they need to reboot this b1tch sometime in the future, it deserves it.

It's finally here.
A game that's almost everything I expect.
A naval battle, a bull spider cult similar to what we know it with Ghost Recon-Wildlands
system of mercenaries who haunts you on every corner.
Challenges The Amazons who want to catch mythological mythical animals,
Great battles between Sparta and Athena
Few improved graphics compared to Original's predecessor
I have the game set to max to be just full HD more my monitor does not yet play but the game goes smoothly and looks amazing
There is a wonderful world full of animals and diverse rivers, streams, lakes, the green mountains full of flowers.
The only thing that spoils me with the impression of fighting is that I've figured out how to kill any mercenary without contacting them and this stupid artificial intelligence will soon be repaired.
There are plenty of options for hunters to make nice pictures and I can only recommend the game.

Finally managed to finish the whole game. (There are still a few quests left in The Lost Tales of Greece, but all DLCs and main/side-quests are done).

I see a lot of people blame to game for micro-transactions. I don't like them either, but I don't agree with the fact that you need to buy XP boosters or any other stuff to enjoy the game.
Some of the cosmetics are really cool (others I find to be a bit over-the-top), but I do like the Horse Skins:).
In any event, the game provides so many armours: Epic, Legendary, etc that you don't need to spend a dime on the shop.

Back to the game: I found the way the story is related is quite enjoyable and better than any of the previous AC games. The addition of cut-scenes and dialogue options is a step in the right direction.

I loved the Altantis DLC and I think the Legacy of the First Blade was an OK dlc (and I didn't have any problems with the story - only that maybe they tried to make a bit more dramatic than it should have been).

The combat is fun and responsive (if you know what you are doing and don't just go smacking buttons).

The class system is a welcome addition. By the end of the game you will get all the skills unlocked, have all the legendary armour which will allow you to basically play either as an assassin or warrior or hunter in the same time. All you have to do is swap the armour (there are presets that allow you to do this) and you can either storm a fort as a warrior, be the bad-ass hunter and execute everyone with arrows or be ninja assassin that we all love:)

I noticed some people blame the wrong pacing of the game. I think the pacing is right, if you don't get side-tracked by all the exploration too much and BOY this game screams of exploration all over it:) (Which I highly enjoyed).

Regarding materials, yes the game can became very grindy. I found out, that instead of trying to level up my armour every single level, if I do it every 5 levels instead, I never had issues with materials, if I also dismantle all the items I get along the way and I don't need. I think this is the only aspect of the game where you need to be really tactical about it and have a longer term strategy, otherwise you will have to grind for materials.

Overall, I had a lot of fun with it and now that I finished it, I am thinking of playing it again from zero. (Yes, it has a NG+ mode as well - but I love unlocking all my skills again, looking for the better armour, upgrading and so on as I like to be tactical as in an RPG).

Is not a perfect game, but is definitely a very good game and I had a great time with it.
Just don't expect a 30 hours game. It will take you around 170 hours to fully finish the main game quests + side-quests + DLCS while exploring and discovering the whole map (I still have a few ? (less than 10) and I haven't cleared every single fort, but around 90% is fully completed).

I recommend it, if you like the AC universe, the game setting (Ancient Greece) and you are not intimidated by the time it needs to be completed :)

EDIT: After overcoming the AVX issue by buying a new CPU, I found that this game lived up to the hype (at least for me) and has a compelling story, amazing graphics and cool historical locations that made my jaw drop (like Odysseus's palace). This game completely changed what the Assassin's Creed franchise looks like in my eyes and has given me a new hope for future games to come. It improves on gameplay features previously introduced (like naval battles, which are much more fun now) and introduces new combat features well. Overall, I would say this game was worth the buy, just make sure that you look around on the internet a decent amount before hand instead of just basing system compatibility with the minimum requirements on the steam page.


ORIGINAL REVIEW: I was so hyped up for this game that I even pre-ordered it, which is something I don't usually do. When I went to launch it on the release day, it kept crashing after all of the company logos played on a computer that I know can easily run it, which meant that I didn't even get to see the AC title screen. The issue is that this game, like many other Ubisoft games, REQUIRES A CPU THAT SUPPORTS AVX. Since there are so many good cpus out there that don't support AVX and since so many people are having this issue, hopefully Ubisoft will release a patch that makes the game support other CPUs, like they've done with games like AC: Origins and The Crew 2. Until Then, I can't recommend this game.

Short review- Reminds me of the witcher, there's a ♥♥♥♥ load to do and the game is absolutely stunning. The game mechanics work well, there's finally a difficulty settings so the games no longer a walk in the park. Although it doesn't seem to be very well optimized. I have a 1070ti and at max settings i get an average 70fps. If you like the eitcher/stealth games, you'll really like Assassins creed Odyssey.

I love this game. As an infrequent AC player since the first installment, (I missed most of the entries after Black Flag until Origins), AC Odyssey is just the kind of game I want to play. I accept this game is not for everyone, but for me, the bottom line is Ubisoft has lovingly rendered the world of Ancient Greece in absolutely stunning detail and glory. The ancient Greece of AC Odyssey is a world I love spending time in, and anything I can do to stay in the world longer is worth my time. I play games to escape, and playing as the hero Kassandra is one of the best escapes in my recent memory.

I would rate very highly the armor and perk system. I like being able to tune builds for the three different play-styles, or combine for my own personal take. I've enjoyed the writing of the stories and quests. I found the quest-line where I could fight the mythical beasts particularly fun. I enjoy the combat system, first introduced in Origins, and further refined in this installment. It feels like a really solid Action-RPG combat system, and is much more rewarding to me than the combat systems of previous AC games. I appreciate that the enemies put up an actual fight instead of going down in one hit. Also, Kassandra is a simply amazing character. I place her up with Comm. Shephard as far as strong single-player game leads are concerned.

For cons, yes, this game can get repetitive. I don't care, though, because like I said, I enjoy spending time in the world so much it doesn't matter. I'm happy to have things to do. What is also frustrating is that stealth kills are not at all guaranteed to be one-hit-kills. To me this is the primary way this game goes against the AC formula. I would change the stealth kill ability to be more of a sure thing in future games. I see complaints that this game is system intensive; yes, you need a fairly beefy system to run this well, but that is because your computer is literally simulating this massive world all it once, every time you play it. I think it's incredible that our computers have the ability to do this at all.

I would recommend this game if you like the general Ubisoft style of games. That is, lots of icons on the screen, lots of tasks to complete, and perhaps a map that is a little too large. If you want a story rich Action-RPG that has a rich world and lots to do, look no further. If the holo-deck from ST every becomes reality, I want an experience on there to be like this game. Just with me in Kassandra's boots!

I'll start with the pros:
- Graphics are good (nothing amazing, but good).
- Characters are likeable and their voice acting is generally good
- Story is engaging
- Naval combat is back and fun

But the cons just kill the game for me:
- "Time Saver" microtransactions. They're not even trying to hide the fact that they're going for a quick cash-grab anymore.
- Combat just feels broken. Time to kill is absolutely rediculous. Player does basically no damage to enemies the same level as them with the same level gear, but enemies do massive damage to player. And that's on normal difficulty.
- Assassinations aren't guaranteed instant kills for enemies of the same level, defeating the purpose of spending time sneaking up on a target.
- Leveling is slow, unlike Origins. Origins almost felt like leveling was too fast, but Odyssey feels way too slow. Constantly feeling underpowered.
- Performance is quite poor. My overclocked 4790K and 1080TI (in a custom watercooling loop) can barely maintain 60 FPS at 1440p in populated areas on a mix of High and Ultra settings. CPU gets really hot (over 65C), which I attribute to the DRM, just like in Origins.

Most of my dismay lies with the combat system. I don't buy an AC game to play as a tank character, but that's basically the build you have to make to survive combat in this game. With enemies being as tanky as they are, blatant cash-grab microtransactions, and poor level pacing I really can't recommend the game. Its a shame because the story seems really good so far compared to the last few games, but being unable to make it through combat with enemies the same level as you makes it incredibly frustrating to make any story progress.

This game starts out pretty well with a mystery and beautiful landscape but after 20 or so hours or about a third into the game this becomes a chore to play. The game starts to have no depth to it with terrible written script as well as decisions to the point where it starts to hurt my head trying to make the game make sense. Even the dlc is just straight up copy of the main story for legacy of the first blade and has the same setup in the fate of Atlantis dlc as well. It is all just explore an area and kill some guys with 4-7 main missions and you're done, no in depth story and no actual play time of the dlc. This whole game as well as the dlc just feels like a bunch of side quests not even worth finishing. So many main missions split into three main (side) missions which then again split into three more making 9 missions. You can finish one and get all the information you need but still need to do the other 8 even if they give no information to the story or none at all. Ubisoft clearly does not know who to make a proper rpg. Not to mention the terrible level balancing of the game and everything becoming a bullet sponge as well as 1 to 2 hitting you. Fun gameplay. Not to mention the great mercenary system that they definitely didn't take aspirations from shadow of mordor and completely fail. You get punished for doing what you are told to do in either story missions or side quests and get mercenaries on you that are even more bullet sponges and have a higher stance to 1 to 2 hit you, making completely not fun to even attempt to play the story.

If you want to waste time and money or looking for a basic and intro to rpg this game should work. But if you are looking for a good game with great rpg aspect this is not it.

First time I've felt obligated to write a brief review because this is the first time a 'very positive' overall steam rating hasn't felt deserved.

At its core AC Odyssey is a very polished, beautiful pseudo-historic open world playground for exploration, questing, and enjoyable combat. Its pacing is awful - the leveling system, the storytelling, the travel time. The game is also insanely repetitive like an MMO (the game even features its own store that would shame a F2P MMO store) but without grind enjoyment.

Most of the time you'll find yourself not doing any of the enjoyable aspects of the game like combat or stealth. Instead, you'll be traveling or in dialogue. The reason for this is because the insane amount of quests in this game are single objective quests that are fine until you realize just how tedious they are.

First, every quest puts you into dialogue, which after awhile just tells the same story.. i.e. You will go fetch something or kill something or clear something. Its cool that all the quests have a personality except any chat choice you make is pointless. Then, you have to travel ungodly distances because for some reason all the fast travel locations are sparse. Not only that, every fast travel spot is a tower that you have to jump off of - which means more time tediously jumping off - listening to the classic AC bird screeching while landing in a pile of grass. Take Athens, for instance, where they put one fast travel spot in the center of the largest city in the game. You need to 1. jump down from the tower. 2. jump down from the top of the acropolis BEFORE you even start off on the horse - which moves SLOWER in cities... its a 1-2 minutes to get to your quest giver, 1-2 minutes to talk, 2-3 minutes to then fast travel and jump off of a fast travel tower and onto a road and then its 2-5 minutes to horse over to your destination, where you spend 5-10 minutes doing something fun... THEN ITS BACK TO TRAVELING AROUND AND TALKING REEEE.

So, sitting in pointless dialogue, tediously fast travelling, jumping off the tower, having to run (typically jump down more rocks) to the nearest road, summoning your horse, then going to the mission, where all you have to do is usually kill something which puts you in combat for 2 minutes with 2-5 mins of stealth/using your bird vision. In the end, travel time and wasted time is 80% of the time a player will spend in this game. The other 20% is fantastic. Ubisoft wanted to make $$$ so they stuffed it full of roadblocks and levelgates that make you want to head to the store.. the goalposts have been elongated just for the sake of tempting gamers with microtransactions than actually rewarding them.

The failure of Assassin's Creed Odyssey boils down to there simply being too much game— an excess of sprawling, unfocused content. If the map were condensed to the more interesting areas and missions were pared down to story-focused quests, there might be a worthwhile game somewhere in here. Instead, Assassin's Creed Odyssey feels more like being forced to complete busywork between the more interesting bits (even when the more interesting bits still involve the same tired gameplay). And with a host of impossible missions that fill up your quest log that you can't attempt without hours of grinding first, playing Odyssey feels less like a fun game and more like a slog.

Compare this to benchmarks like DA:O, GTA, Witcher, and ME. It is most close to Witcher but unlike AC Odyssey, the Witcher had pacing and interesting dialogue. I've gone 20-30 minutes REGULARLY in AC Odyssey doing nothing but talking, traveling, talking again, and traveling back. I thought DA:I was filled with bloat, but this game really takes the cake.

TLDR: THE GAME IS A CHORE. The scale and pace is way off - you spend WAY more time walking around and in dry uninteractive dialogue rather than being a mercenary. Those that say there is 500+ hours of content are lying to themselves. Its 50-80 hrs of fresh feeling quality content with obsessives playing 500+, which is great for the price I got the game. However, this game was not a very positive or positive experience.

Like Assassins Creed Origins, except much much bigger, and you have ships! Black flag was awesome, upgradeable ships are back, Yay! I will upgrade my archers, and upgrade my spears.... and then not use either as I ram people to death!

I personally don't mind playing games with weak graphics. So bad graphics wouldn't bother me... That said, this game has amazing graphics. I had to turn them down for fear of being sucked back in time through my magic picture device. Okay... so it doesn't look that real... but it does look damn good!

At time of writing this review, I'm only around 30 hours in. (28.8) But it's my second day, gimme a break. I've done loads of the game already, and it just keeps revealing more stuff I can do. On top of that, there are repeatable quests (Which are voiced, of course. Unlike... some lesser games...) Huge areas to explore. I did a side quest, a little quest in the middle of nowhere. It wound up splitting into three other quests, which went on to more quests. As I freed slaves, got a family killed, and kicked a guy off a mountain. It was all good.... Except for the family.... Oh well.



I love this game. It's great.

I'd like to say though, to anyone complaining about the cash shop, don't buy anything, that way you won't lose any money, makes sense, right?
Not like you're losing out on much, the game is HUGE, MASSIVE! MASSIVELY HUGE! HASSIVELY MUGE!... Wait, those aren't words.
The microtransactions aren't very useful either. Sure, you can buy in game currency... or you can ram down a few ships with your boat and become rich in a few minutes. I know what I'd choose. Microtransactions are there for people who have money and don't like having fun. Pay no mind to them.

Note: I don't know what I was on while I wrote this, when the game first game out there weren't quite so many Microtransactions. The sheer amount of them now is crazy, even if you buy the ultimate version of the game, there's a lot of them. It can feel like the game is incomplete because you don't have them, and you're perfectly 100% right to feel like that. You can unlock them by doing weeklies and buying a pot from a merchant with Orchicalum. But even then it's only a chance. It's not a very good chance either. But at least there's a chance. There are worse monetizations out there and there are far better ones. But the game aside from this is still a really enjoyable game. So I still recommend buying the game.

I loved this game. I still do to a degree.

BE WARNED: The Torment of Hades DLC has a game breaking bug that removes all quests from the game. While the core game is really polished, the DLC began in the wrong spot for me and now all quests are missing from the entire game. hope they fix this.

I'll change the review if they fix it.

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is an open world RPG with stealth elements and one of the newer Assassin’s Creed titles. It is also a game that I didn’t want to play.

The game’s reputation was pretty bad as far as I knew. Many people liked Origins much better and while I grew to enjoy that one as I loved its world, I wasn’t really satisfied with the story and soon found side quests to be boring and repetitive. So from my own experience, I feared Odyssey would be more of the same, especially since the setting is quite similar, considering the Greek influences in Egypt.
From other people’s experience - reviews, videos and stuff - I also feared that it would be very grindy and hard to keep my character at the required level without microtransactions.
All in all, Odyssey didn’t sound very appealing to me and I let many a Steam sale pass by without touching it.
Until the last one. I don’t exactly know what it was, it was a rather spontaneous decision to maybe give it a try before Valhalla releases. I bought the game, not expecting much, and I can say that I don’t regret it at all.

First of all: Yes, it doesn’t really add much to the overall assassin storyline of the series and I understand that there are people who are looking for that specifically and that they might be disappointed. I’ve played some of the older ones as well and they have a certain feel to them that definitely isn’t there in the newer titles. Everyone has to decide for themselves whether that’s necessarily a bad thing. Odyssey is more of an RPG that lets you play a stealthy playstyle. That’s something you should consider if you’re buying for the Assassin’s Creed rather than the Odyssey.

Apart from that, the game is nothing of what I feared, and much more than I expected. quest design has been much improved upon since Origins. To me the main story is way more engaging than it was in Origins, same goes for side quests, and it wasn’t that difficult to meet the level requirements to progress. There’s a lot of stuff to do in the world, and it felt much better structured than it did in Origins.
I enjoyed my experience with Odyssey from beginning to end, it never felt grindy. I enjoyed clearing locations and doing side stuff way more than I thought I would, and not once did I feel exhausted or overwhelmed as I often do at some point in RPGs.
Combat is fun, the abilities are fun, as is the overall gameplay.
Storywise it is not a masterpiece but it’s solid and kept me interested.
Performance was stable most of the time, though I had two game crashes, some rare stuttering and fps drops and one or two bugs.
Graphics are beautiful, as is the music.

I played as Kassandra and I really liked her. Some people say the protagonists are bland and not consistent - and yes, depending on how you play I can definitely see that happening. Still I cannot confirm that from my own experience. Odyssey is the first game in the series that lets you make choices and shape your character to some extent, and so everyone might feel a bit differently about that.

While Origins was a story about revenge, Odyssey was more of a story about forgiveness - at least the way I played it - and that made for a nice change for me.

I wouldn’t say AC Odyssey is outstanding in any aspect, but it is a good game, and I had a lot of fun playing it. So all I can say in conclusion is that I recommend the game without any hesitation.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey's greatest strength is its protagonist, misthios Kassandra (portrayed wonderfully by Melissanthi Mahut), and her many wonderful adventures in the ancient Greek world. Even in the dullest moments of Odyssey -- and there were quite a few -- I always found myself compelled to complete whatever I had in my quest inbox just so that she can become that much more powerful, more in tune with her destiny. Through the base game, two DLCs and a final good-bye note in the form of the island Korfu (in which I shed a few tears), one gets to see the most ferocious brawn and the most tender emotions of Kassandra. She's easily a contender for my top 5 video game characters... so charismatic, so well-portrayed.

Odyssey is vast, almost to a fault (it took me 221 hours to finish everything in one playthrough, after all), and its activities are often repetitive... but there's always an incentive to keep going, always a silver lining. The magical abilities we can use are fascinating, and the various locales of ancient Greece are breathtaking to look at. Legacy of the First Blade is underrated, The Fate of Atlantis provides both the most fascinating and emotional moments of the entire game, and the island of Korfu gives us a small area of respite. I rolled my eyes when it started to become another grand-scale adventure, but it was in a way akin to how one would roll their eyes at a mildly annoying sibling. You can't help but love them in the end.

Farewell, misthios. It's been fun.

Alot of reviews are saying greed by micro transactions. You can completely ignore all the micro transactions. Nothing is difficult or blocked or unbeatable by not buying anything. This is probably the best AC game I've played since black flag.

This game is amazing and freaking HUGE! There is so much content, always something to do, explore and delve. The ship battles are amazing and very nostalgic to the thrill of those found in Black Flag. The bounty hunters that hunt you in the world are similar to that of those found in the Shadow of War series. The story driven narrative and choices that bare consequence is that of the Witcher. If you're a fan of any of these games then you're definitely going to enjoy this one. I will admit, it does all these things well but it's these traits aren't as good as the ones that emphasized it. The game comes off as a jack of all trades but a master at none. That being said it's not like it does any of them badly. They're just not perfect as the. With so much content and so much to do there is definitely something here for everyone, highly recommend this game!

Absolutely stunning graphics. If you love ancient Greece, you will love just exploring the wilds and cities displayed here. The acting is fine by me, I loooove Alexios's accent. The best part is the combat. I don't miss the old AC style one bit. Archery is amazing, you can freaking control arrows in mid-flight. The weapons feel good. The combat trees are mostly great.

It's just a fun, gorgeous, if slightly underwhelming on the quest side romp through ancient Greece. Definitely don't miss this game.

It appears you may need to lose attachment to previous AC games however, looking at the low ratings. This game does not deserve low ratings and all of them are coming from people looking to disgrace the company by giving low ratings rather than rating the game for what it is. Shameful practice.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is not an Assassin's Creed game.

The only thing this game has in common with any other games in the series is the name and the Isu, which has always really been in the background of most other AC games.

Before I get into my main review of this game, I just want to point out that AC Origins did a very good job explaining the 'origins' of the AC Brotherhood, and on top of that while Origins did have some mythological elements, they were implemented through DLC and were explained as hallucinations brought about by the pieces of Eden.

Compared to Origins, Odyssey is a slap in the face of what it means to be an AC game:

- Mythology plays a big part of the game, and you fight mythological creatures as part of the story, 

- There is a large focus on the Isu, and it really contradicts what is known about the Isu from previous games. The Isu aren't some mysterious Godly human-predecessors, but are really just petty magicians (especially if you play the Fate of Atlantis DLC).

- Origins explained the birth of the Brotherhood, but this game is set way before Origins takes place, so there isn't any mention of the Hidden Ones or Order of the Ancients (outside of a DLC), and really the Cult of Kosmos (the Templar equivalent in this game) has nothing to do with any AC lore.

- Layla Hassan is incredibly unlikable. In Origins, she didn't have much to do with the story and was a pretty forgettable character, but I guess I'd describe her as a boring Lara Croft. In Odyssey, she is an incredibly annoying, arrogant weird hipster, who would make sense as a side character in Watch Dogs 2, but doesn't really seem to belong in an AC game.

- The game is too arcadey. Compared to previous games like Unity, with proper, well-flushed out and somewhat realistic mechanics, this game just feels like it lacks substance. You can dance and dodge around 15 foes and take them all out without being hit once and you just float and jump around everywhere you go like you have wings. It just doesn't seem to belong to an AC game.

- Finally, the story. Past AC games have been known for their complicated, thought-provoking stories, but the story in Odyssey is just not worthy of its namesake. Furthermore, although I'd consider this game more a quasi-RPG than a real RPG like Kingdom Come or the Witcher games, you shouldn't really have the ability to make game-altering decisions in an AC game. The whole premise of AC games is that you are accessing someones memories, not making your own memories of people that died thousands of years ago.

Most of the issues I listed above are issues I'd say only people who have actually played other AC games would share with me. If this is your first AC game, you wouldn't pick up on a lot of this so it would be really irrelevant. If this is your first AC game, though, and you really enjoyed it and want to delve further into the series, be prepared to either be very disappointed or pleasantly surprised, because from mechanics to story and lore, all other AC games are very different to Odyssey. If you, like me, have played the other games and are familiar with the lore, you will find yourself very disappointed with this game.

I did my home-work here to help you during the current open-world sellings. I loved it at first but I uninstalled it before finishing. The game has a strong start and fun fights, but so easy to get exhausted of what surrounds it; it isn't very dense and can feel cheap. My final conclusion is only buy the main game to make sure it is worthy and only buy it during discounts. A barrage of plot holes and immersion slaughter moments awaits. If you don't take it seriously you probably can withstand it.

AC Odyssey got everything good and bad from Ubisoft

There is microtransaction in-game hoping for you to accept them. Game's big, but big is not always better. It feels rather stretched, like little butter in too much bread. There is something called "time savers" in the Ubisoft store to "help" ease it, proving they did it intentionally or they knew gameplay would worn off fast.

Why I recommend it

Because of Kassandra. She's likeable, the voice actress is a piece of ass and I'm sure most of us lesbians and trans finds her hot, its not just me. That's a plus that must count.

The mercenaries tier system is by far the reason why I played it. Forget about the empty rewards, constant level up or confusing family story. It's all about the thrill of a hard mode fight.

I miss AC 1 Templar soldiers hiding around maps that used to be so unique. That old concept evolved, it resembles the Nemesis system; as you keep trolling, NPCs will send mercenaries after you but they're not the usual dumb asse𝘴 you meet. It can become a vicious cat-mouse hunt that can show up anywhere and brake your plans, if you can't fight you better pay off the bounty or just try to find who hired the merc. I managed to bloat the queue so bad that some merc joined others to take me down, resulting in a 25 minutes clash to defeat them, I wasn't ready with my equipment. I still consider the mercs to be a legitimate threat not easy to get rid off.

𝗖𝗢𝗡𝗙𝗨𝗦𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗣𝗥𝗢𝗦

Music sometimes does a better artistic job than the rest of the game, specially high-end fighting and ship combat. It even strikes the old vibes as if AC mysteries still lives somewhere. (it doesn't)

Conversation cutscenes are enjoyable at first, it is even human and tender. What I hate is the modern mannerism so incompatible with the time period, not always the ideal but the "best" you'll get from Ubisoft.

Voice acting for fighting is satisfying. Deep-breathing, groaning in pain and enemy taunts. Unfortunatelly the main character often talks alone trying to make effortless quests sounding cool. Some sounds lacks details, when you're bare feet or carrying heavy weapons.

Cities, land masses and the sea are all beautiful - but it totally lacks variation - it can be really repetitive. Human body is well depicted but body language is middle term. At least facial expressions are not-ME-Andromeda.

I never played Odyssey for its story. The Animus part is minimal, trying the Lara Croft's thing or something. All that "finding my mother" stuff sometimes goes nowhere, missions are absolutelly repetitive no matter the backstory. It is a perpetual fetch-quest that doesn't convince me to keep going from point A to B because I can predict what will be the "outcome" of the quest.

I like the stealth because the A.I. aren't just a bunch of dummies waiting next bush. You gotta think before you act, cause distractions. They even report to higher officials and split groups. Thanks to that, it takes a while before becoming repetitive (but it will).

Fighting goes by RPG-action so expect critical numbers. Some tough enemies won't die with headshot bows not even off helmet. You must maintain things, the problem is that you will level up very constantly. When you can finally keep it up, it is time to work the blades again and again.

Why things slowly accumulated into cons

Sometimes fighting a guard in the streets may trigger NPC reactions you would see in games from 1996. Normal people can start attacking you armed with nothing but a BROOM. Funny because hammering a crumbling old lady arꜱe will also depend on critical chances, it looks rather ridiculous. Even a fakking CHICKEN can get angry and fight you (and win) crushing your gameplay goals into a pathetic xith show. Funny at first, very annoying after 60 hours watching it.

Romancing characters is never satisfying, there are no real consequences and you can't keep 'em going.

You can climb anything anywhere, no skills required, no limitations to challenge you, not even gravity after some skills.

The game decides when to take your weapons out of the holster, when enemies are around. It is intrusive and irritating after hours of gameplay.

It is easier to accept plot-holes than such violent immersion breaking promotional propaganda. The plot doesn't know where and how to place science fiction and/or magical mythologies, and often sounds as if it doesn't matter.

I like the sailing as I said, it can be fun and with the music. But classical civilizations had sailing steering much harder than middle age and renaissance, except for the Han Dynasty on China around the first century, it was mostly about muscles and rowing. Maneuverability has no historical accuracy because the game doesn't need it, weird direction that is and that sucks for me. This isn't Black Desert, this is supposed to be AC. Your crew also do shanties even though it was nonexistent for sailing in that age. They shouldn't be repeating Black Flag's in every time period.

No headgear on cutscenes, when people asked for it, the developers gave them a temper tantrum.

You still can't have a shore party, only the ''call to arms'' ability.

Controls are weird sometimes, you'll be constantly grabbing ledges when you just wanted to turn left. I still don't understand how my character can do professional parkour in the cooper age without any training, wasting a good opportunity to explain it.

A DLC called "First blade" is a repetition of the main story, only with new characters (that won't match any timeline, causing further dumb plot holes)

Can't turn specific hints off. "Untame animal" is one of them. It is beyond annoying after 60 hours straight and yes, developers refused to fix it with another tantrum on Ubi's forums.

You can't interact with some romantic interests like Odessa, can't interact with the world. You can't give tips, can't pet tammed animals, sit on benches or around the fire.

Horse disappears too fast for a 2018 game. I have seen better horse riding mechanics in older games.

Odyssey is the most asinine with the microtransaction bullxith I have ever seen. The damn "T for Store" keeps showing up even on Layla notebook during the animus part. Ubisoft really wants extra money no matter what the cost. I found Sargon, some in-game merchant talking about Orichalcum, some sort of Battlefront 2 crystals. You rarely find the damn Orichalcum and when you do find it - enough it is not - for what his special items requires.

There's a weekly quest called "Tummy troubles'' that requires items to activate dialogues without warning you first. The quest immediately fails a second after fake activating it. This is how low it can get to be.

Final score: 6/10

My mistake is when I decided to explore too much before finishing the game. The game only has two things for me, a strong girl and bloody fights. Nothing else.

Assassin's Witcher's Creed: The Wild Odyssey
AC: Odyssey doesn't even try to hide its similarities to Witcher 3 and I am completely fine with it. Of course, it is still not as good as W3, but haven't seen any game except this one, that could actually come close to it.
Plus points for the absolutely gorgeous graphics!

Props to the devs, because I disliked nearly all AC games so far, but damn... 'Odyssey' is a lot of fun!

Beautiful game and world to explore set in the ancient greek world recreated in every little detail.
Haven't played an AC title in years,but i totally recommend this one,even if now is more an action rpg then anything.

Cons:
Its get a little repetitive after a while,apart from the main story,you are always doing the same thing(some secondary quests are really interesting tho.)
Not really historically accurate in some regards(Inclusive Revisionism)

Great game. Crappy micro-transaction scheme. Want to pay to keep your favorite gear leveled? Prepare for a massive repetitive grind....or pay $$ not to. Ubisoft should not get a pass for this, hold them to the same stadard as EA on this crap.

Disclaimer: I will rewrite this review soon, so it would match my current standards.

The very best Assassin's Creed game to this day which improves a lot but it still has flaws.

Gameplay

The core of the gameplay is the same as in Origins. You need to level up your character in order to kill enemies with higher level and the rest of the world uses a level-scaling with your character and ship. You don't use shield this time, but you are equipped with the Spear of Leonidas which works like the broken sword in Shadow of Mordor. There are more abilities for every style of combat. I must say that I really had fun with the Spartan kick ability.
Stealth has more abilities too but unfortunately, the AI is again quite stupid and you can easily take out the whole camps without a problem. AI shows its retardation in combat when they're capable of setting themselves on fire by running through it or throw bombs at each other.
Now you have 5 pieces of armor instead of one suit, which is a great improvement (similar to Unity) and you can even change the look of every armor in inventory. It's like fashion souls now.
Cultist mechanic is a great addition and I would like to see this system again in the future with few tweaks and improvements.
Ships are back, yay! You can have 4 lieutenants which improve your ship with % bonuses and can board the enemy boats with you. Unfortunately, one legendary greek polemarch is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and always kill or cripple himself (lieutenants are fine after the battle so don't worry). But I would like to see the ships more improved, like more visual upgrades, the interior of the ship and more. It's just one of the "downgrades" from Black Flag. Sure, the lieutenants are a nice addition but that's all. You also cannot hit the rocks, islands land and the ship has auto-heal. It's great to have ships again, but I feel that it was better in Black Flag.
You can help Sparta or Athens to win the province. It will launch a conquest battle which is just one big chaotic massacre. On the islands, it's often a ship battle. It's a great and new addition but I would like to see more strategy in it.
Mercenary system is similar to Shadow of Mordor. The mercenaries are randomly generated after while with their own weakness and abilities.
Mythical creatures as boss battles are better than in the Origins.

Story and quests

I think that story is ok. It has good, maybe even great moments but it also has some stupid scenes both in the historical and modern part of the game. The endings were quite a 
I am gonna write my opinion of choices into another spoiler window, it won't contain any spoilers from the quests or story, but if you're wanna be surprised if your choices have meaning or not - don't read it. 
You can choose between Kassandra and Alexios. I must say that Kassandra is now my favorite protagonist in the AC series. Her voice acting, animations and reactions were absolutely great. The dialogue options also help with forming her character.
Sidequests are on the same level as in Origins. But thanks to the characters like Alkibiades or Sokrates I enjoyed it more. One sidequest surprised me with its depth - .
There is also much more humor and I had a good laugh sometimes.

World, graphics, and sounds

The world is bigger than in Origins and is beautiful. There are many Greek city-states under the control of Athens or Sparta and all of them has it's unique structure. I must say that on Ultra settings it's probably the best looking open world game on the PC right now. It's again filled with military camps, legendary animals, caves, shipwrecks...
Unfortunately, the tombs are the second "big downgrade" from previous games. They are all same with few differences and without any puzzle or something. You just kill dozens of snakes. That's a shame.
The soundtrack is an improvement. I felt that it was weak in Origins and it's quite good now.

Microtransactions
You can safely play the game without microtransactions as in Origins. People probably never played any RPG or I don't know why are they surprised that you sometimes have to complete a sidequest to get an XP points. It was the same in Origins.
But I still don't like it's a presence there and I won't use them - you shouldn't too if you don't want to get it worse in the future games.
The "haha" joke on EA in one of the sidequests is hypocrisy at its finest when you have smaller chance to get items from microtransactions in this game than in Battlefront 2.

Updates and future content
I must say that the plan for updating the game both with free and paid content is looking really promising and Ubisoft is listening to its a community, so that's a big thumb up from me.

Game is Horribly optimized. But i love Assassin's creed so Much that i owned a series of every single Assassin's creed game almost 97% collection.

As im giving more time in gameplay, im liking it so much. About the optimisation, no worries, ubisoft aware of it im sure and they are working on it, as this is just a 1st day of a launch, every day passes the improvments we will see same as with origins did.

There is still many content remaining to see in oddysey, for a season pass.

To make your game playable, just tweaks some settings here and there, to low such as clouds, you will get boost in performance. And yes game looks very beautiful. For more Information, Check out this Video in Youtube it will help you alot-->

My Pc is even not meeting a minimum requirements still i purchased ultimate edition xD, im having a Gtx 970 and i3 4th Gen processor 😁.

Yesterday after i saw that horrible performance and low fps, i uninstalled the game 😶. And got sad depressed, i have no money to buy new build as of now, so i thought to uninstall it and let it play once i upgraded my Pc for better stable gameplay.

But today morning, as i cannot stay like that as a fan of series lol, i again install it today and im playing fine with between 30 to 60fps and im happy for that. Game is very enjoyable, there is many side quests, exploration, you can say more polished and more improvements towards origins.

I haven't loved a game set in a place frequently confused with Rome this much since Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. I haven't loved an Assassin's Creed game this much since Assassin's Creed Brotherhood either.

This game is amazing. I got about 100 hours in before I realised I hadn't even gotten halfway through the main story. Get this game if you like FUN. Don't get this game if you hate bossfights that are essentially just regular enemies who are slightly harder to kill.

9.5/10. If Ubisoft keeps making games this great, I'd be happy to keep ignoring their cash-grabbing microtransactions for a bunch of useless malaka that doesn't really have any effect on the overall enjoyment of the game.

I wish there was a neutrel option. I didn't want to give this game a "Not recomended". It's an all around good game, only don't fall for their money grabby nonsense. If you want the game, just get the base game and you'll have alot of fun, there is no need to shill over extra money for the super krabby patty deluxe with chocolate sprinkles edition for $399.99

Combat is fun and dynamic with the envirnment. Story is interesting with memorable characters, and a plot that isn't primarily about the over done "the world is ending" we see so much. That was a breathe of fresh air. I didn't have any bugs either. The grind was there but it wasn't overwhelming to me.

That being said, the buisness practises we see here are disgusting. (That's why I didn't recomend it) Microtransactions in a full priced game, 4 editions, and this episodic DLC stuff, they want games to be a service. They want you constantly forking over your money.

TL;DR : Great game made by great game developers, sadly poisoned with microtransactions. If you can look past the microtransaction store, and like games like dragon age, or The Witcher 3, get it. If you can't, don't.

It's a beautiful game: the water effects are gorgeous, the clouds are amazing, the landscapes are breathtaking. As a tech demo it's absolutely exquisite. The problem is that despite this incredible open world there's really only one thing you can do in it, which is to run up to people (or, okay, sometimes sneak up on people) and beat them to death. Over and over and over. Your stats go up, their stats go up, Alcibiades makes a pass at somebody. As a twenty, thirty hour campaign I'd be okay with this, but when it's bloated with layers of fetch quests, daily quests, a mercenary league, a network of conspirators to uncover - all of which amount to running up to someone and mashing the attack and roll buttons until they fall over - it gets old fast.

The highest compliment I can give the game is that it genuinely makes me want to go to Greece, and do something - anything - other than have a killing spree.

Can't recommend this game enough!

I haven't followed with the recent Assassins creed games, revelations was the last I played, but after that I heard they started to get more repetitive and lack diversity. AC origins was the first game to completely change things and become more of an RPG game than its predecessors, and when I heard about it and saw gameplay of it, it looked intriguing, I never purchased it however but after I complete this I may do due to my experience with this.

While this game only came out a year later than origins its clear to see its been developed far more than you'd think and treated with love and care, I decided to purchase it a couple days ago during the Lunar sale for £25, I chose this over AC origins mainly because I like Greek history a lot more over Egyptian and even if there is only one year difference between there releases, this game is sure to have any changes from feedback of there newer RPG mechanics and the game just looked very promising in general.

And boy was I right, so far this has been one of the best Singleplayer games I have played in a long time, the story is very engaging and the free roam aspects are breathtaking, the new RPG system over the old games is a great changeup in the series and one I hope continues for the foreseeable future and while many people argue "it's not assassins creed" I would say maybe it's not in a traditional sense of being a hooded assassin and killing enemys with a hidden blade but it is clear to see when you play it feels just like an assassins creed game and you quickly dismiss this criticism. AC odyssey feels right at home and many traditional aspects are still there such as stealth kills, climbing buildings, synchronizing viewpoints before jumping off, etc.

This is Assassins creed, how it should be. I'm surprised its recent reviews are 'mixed'

The only criticism I can think of its perhaps the optimisation I have a 1070ti but run the game at med-high settings but only achieve around 40-55 fps in most circumstances although it may be my older I5600k holding me back however I shouldn't think it would that much. I haven't really seen optimisation brought up that much as an issue so could be mainly on my end, I might just have to tweak the options as some potentially FPS draining settings may still be active and I just haven't played around with it enough yet.

My complete specs for those interested:
Asus Z170 Pro motherboard
Intel Skylake i5 6600k 3.5ghz quad-core processor
EVGA Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070ti
16gb Corsair Vengeance DDR4 RAM
120gb SSD (main)
1TB HDD Storage Space (secondary)
NZXT Phantom 410 Orange mid tower case
Windows 10 Home 64-bit

TLDR: I have had the game for two nights and already 20 hours in with plenty more to go! I can't recommend this game enough if you like open world games, AC games, Greek mythology or anything really, it's amazing! Hours fly by when I 'm playing this, It's one of my favourite singleplayer experiences I have played in a long time, great job ubisoft.

The game contains some of the most fantastic graphics I've seen. I would totally recommend it to everyone who's looking for a killer set of graphics and photography.
Talking about gameplay, things aren't what I was expecting. The game offers multiple playstyles but demands being actually stealthy, doing assassinations, stealing or murdering even if you like to be a warrior or a hunter. I'f you like sneaking and infiltrate then this game is for you. Others may find graphics more appealing to their taste.

I am playing on a laptop, and have a GTX 1050 Ti and i7-7700k and was crashing every 5-15 minutes of gameplay. The issue seemed to be an NVIDIA Power Management option for "Optimal Power" - after changing that to "Prefer Maximum Performance" I was able to play for 9 hours straight without crashing (and I turned my graphics settings back up). Now, I'm finally enjoying the game.

Ubisoft:
A right and proper publisher, only, it developed a habit of devouring wallets..
They made it a Lord of Publishing. Not for virtue, but for money.
Such is capitalism, I suppose. But here I ask. Do we have a sodding chance?

What an amazing, bloated game. I’ll start with the negatives since I kept a Note on my iphone full of them:
-very hilly and water centric terrain makes traversal slow
-story is poorly acted, directed, and explained
-doing things out of sequences can break the game
-quests will disappear out of the quest log
-NPCs t-pose and their AI gets broken often
-loading a save doesn’t bring in the same state
-resource gathering is a chore
-too many systems not integrated (ship, mercenary, and cultist hunt)
-points of interest don’t feel integrated into the locations
-quests, love interests, and dialogue choices feel like they’re from the mid-2000s
-assassination animations take too long
-desperately needed an editor and a narrower focus

BUT! There are positives. The game looks gorgeous. Cassandra is very well voice acted and animated. The RPG elements, equipment, and upgrade systems are fantastic with a great sense of progression and advancement as well as visual customization. I like that they had three branching story ideas (family, myth, and conspiracy) but they are so disparate. Only the myth storyline has a satisfactory ending, however. It’s also the easiest to achieve so I finished that about 50 hours before the other two.

Odyssey, for me, was a very disappointing follow-up to Origins. A big part of that is story (I loved Bayek and Aya’s journey and motivations) while the other is setting (I find Egypt is more interesting than Greece). I was engaged for over 150 hours. I have no interest in playing the DLC, though. I hope Ubisoft has taken the criticisms to heart and allowed the next one (Vikings? Ragnarok?) to have a more cohesive take on their weird history murder games.

Before I spit the truth and Iambaste this game for its lazy RPG design, let me save you the trouble of purchasing this game just because you want to play a regular Assassin's Creed game. If you're looking for that experience, the game neither includes assassins nor the creed. So in my review, the criticisms will be based around what AC Odyssey markets itself to be; a fully fledged RPG.

TL;DR
Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a pretty game but a generic RPG at best with lazy game designs such as main quest level restrictions and poor crafting systems that revolve around the idea of deeply encouraging the player to buy boosters via microtransactions. LET IT BE WRITTEN IN FINE PRINT THE NOTION THAT $60 SINGLE PLAYER GAMES SHOULD NEVER HAVE MICROTRANSACTIONS OF ANY KIND.

LONG VERSION
Assassin's Creed Odyssey is definitely a step-up from Origins in many aspects despite being called a 2.0 of the latter. Still, Odyssey made a bigger leap from Origins than AC Brotherhood did with AC II. The first 20 hours of the game was amazing. I was overwhelmed at first by the amount of content found in the game, especially its huge open world. However, I soon realized that almost every component in the game was mostly half-a$$ed and somehow lacking the depth it needed.

PROS
Main Storyline and Dialogue System
The main story is the only thing that kept me motivated to actually keep playing the game after 30 hours into it. It starts off strong but slows down mid-way but picks up pace once more in its third act. The characters are interesting to interact with thru the new dialogue system; the series' first. Only problem was the ending as it lacked a specific impact. 

Combat System
Combat looks clunky but it definitely feels and plays better than it looks. It's an upgrade from Origins especially when many of the combat perks add more layers to your enjoyment. Only problem I had was the exclusion of shields, considering the fact that it was a core aspect of greek combat in the peloponnesian war. The return of the Naval Combat was also refreshing as I personally loved Black flag.

CONS
RPG Elements
Let me simply get this out of my chest first; I HATE COLOR-CODED EQUIPMENT SYSTEMS AS IT MAKES FOR LAZY GAME DESIGN. My estimate is that there are about 20 unique gear designs in this game. What it does is it basically recycles and redecorates it multiple times changing its color, name, stats, perks and rarity. It does this so that it would appear as if the game has hundreds of different weapons when in reality there's only a few amount of unique individual pieces. Also, many chests in the game has loot based on RNG (lazy design). Sure, you can make looting from corpses RNG-based but you should at least have certain items in most if not all of your chests in game because that is what truly motivates players to explore every nook and cranny of your game. Now I had the same problem with Origins but I tolerated it thinking at the back of my head they would improve on this in their next title but they didn't. Moroever, in Origins, the economy system works to a certain degree but mostly it's a meh. Now in the case of AC Odyssey, the economy system easily breaks after a couple dozen hours. That's bad news for most completionists like me who wants to squeeze all the milk from this cow down to the last teat. Adding to my frustration, most locations require you to loot chests in order to complete them but for what? If I'm already capped out and my gear is all yellow (legendary), what need have I for blue (standard) or purple(epic)? What should I do with 16543 metals or 8396 wood if all my gear has been upgraded? Again, let me reiterate and emphasize the fact that the RPG system of this game was structured with a steeper grind than Origins so as to almost force you to buy those juicy booster packs.

Open World Design
Odyssey's recration of Ancient Greece is breathtaking. Like how the sunset bleeds in the distance as its rays pierce through peaked mountains or how the proverbial moonlit nocturnal sea offers tranquility as its waves hit the bow of your ship and bobs smoothly. But it's all that it is; gorgeous. Which is not what you want if what you aim for is to sell a great game, Ubisoft. This company has the same problem in almost every open world game they release. They are pleasant to the eye but when it comes down to it, it's an ocean-wide world but with the depth of a pond. What I mean by that is the only way you can interact with the environment in this game is thru climbing. Not only that but much like the copy-pasted gear in the game, most points of interests are also recycled and scattered throughout the vast map for like a hundred times. Outposts, forts, camps and caves look generically the same and the only dfference there being where it is located on the map. Not to mention the fact that the game rewards you with such tiny amounts of XP for completing locations. Why not make exploration rewarding with good loot and huge xp boosts? Again, it doesn't do that because it encourages you more in buying boosters than actually exploring this beautiful yet uninspired world. What I would suggest in future AC titles is to make exploration more dynamic and seamless like in Skyrim and Breath of the Wild wherein they never gave the player an idea where a point of interest maybe just by looking at the map. To hell with checkmark exploration wherein you have to open your map once every 5 mins just to check which next question mark location you have to complete next. It breaks immersion and it feels like doing chores. The Witcher 3 had the same problem as well (tho it's my favorite game of all time, I'll take a p!ss at it for its checkmark exploration as well).

Side Content
Here's the thing, in no way should a player be forced to do side content just to get some xp to further progress in the main story. Any game should be playable from start to finish even without touching its side content because it is optional by nature. But with this game, they made side content a requirement to catch up on levels that is unless you buy their scrumptious booster packs boo hoo. Most players may have a problem with that but personally, I don't mind doing side content first because I prefer to not rush through the main story at once. However, this malaka of a game made me hate its grinding aspect because in order to gather resources or xp, mostly I had to do these procedurally generated quests that reminded me of the boring design from the old games. It felt like chores, Malaka.

CONCLUSION
With good intentions allow me to say this; A good game will sell itself. Most of Ubisoft's games are bland which is probably why they go above and beyond in their marketing efforts to sell their game. Look at Rockstar Games, let's say even if Red Dead Redemption 2 only had one trailer to show for, people would still be flocking to that game like moths to a candle. It's that good. With Odyssey however, it tries to be a lot of things yet fails at the very core of what it needs to be; a good RPG. Which is why I liked Origins better because it accomplished what it set itself out for; rekindle the series. Now, One can argue that Odyssey is worth $60 for the sheer volume of content it has which I can agree with. It may be worth your money, but it really isn't worth your time doing a hundred percent completion on this one tho. Play it for the main story and characters alone, it's worth your while for sure. AND PLEASE, DON'T BUY INTO THE LIE THAT YOU NEED BOOSTERS TO FINISH THE GAME. NEVER GIVE SATISFACTION TO CORPORATE PIGS WHO WANT TO SQUEEZE EVERY COIN FROM YOUR POCKET ON AN ALREADY EXPENSIVE GAME.

I will keep this one short and simple. (Ok I finished, and it was not short or simple.)

I have only 7hrs in this game so far, I have a rough introduction to the story. Who I am, who my friends and enemies are. But of course that could all change quickly in this somehow incredibly immersive and all round solid game.

Seriously, I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hate Ubisoft 9/10 times... Ask any of my friends, Uplay is "Ucancer" on my desktop.

But this game... Its really not like any AC title I have ever played. And I never really enjoyed any AC titles but Liberation. This game to me feels like a less detailed, less RPG elemented Witcher 3. Which let me tell you is not a bad thing, I have grinned and gone "woah cool"... I have had tears in my eyes and been shaken by a scene. I have felt genuine confusion and anger towards someone "I love" but its just pixels and crap I realise.

I cannot believe I am reccomending a AC game, console trash usually. But this is a must have if you enjoy RPGs. I have basically no real love for Assassins Creed, but I do now.

Pros:
- Incredible World, its alive and I am convinced immersion wise. Graphics on my rig are rich are great overall.
- Fantastic Storyline, the main storyline so far and I imagine I am far from being finished. Is very much enjoyable.
- Gameplay is solid... Not the most fluent combat, and the Greeks rocky terrain can shake things up. But very much acceptabe.
- The items, outfits, voices, Greek sense of Culture is all outstanding.

Cons:
- Game is very, very CPU/GPU intense. I have a high end machine and have not had any issues, but most medium to good rigs are struggling in some areas.
- Can be daunting if you want to do "all the quests"... They flow well if you can order them right and you get a good sense of accomplishment and dialogue out of them. Sometimes it can be... "messy" and confusing though.
- Side quests so far have had no real "punch" or emotional drive like Witcher 3. The A grade is very much in the main storyline, at least 7hrs in it feels that way. No biggie... its a "side" quest for a reason.
- I do not like killing dogs... its been difficult but I have simply avoided the woofers. Not really a con... shut up this is my review.

All in all... sigh... Cannot believe it. Ubisoft has created a fantastic Game. It does not feel one bit like Assassins Creed of the past. And I for one think that is for the better. Big time.

7hrs in... I give this game a 91% and I believe it should be Game of the Year. Good luck Fallout 76, good luck COD... But this is my bet for GOTY.

I will update as I play/finish the game without spoilers.

UPDATE

22hrs in... Still great. Do it, the game is terrific. Well worth a buy.

38hrs... I stand by this.

【｡_｡】 αѕѕαѕѕιи'ѕ ¢яєє∂ σ∂уѕѕєу 【｡_｡】

After playing the early access from day 1 here are some plus and minus on this gorgeous DLC :p This game is good I must say different from other Assassin's Creed title but tied with the main story of the Assassins from the same timeline of Darius the first Assassin.

ᴘʀᴏs:

• Alexios and Kassandra are a great duo of protagonists.
• Beautifully crafted ancient Greece a big and bold setting with tons of varieties and stuffs great for people who loves exploring.
• Visually one of the best looking game of all time.
• Your choices do effect the story a lot.
• Much more improved and fluid combat system far better than Origins.
• Side quests are great and some has impact on main quests..
• The story is compelling best with the feature that requires you to investigate for quest details.
• Naval combat is incredibly exciting.
• A vast collection of animals which enhances and expands the wildlife perfectly.
• Immersive music that matches the environment.
• A lot of historical structures and places with tons stuffs to learn about ancient Greece.
• Set during the great Penepolese War which you do have to take part in.
• The same beautiful photomode from Origins.
• Tons of armors and weapons to grind or work for.
• Nice clean UI and inventory menu.

ᴄᴏɴs:

• Optimization is not good hoping for some patches for more stability.
• Slutters and minor bugs.
• Voice acting and vocal animations are poor expected better.
• Too much level grinding which is a big problem if you don't own a 10$ permanent XP booster.
• Stealth is broken you stab someone from back and guess what only 10% damage dealt because of level which is not good :3
• Dialogue choices and performances are inconsistent.
• Romantic relationship options feel forced and unnecessary.
• Core narrative is underwhelming at times.
• Not a real Assassin's Creed game more like a Greek fighting game although it's directly related with assassins.
• A rewind mode in is what the photo mode needs now although it's already very good.
• VMprotection and Denuvo.

In the end not the best game from Assassin's Creed franchise not even looks like one from the franchise tho but it's a good game if you look at it from gameplay and visual standpoint. I will suggest to wait for sales. Running High/Very High mix@40-50fps Avrg Gtx 970 but fps sometimes drops to 10 or below.
N.B. Do lemme know if I did any mistakes.

I used to be a fanboy, and you have ruined that.

Origins was what our series needed, and you decided to go back to 1 year release again.
Origins brought us a new stealth combat and a new engine, Odyssey took it and destroyed it.

You are no more an Assassin, i play on nightmare since Origins, because it is 2 easy, and it is almost impossible to finish a mission stealthy even with 120k points on Assassin. Also, the only assassin creed content is inside season pass (legacy of the first blade) there is no assassins creed lore, only the pieces of eden. Braces yourselves for the biggest grinding of your gaming history, in order to upgrade weapons you will need to kill yourselves. Won't even argue about how bad this game is. Abilities in an Assassins Creed game? Really? DLC content ADDS NO NEW AREAS.

My rig Ubisoft is: i7 4790 | 12GB RAM | GTX 1060 3GB
Some games i play on ultra at 60 FPS (1080p)
- Witcher 3
- GTA V
- MGS V Phantom Pain
- Dirt Rally
- Mad Max
- Shadow of War
- Far Cry Primal
- Skyrim SE
- Just Cause 3
- Dying Light
- Etc

Average fps on Odyssey - 30 fps (High/Medium)

Transactions
I have all assassins creed games, and i feel this will be my last one, well done Ubisoft. Oh and one more thing, well done with your micro/transactions, i loved them. I also love, how you make a set with 5 items, all of them with dif levels, so we have to upgrade them with in game materials. Most people don't like to grind for 10 hours in order to gather materials, so you sell those packs with materials, well done.

Final Thoughts
ASC Story no longer makes sense, there's no assassins, there's no templars, every character is forgetabble, story missions are all boring, ah gosh. I remember Ezio trilogy missions were so epic, so diverse, many chasses, many unforgetable places... i remember climbing SãoPedro in Vaticano, it was amazing, special... Now every mission is short and sends you to fights and more fights, is hard to tell how i feel about the combat, it takes mins to kill high level enenemies, it is annoying, once again, this is no assassins creed, from a fan that that owns all the games, more than 500 hours on the franchise.. Used to be my fav publisher, now you have become the worst money grabbers out there, trash games, every single year!
You should learn with rockstars or cd project red, they publish less, and win more fans and more money than you.
I think Ubisoft did a good job, it is a wonderful game, a fantastic rpg, it truly is, a lot of customization, tons of content, tons of quests, puzzles, tombs, bosses, forts, naval combat, but it lacks everything about assassins creed, they should have changed the name, it is one of my games of all time, but not an assassins creed game, origins was the origins of both factions, and even told us who the father of understading is, now odyssey... Ubisoft made it because they want money.

NOTE: you find a temple on a middle of nowhere, there's a chest to loot, nice! Enemy: a Wolf, a WOLF!

Ubisoft in 2008: We removed crossbow because of historical inacuracy;
Ubisoft in 2018: Pegasus, Burning Horses, Jumping from a 100 meters cliff and surviving.

Despiste being the worst assassins creed game type, they added some nice features the witcher series already had, consequences and choices on missions, which is very immersive, well done Ubisoft, you did good on that. You also choose your character gender. Another thing i loved, was face expressions, adds realism and drama, love it. Graphics and Voice Acting is also phenomenal. I have to give credit, on release Odyssey had many issues, now we can upgrade with ability points some perks, for example assassin damage, on release there was no such perks.


As a game, i give 9/10, and i dont give more because of transactions and optimization.
As an Assassins Creed, i give 5/10, it speaks of the pieces of Eden and because of Layla.
This game is extremely unrealistic, Unity and AC1 win in terms of realism, so much fantasy now.

Game is mostly good but I CANNOT recommend it until they change this ridiculous micro-transaction/Orichalcum system that they added to this game. They're trying to see what they can get away with, I don't want my PC games like mobile games, this isn't clash of clans.

From what I've seen Ubi devs decided to use things from other games. In the core It's AC:Origins and AC 4:Black Flag(for sea battles) combined with abilities like MGS:V style recruiting, Witcher 3 style dialoges and Shadow of Mordor style blink & assassination (Yes blink, you can teleport in this game with a skill in assassin tree).

So Why do I recommend this game?

Not because it's an assassin's creed game but because it's a beautiful rpg with nice dialoges, beautiful characters and fun combat. You are no longer playing an assassin. You are a sell-sword who is profiting the turmoil between Spartans and Athenians. Grand battles are super fun. You can choose your side and start butchering. The skill tree allows you to decide how you wanna play. There are 3 skill trees: Hunter(ranged), Warrior(melee) and Assassin(stealth). You can choose however you fit between them.

The choices you make have consequences for the first time in AC series. You can choose your character male/female and suit yourself however you like. Game relies heavily on looting. Once you find best pieces you might want to upgrade them.

Before I proceed to pros & cons, I'd like to say that I never had crash or seen a game breaking bug.
I can run the game around 65 fps in medium-high 1080p.
My specs are: Gtx 970, i7-4690k 16 gb ram game is downloaded on sshd.

Pros:

+ Very long and satisfying gameplay
+ Combat & Skill Tree
+ Freedom in dialoges and consequences
+ Vast open world map with the ability to use your own ship
+ Choosing your own side between two nations
+ Historical landmarks and mythological events
+ Grand Battles
+ Spartan Kick!

Cons:

- Unrealistic abilities: Blinking, Predator Shot...

As a conclusion: I'd say wait for a sale. But If you liked Origins then this game will satisfy you more thus you might want to buy now. I played and finished all AC games (exluding 2d games like AC China, India, Russia) and I can say that this game is not what I liked to see. But for a rpg-genre this game has a lot to impress you. Forget that you are playing AC, sit back, enjoy the beautiful landmarks in greece and shout this is sparta..!


EDIT: After 60+ hours of gameplay I can say that +%50 percent exp and gold boost is unneccasary. I got 50 level (max level for now) and over 400k gold and I didn't even explored or finished %50 of the map and quests. There are difficulty settings (easy, normal, hard, nightmare) for you to suit your desire. There are builds to reduce enemy sponginess and allows you to go full stealth. Here is a one way to go full stealth, you can read about it in my guide :

NO-ONE'S MADE AN OPEN-WORLD RPG WITH THIS MUCH DEPTH AND BRILLIANCE SINCE THE WITCHER 3

Ubisoft really wasn't joking around when it called the latest Assassin's Creed game an Odyssey. It's not just in the Greek tragedy-inspired story, the vast, vast map or the sheer number of hours you're going to sink into it. It's the journey. The journey from one Greek island to another, with dolphins and whales cresting the waves alongside your boat. It's about the journey across the stunning Grecian landscape, ranging from forests bearing autumnal hues, to the majestic white marble buildings nestled comfortably in the cities, and absolutely everything in between. Including an active volcano that you can swan dive into. But more importantly, it's also about the journey to discover who exactly you are in Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

And I say you because this is the first time an Assassin's Creed game has given you a choice of characters to play as - Alexios or Kassandra. Deciding which of these two assassins to play as is basically your first choice in the game beyond tweaking difficulty and whether to use the guided or brand new exploration mode that strips out your waypoints in favor of a more organic discovery trail. But it's the first choice you'll make of many. Whether you're diving into main story content or working your way through one of what feels like thousands of side quests and events, you'll constantly be deciding how your assassin will react, behave and even fall in lust.

Because of that, it's easy to fall in love with this pair of assassins. I've been playing as Kassandra, but as a GamesRadar team we've seen how the same scenes play out as Alexios or Kassandra. It seems like the dialogue doesn't vary regardless of who you pick, because the weight is all on the dialogue options you choose. Although I wouldn't dare spoil any of the game's major story points - and trust me, this game has more twists and turns than a Disney World roller coaster - every choice you make can have a consequence, which may reach further than you think in that moment

Perfects everything Origins did and enhances them in ways you never thought an Assassin's Creed game could. Odyssey has it all.

What an amazing way to diverge from the deserts of egypt than to come to the lush islands of Greece. Really just a great effort all around to bring rpg mechanics to the forefront even more in this installment as well, something I personally appreciate.
Optimization at launch wasnt great but 2 months of updates and I am now getting a pretty constant 60 fps on ultra settings with a GTX 1080.

A Witchers Creed The Wild Odyssey

This can not continue , despicable marketing practices implemented on a disastrous grind fest filled with monetization and micro transactions empty of meaningful content obscured by pay walls is something someone would say if he/she would treat this game following a linear pathway and focusing solely on the main story. Yes micro transactions are there , the store page stands glorious with plenty of options to customize your experience or cut some game time off. But why would you do all that , why treat a game with a vast open world ready to be explored in any fashion the player desires so like a hallway game??? Nothing offered in the game store is really needed if the game is played as it is meant to played, exploring locations doing side quests , uncovering all of Ancient's Greece secrets in a masterfully crafted world which was created by carefully analyzing and examining the Greek peninsula and its monuments.Historical locations are captured in all their magnitude and past glory in a really detailed and carefully crafted environment. This is the definition of AAA games and this is how AAA games should look like. I prefer to spend 50 euros and buy a game with an abundant amount of content and a decent narrative than pay 50 euros and play atrocities like Dotnods Entertainment Vampyr even if there isn't a store in their 5 easy steps how to treat insomnia simulator game. IF you don't like the store page and micro transactions DONT USE THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ STORE you don't even need it anyway if the game is played as it is meant to.
The combat is fluent providing an immense amount of customization options from stealth assassin knockouts to brute force as a warrior , to a slimy hunter shooting arrows from a far or to a combination of them all in the later levels.
A plethora of weapons from bows to staffs and daggers combined with different engravings (in this game engravings are the stats of a weapon) suitable for unique builds and some really overpowered stuff as the game progresses and your character gets to those higher levels. The amount of gear dropped is based on diablo style looting system so don't worry about finding your perfect gear , even if you are the unluckiest person on this planet (like someone who bought Shadow Of War Deluxe Edition ) you will get eventually your desired best in slot gear for any of the builds you are planing to play on.
The graphics are outstanding with the highest remark going to the water visuals and the representation of the Mediterranean coast.It is so good that i actually got sea sick while roaming the high tides, an effect similar to the nausea i experienced while playing that atrocity of a game called Shadow of Mordor. So why am i referring to shadow of mordor now? because this game also includes that so high praised and critical acclaimed nemesis system Shadow of Mordor offered and so proudly advertised , only here it is just a tiny fracture of the whole game play.
Quest's are plenty while some like the free add on called Lost tales of Grecce are remarkable some are less than exciting but that is something common in a game that has over 100 quests in its catalog , don't worry there aren't many quests requesting you to find 5 bear skins for a blacksmith who wants to craft a fancy armor. (There are 2 though and i don't have the slightest clue on why). The main story quest line is decent with a normal narrative ( You are the chosen one, evil guys with a hoodie want to kill you blah blah blah kill them all blah blah ♥♥♥♥ it i am just here to gaze that marvelous environment and kill mythic beasts to be honest) revealing almost all of Ancients Greece pop-star figures from Herodotos to a questionable version of the politician Alkibiades and the constant annoyance of Socrates guiding you throughout your adventures.Also it wouldn't be a Greek based game without the mythology behind it so fights with Medusa , the Minotaur and other ancient Greek super-villains are to be expected.
Finally the voice acting if you are Greek or familiar with the Greek language is a funny and welcoming surprise.All characters have a heavy Greek accent in their saying's for example occasionally in the drunken rage of a fierce battle shouting Fur Ariss or Viktouurii, and also the random yelling's of Greek Gibberish by the npc's was something that cracked a smile on my miserable face.
Well even great games like this have some downsides and its pretty logical nothing is perfect (except maybe Nier Automata) so ill point out some of those
While the games structure is heavily influenced by the Witcher quest design and exploration procedure, some repetitiveness is in order. When arriving for the 15th time in a fully guarded fort u may utter the words "Not again 5 treasures 4 burning supplies 3 captains ♥♥♥♥ my life i need to sleep", but it is mostly fine there are several ways to counter this by constantly changing your game style/talents and trying different approaches for each situation.
What will get on your nerves though is when u are going for the 50th time in a an undiscovered location and u read the words "Ainigmata Ostraka 0/1" . After discovering 30 or less from these little annoying stupid pieces of useless rocks you would have had enough. These little ♥♥♥♥♥ require you to solve a riddle and then find in the world map the exact location this riddle depicts. First of all the riddles are mostly vague , distract you from your game play . put on hold your exploration or the process of the quest you are trying to do and most importantly is it worth it? Of course it is not the reward is even worse than a free copy of Assassins Creed 3 remastered (oh wait you actually get one of these in the deluxe edition ehhhh). The reward is usually an engraving providing something like 2% damage increase on white bears close to the shoreline while 3 to 4 but no more than 5 trees are in present.Yeah i would replay Assassins Creed 3 Remastered DLC anytime than bothering on uncovering those little ♥♥♥♥ rocks again.
God ♥♥♥♥ those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rocks seriously this could be a ten out of ten

9/10 Would want a sequel on the quest line called A Really Bad day or a DLC about the origins of the "The Eagle Bearer" and his mighty companion Cikaros.

This really is an excellent game, but having an ingame microtransaction store with exclusive gear (not skins, actual gear) in a single player game is inexcusable.

If it weren't for the store I'd say it's a 9/10

Easily the best AC I've played, but that being said; I will say that the only other AC I enjoyed before this one, was Black Flag. I was never able to really get on board with the old formula.

To keep this short, I feel that Ubi did a great job implementing RPG-like elements to their game. It's no Witcher in terms of depth and variation but they did a good job emulating that open world formula. 140 hours for me to explore the entire map, with 80% or so of the locations visited and every meaningful quest completed.

Story is so-so, and I wish they'd drop the Abstergo/real-world crap already but I can see where they're trying to go with it. Overall it was good enough to keep my attention all the way through the main game, and the first DLC (Legacy).

Once I got to Atlantis, I really felt like I was forcing myself to finish the game. Diminishing returns is a serious issue. The DLC's don't really add anything "new" to the game, just more of the same. If you're into that, you'll enjoy it.

Overall this is an easy recommend for anyone looking for a well-fleshed out open world, with "choice & consequence" story-telling and RPG-lite elements. Long-time AC fans will either love it or hate it due to the deviation from the old formula.

8/10

At the moment of this review I have played for 150 hours. Just finishing the first Atlantis DLC and starting the second.
Do I think this game is good and can I recommend it? YES, period.
A few words about this game? You will love it. Or hate it. It depends on whether you expect it to be the same as the old ACs.

Very good, but the optimization could be better, you need a good pc to run it smoothly and NVIDIA card is better for this game, AMD has worse results here.
I use a reshade filter adding some sharp but they are very good in general.
And the photo mode has been improved from Origins, which I personally like a lot.

Music:
Really good, greece welcomes you!! You won't get bored with the music but after many hours it's always the same, even the bards sing the same song all over Greece and even in Atlantis. More songs would be nice but you can always run Spotify.

Story:
The main story is fine, something basic in its initial planning but it is gaining strength as you go through it and you realize that, deep down, it is not as basic as it seems. Personally I liked it a lot.

Gameplay:
The combat feels good. Improvement with respect to AC-Origins. Personally I have been playing in nightmare mode, where a mistake is fatal and I recommend it once you have decent equipment and skills.

I recommend this youtube channel where you can find a build that fits your style of play

Negative point:
The optimization could be better
The main story gives you multiple possibilities and you can end it the way you want, good, evil or a mix, BUT not in the DLCs, whatever you choose, you will arrive eventually to the same ending, because that history is written and you have to arrive to the end, where SPOILER HERE

Odyssey in allot of ways is several steps ahead of Origins, but somehow took more steps backwards.

The plot and story are tenfold better than Origins, even if they're strikingly similar - a family focused story and you oppose a mysterious organisation that are trying to kill you and you're family.

the ship gameplay is super lackluster and downright infuriating, despite Black Flag coming out 5 years ago Ubisoft has not been capable of getting it right since (expect the super short Rouge which is just a Black Flag expansion). Unlike Black Flag where your ship progressed powerfully alongside your character in this game its secondary, so you have no incentive to put any upgrades into it. And you would be an idiot to do so, every level you gain is way too significant a jump in damage and health and if you have no materials to upgrade your legendary weapons as you level you'll be at a massive disadvantage.

Because you put no active effort into your ship and a single level means a significant jump in difficutly it becomes unfair very, very quickly. You're ship will be ganked by groups of 3 or more pirates at every turn of the ocean and you will die very fast.

But all in all the ship gameplay is a very miniscule part of Odyssey and isn't what annoys me the most. The actual story grinds to a total halt once you reach level 13 for a short time. Then it REALLY grinds to a halt in the early 20's.

Their aren't enough story missions to get you to a high enough level to continue the story, once you finish a mission you'll find yourself grinding 3-4 levels to reach the new zone or start the next mission. It's the most insane thing I've ever witnessed in an Assassins Creed game before in its history.

And that's the catch - you literally have to pay money to get boosters to progress the story at a reasonable rate. My god. It can easily cost $20 to finish the story as it is told, otherwise head to grind town.

Going into this for an Assassin's Creed experience? Stop.

As a previous long time fan of the series, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is something altogether unfamiliar from the originals. I'll be honest when I say the setting for the game intrigued me, and for the most part the main story is somewhat interesting. At the start, at least. They start off really strong, but it just winds down quickly after you're able to leave the starting island.

I would've been able to give this game a decent review, had it not been for... the time savers.

The most stupidest thing to ever exist in a singleplayer game, period. You bought our game? Cool, give us an extra twenty, and you can skip some of our mediocre sidequests. Oh, that cool horse you can get? Ten dollars on our cash shop. Want to just BUY resources instead of working towards it and it feeling rewarding like in our previous games? Sure, a few extra dollars please!

The fact that there is a cash shop button in a singleplayer game is absolutely ridiculous.

As for the game itself, you slowly start to realize why it's so easy to access the cash shop. Combat is generic, with a few special abilities thrown in to keep it mildly interesting. A lot of enemies are just simply too tanky, which is a large gripe I have with this new generation of Assassin's Creed. I don't want to level up my character so I can actually kill them, I want to upgrade them with cool gadgets and abilities so I can get the job done better.

The game is spectacularly beautiful in every frame, the art and visuals team did amazing. The story is decent, but the sidquests you're forced to do to level if you don't want to buy any time savers will kill your drive to finish the main story. The combat will bore you quickly.

I don't recommend this game to anyone. If you want to play an RPG like this, you may as well play World of Warcraft.

The great Odyssey we joined
So awesome, we'd enjoyed
We didn't follow the creed
Who the f*ck does it need
Doing under the breeze Shaka Laka
Ahoy, envy and watch us, Malaka!

One of my favorite games! Like both, Odyssey and Origins, but Odyssey is a much better version of Origins for me! One of those games that I went to full completion (map and quests).

I like Ancient Greece, and its Mythology a lot! And here you can meet it in the base game and even more in the second DLC about Atlantis. There many famous historical persons from those times and not only from Ancient Greece. I will not spoil anything, so you could see it yourself.

I like the combat and skills - action-action plus you have 4 active skills for a melee weapon and 4 active skills for a bow. There are plenty of melee weapons you can choose from. And the items (armor, weapons) have different visuals and stats + you can find sets of armor that will give even more benefits. I like that Odyssey has a loot system that you can find and get from the enemies. All items are upgradeable. Also, there is a transmog system - you can put an item visual on any other of the same category. The skills tree has many interesting features to offer, both active and passive, and you can upgrade them. You can upgrade your ship with materials that easily obtainable in the open world or as rewards. Didn't have any problems with it or with leveling - I was always several levels above the recommended and required level of the main quest. You have a mount here, and you can obtain different skins for it as well.

There are plenty of quests. I almost didn't do quests from the boards - they are randomly generated just to have XP and currencies. But I did all the quests with the story. And they can be hilarious, dramatic, exciting, and interesting. The same feeling I have about the main quest.

The game feels repetitive at some point. But you will not find the big forts or locations the same. Even small fortifications are at least slightly different. I like the world and exploring it, and this climate (though islands could differ drastically) is more to my taste than the one in the Origin. The world is beautiful and big, and you can visit some iconic places!

I like the bounty system when hunters going for your head, and you can kill them or make them one of your lieutenants on the ship. Also, you can progress at this bounty system as well and eventually become number one.

I completed the game long ago and maybe forgot something to say, but all in all - the game is cool and will give many hours to play even without a full completionist run. Though, as I say, it will feel repetitive at some point, so take it into consideration before trying the game.

A good game? Hell yes. One of the best. This game is massive.
A good ASSASSIN'S CREED game? Well, still yes. Tbh this game is like an upgraded version of Origins. The grind might be too much for some people, for me it is just fine. I don't have to purchase any xp boost or something like that to enjoy the game. U don't have a hidden blade, but the spear of Leonidas functions in the same way (and it looks very sexy everytime u upgrade it). The story doesn't have anything about the creed vs the templar but aside from that, it is really good. Gameplay wise, much better than Origins. Now instead of parrying with your shield and doging everytime, now u have abilities to play with. They have i-frames too so u can abuse them in some tricky situation. 1 hit assassination kill is doable if u have the right skills, gears and some luck. Heck, I even 1 hit kill a mercenary 3 levels above me due to lucky crit. Graphics wise, this game is beautiful, just like Origins.
Now, about the story. Many people say this is not an Assassin's creed game because u are not an assassin. U are a mercenary. In fact, the main story doesn't have anything related to the Brotherhood. But it does focus on the Cult of Kosmos, one of the predecessors of the Templar Order. U aren't an assassin but technically, the game still plays out the same as other assassin's creed game. U fight against the cult for some reason (this time for your family and avenge the cult, kinda like Unity). And if u play the Legacy of the first blade dlc, u will know that your character is also the ancestor of Aya, an assasin in Origins.
The core gameplay mechanic is still here and they just expand it. U can play like an assassin just like any other games, or rambo style with warrior or kill enemies from a distance with hunter. They change the gameplay that now u can't 1 hit assassinate SOME type of enemies normally because that is to easy. Now, u will need to think more. To 1 hit kill heavier enemies u will need to spend 1 bar of your abilities with specific skills u learn. Normal mobs that u can 1 hit kill normally will recharge u with 1 bar (or higher, depends on your build). Elite enemies may not die even when u use your ablilites, but doing so still take them a large amount of hp and give u a big advantage in combat. Pls remember that this is a rpg game. Don't expect any of this if u are facing enemies that are much higher levels than u (unless u are well-geared and have a specific build).
Overall, a great and massive game. Highly recommend to get this game on sale so u can get the dlcs too.

This is the new type of Assassin's Creed game made by UBISOFT.. Worth every penny you spent on it.. You can have minimum 100 hours of Greek tour with awesome Spartan fights... Enjoyed every bit of it.. Will get season pass if this gets a price cut soon ..

The game is beautiful, yes, but the quests....their are bad and not interesting (except main quest and Atlantis). Gameplay is ineteresting but after Kefalinia its became annoying.
Not the best AC but still better than Syndicate and not better than Origins.

I hope that in 2020 AC will shoot as well as in 2017.

Beautiful graphics and world to traverse around in with interesting story but the game is seriously riddled with "Time wasters". The fighting gameplay honestly felt like a downgrade to me as compared to the old AC titles.

I got 30+ hours clocked into this game and I stopped because I don't have much time to game these days and guess what? Most of the time spent was doing the repetitive missions to level up.

They designed this game to make you waste time leveling up so as to strong arm you to buy the x2 exp pack etc before you can progress-
So as much as I want to finish this game? I decided not to because I am not going to spend more time grinding away.
I might some time in the future I guess but as of writing this review, it's a no.

I miss the style of the old AC games where you just progressed the story with missions and optional side quests.

This is the last AC Game I buy unless they revert it back to no microtransaction and leveling but lets face it, that's not gonna happen lol so I'm not buying anymore AC games.

I will recommend buying the older AC titles (The games made way before the time wasting grind fest system started) and not recommend buying this game BUT if you do buy this game, please for the love of holy mother Mary-

**DO NOT MAKE ANY IN-GAME PURCHASES**

Microtransaction / Loot box system need to die.

If you can get over the fact that this isn't the Assassins Creed of last generation, you're sure to find a great game in there. The in-game store is loaded with extras, but none of that crap is actually required to enjoy the game at it's core.

If you liked Origins, this is basically that, but better and more refined.

I truly enjoyed every bit of this game and played it even after finishing the main story. Fun side quests with some good humor in them aswell.

Great fighting system, great Naval Warfare and Amazing Exploration style.

Also love the addition of RPG effects introduced since Origin they give the AC games alot more depth!

I had no expectations for this game, I'm not even a fan of the series.... But man.... this game is impressive! The more you play, the more you want to play it. The map is embarassing, really immense, full of quests and charismatic Npc's and walking through the old Greece gives you a lovely feeling due to an amazing setting, breathtaking landscapes and the astounding graphics. I personally liked the fact that the choices you make during your adventure, even the smallest ones, will have a consequence in the game, immediately or not, and this factor will make every game unique. Enjoy your Odyssey my friend, this is a solid 10/10.

A huge stepdown from AC Origins. They crammed this big, beautiful world full of boring, repetitive quests that are designed to waste what little time you have on God's green earth. Everything about this game feels like a chore: combat, inventory management, quest design, exploration, dialogue choices. Alexios is a kind hearted merc with a mouth one quest, an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the next, cares about Sparta one quest, has no problem killing Spartans the next. It's all quantity over quality, games-as-a-service design, please everyone while pleasing no one. There are interesting bits of gameplay and genuinely interesting quests here and there, but they are very few and far between. Get it on sale, or better yet just get Origins and forget this game exists, don't let the allure of Ancient Greece draw you in like the Siren's songs drew in sailors to their doom.

I haven’t played an AC game since AC2 over 10 years ago… and frankly this game feels very similar to that.

Reading other reviews, this game is apparently “not like an AC game” so I don’t know what they did to the franchise between AC2 and Odyssey but the mechanics haven’t really changed. Feels like an AC game to me, mashed with the Witcher 3.

Realistically, the gameplay is a lot like AC2, but I expected it to be. I wanted the game for its visual beauty and nostalgic gameplay and that is honestly what I got; so I cannot personally fault the game! Loving it at the moment!

I really do NOT like that it has to play through Ubisoft Connect. Took me 45 minutes to actually log in when it finally decided there was no server error any more. I was so close to trying to steam refund. I would rather play this game offline directly through steam and forego ANY online experience if it meant I didn’t have to play through the garbage Ubisoft Connect thing. Unfortunately I can’t.

I have a few choice words for this game. I have a guilty pleasure like relationship with this franchise, and coming from someone enjoyed Origins but recognized it's flaws, this game somehow manages to be a step down from even that. First off, you can forget about any kind of immersion in this game. You can fling enemies around like ragdolls, and acquire perk points that give you god like abilities (no fall damage) and while it can be fun to play around with for a few minutes, it just further adds to the plastic nature of the world. Cities, cliffs, walls, are all just belittled down to mere speed bumps in the way of your destination. In addition, I don't mind sacrificing some realism for the coolness factor, but come on, some of these kill animations are straight out of anime, and the way ships behave in naval warfare is LAUGHABLE. You could be on shore, watching two ships duke it out, and try not to laugh as they dance around each other with the maneuverability of speed boats and then some. Sideways? Backwards? Doesn't matter. Everything's fair game.

Let's talk about the graphics. Never before have I seen a game look so good while yet still somehow unpleasant to look at. Everything within ten feet in front of you is gorgeous, but beyond that, even at ultra view distance, things become a blurry mess that you can tell was designed not to be noticed as easily on lower resolutions. Pop in is a major issue as well as stuttering in complicated areas like dense cities. The water simulation in this game is among the best I've seen, but everything else is a noticable step down from origins. (The cloud simulation is also quite impressive)

The side quests in this are pretty bland and the dialogue is mostly cringe. I hear people say the Greek accent is not very authentic in this game and while I can't verify that, I will say it does get irritating to listen to constantly. The main quest has its moments but it too is fairly bland. This whole game is just BLAND. The Egyptian tombs in origins were kind of boring but at least were interesting and were modeled and inspired after their real life counter parts, but the tombs and dungeons here are just copy paste, brain dead puzzle, piles of garbage. 90% of the location is EMPTY. You encounter maybe a couple snakes, and a couple pots to loot. What's the point of these locations? If the rest of the game is not realistic than just throw some enemies down there or something.

Lastly, this game moves at a breakneck pace. Even without the so called "time savers" you, your horse, your ship, all move at the speed of light making one of the largest game worlds to date seem quite small. You're literally showered with new gear causing you to open the inventory incessantly. This whole game was designed for impatient gamers. You get so much new gear that they start recycling low level gear with new stats cause they don't have enough models. So that ugly looking helmet you wore at level 3 and is back and better than ever to replace your badass helmet of the ancient kings, nice...

There's not nothing to this game but there's a lotta bull crap to get through before you have a few moments of fun. I just don't recommend.

No Assassin's?
Spoiler ahead.

Originally posted by Paul Tassi:
"Assassin’s Creed Origins was all about the birth of the Assassin order, as the title suggests. Usually when we think about Egypt, we think about ancient Egypt, thousands of years ago when the pyramids were being built, but that's not when ACO took place. Bayek’s Egyptian story starts in 49 BCE, and ends with his wife, Aya, killing Caesar, in 44 BCE.

I’m no history buff, but even I know that the Peloponnesian War, the great conflict between Athens and Sparta which is the basis for Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, took place way, way before that. It lasted almost 30 years and ran from 431 to 404 BCE. That is uh, several hundred years before Bayek and Aya found the Assassin Order, which makes it pretty clear why there are no traces of Assassins at all in Odyssey. They literally do not exist yet.

So why is this an Assassin’s Creed game?

While this part is still a theory, we are almost certainly witnessing the birth of something else. The birth of the Templar.

While the Assassins are not formed until the end of Origins, there is already an organized villain group, called “The Order,” which is what Bayek is trying to hunt down and exterminate, and what the Assassins were formed to guard against.

It stands to reason that the reason we are heading all the way back to 400 BCE is that we’re about to discover the origins of the Order, the Templar, whatever you want to call them. For all I know, we may even be playing as the founding member, as either Alexios or Kassandra. An alternate theory is that we could be playing as Aya's ancestor, meaning we're still on the side of the light, but I very much doubt that.

While Odyssey has been relatively light on story details so far, it makes sense for reasons other than the timeline. We are already seeing our hero wield a Piece of Eden in the form of the spear, something so powerful it will likely end up corrupting anyone that uses it long enough. And it’s the goal of the Templar to acquire more of these and use them to rule the world with rigid order.

And you know who else likes rigid order? The Spartans, which would make Sparta a prime candidate to be the birthplace of a secret order of powerful warriors who want to control everything.

But ultimately, it is the timeline that does it. Since this is literally hundreds of years before the Assassins are founded, this game really cannot be about anything but the Templar, who were around first, and already finding Pieces of Eden to dominate their enemies."

One of the best Assassins Creeds.
Gameplay to dollar value is high, Im over 100 Hours in and I've barely played the story.
Several Endings and dialogue trees upping replay value even more.
The map is MASSIVE. Its almost to big.
On nightmare mode its almost dark souls levels of difficulty.
Mechanics are solid.
Several play style options which all feel viable.

My only real con is the end game. The arena was extremely easy compared to Orgins and this one needed less cyclops monsters and more ridiculously giant mythical monsters like the chimeras and stuff. There is some stuff but just feels like a missed opportunity with the whole Odyssey concept.

I LOVE this game so much!!!!
It's so amazing being able to go back in time and interact with Sokrates, Plato, Pythagoris and a whole slew of other ancient philosophers. There are also Legendary animals to collect and you can come face to face with some of the most well-known mythological beasts, such as the Minotaur and Medusa!!
The country-side is beautifully detailed and GORGEOUS!! So much awesome flora and fauna to behold.
You will additionally be able to take command of your very own boat, the Adrestia, and sail the seas and fight other vessels.
There are so many different armor pieces and weapons to collect and upgrade, too! :D

I also got the DLC: Legacy of the First Blade and The Fate of Atlantis (Ultimate Edition was on sale :).
I LOVE the Atlantis DLC because you get to see Elysium, the Underworld and (duh,ha ha) Atlantis!

There is also a Discovery Tour which takes you through the map in Odyssey and you can take tours and learn about Philosophy, Architecture, Daily Life, War, and Mythology.

I completed EVERYTHING 100% because the game is so GOOD! LOL

At 104.2 hrs as measured by Steam, I have completed the main story line. My final in-game tally is just shy of 89hrs. This is by far the most hours I have ever spent in an AC game, having skipped only AC: Unity and AC: Origins. And I loved most of these hours.

The game is gorgeous, absolutely stunning. The setting is great and there is solid atmosphere building. As AC:Syndicate was the last AC I played, the step to massive open-world RPG was something I had to get used to, but honestly it was refreshing.

I can go on and on about the things that I loved, but I would rather state a few things that made the experience a bit less great.
The game is massive, a little bit too much so. At times it was very overwhelming to travel the world and see so many things to do. There is simply too much to do. Where do I start? What do I prioritize? And I say this having played the ever living crap out of Skyrim. I blasted through the first 50-60hrs of playing, but after that I had to slow down as I felt overwhelmed and a lot of the side quests are too similar.
The mercenary system sucks. The idea is nice, the execution terrible. It makes invading forts silently stupidly hard, especially during periods where you have a forced bounty. The mercenaries smell you the moment you are not hidden and they come zooming over like the Flash, even though no guard has seen you. This should be fixed if implemented in future games (idk if this exists in Valhalla).
There is a lot of dialogue, and I could have easily added an hour to my total playtime if I had not started skipping through it. It got boring and uninteresting to me.
Finally, the idea of choices is cool, but it should be possible to select an option where choices do not matter for your story. I just want to play the story and not have to have a guide in the overlay to ensure I get the ending I want.

All in all, though, these are my only gripes in 88hours of playing, which is super solid. I would recommend this game to rpg-lovers that wish to play in an Ancient Greek setting. The classic AC fan maybe less so, as the game is very different from games like AC2, 3, and Syndicate. Have fun!

This game is simply fantastic! Huge map, countless quests, extreme assortment of items... Beautiful scenery and a great Ancient Greek feeling. Don't look for historical accuracy, heck even the map of Greece is wrong at parts, but this is not a history or geography lesson; it's a game. I love the combat and general controls, I get immersed for hours and hours. Currently at 85% main progression, level 99 plus, at normal difficulty (for casual gameplay), I would go for hard, I am enjoying it so much I don't want it to end. I read reviews saying it's too damn hard, that bosses are insanely tough and that people keep dying. Well, maybe because I like spending some time in the menu, checking my item's stats and preparing for what lies ahead, or maybe because I am simply good at killing my enemies... I actually feel too overpowered at times. I've killed two of the mythical creatures on my first try and I've died like five times in more than fifty conquest battles, only due to a lack of focus. I actually like it; because constantly winning would make the game boring. Still, I feel too OP! My assassin has the ability to one shots any mercenary with the rush assassination so I always play with bounties on my head, to keep the free loot coming at me lol. To all, or any, new players out there, make a couple of loadouts, play a mixed style (hunter, warrior and assassin they are all important) and make sure to select the appropriate one depending on your challenge at hand. If you need money or materials for crafting, the easiest way is to run around the wall's of Athens, killing the guards and looting each tower's weapon or arrow racks. Or, you could either clear the biggest forts in the game.

Thanks Ubisoft! Can't wait to start the DLCs but also can't push myself to finish the main story. Is that called schizophrenia? lol...

(EN)
+Immersive and highly detailed recreation of ancient Greece with many historical characters
+Very big open world with many cities, towns and villages
+Exciting story with finding clues about enemies
+Side quests are more interesting and memorable than in previous game
+Three story arcs
+High replay value because of two characters you can choose from, dialogue choices with actual consequences and multiple endings
+You can fight with mythological creatures
+Mercenary system and challenging naval battles
+Enormous amount of various weapons and armor, you can also customise them by adding perks

-Relatively small amount of side quests and you can't check ones that you completed
-Copy-pasted places like caves, military camps, tombs, for example when you enter newly discovered cave, you have feeling that you have visited that place many times
-You can buy some weapons and other stuff from store, but I think that microtransactions shouldn't be in 100 € game

It's one of the best entries of AC series for me, if not the best. I definitely recommend it. 9/10

(SK)
+Pohlcujúci a prepracovaný svet starovekého Grécka s množstvom historických postáv
+Obrovský otvorený svet s množstvom rôznych menších či väčších miest
+Napínavý príbeh s hľadaním indícií o nepriateľoch
+Vedľajšie úlohy sú viac zaujímavé a zapamätateľné ako tie v predošlej hre
+Tri príbehové oblúky
+Po dohratí môžete ísť hrať znovu za druhú postavu, môžete si v rozhovoroch vybrať iné odpovede, ktoré povedú k iným dôsledkom a iným koncom
+Bitky s mytologickými tvormi
+Systém žoldnierov a námorné bitky predstavujúce výzvu
+Obrovský počet rôznych zbraní a brnení, ktoré si tiež môžete prispôsobovať pridávaním perkov

-Relatívne malý počet vedľajších úloh a nemôžete si pozrieť tie, ktoré ste splnili
-Miesta ako sú napr. jaskyne, tábory, hrobky sú okopírované, napr. pri každej jaskyni máte pocit, že ste tam už boli
-Podľa môjho názoru je dávať mikrotransakcie do 100 € hry nevhodné (môžete si kúpiť zbrane, skiny a pod.)

Jeden z najlepších dielov série AC, ak nie najlepší. Rozhodne odporúčam. 9/10

I had only played Assassin's Creed 1 & 2, and while I enjoyed them well enough, I was not expecting a lot from Odyssey. But boy was I pleasantly surprised! This is a great game, though not perfect.

Graphics
Let's get the obvious out of the way first: this game is gorgeous. It's one of the few games where I would stop frequently while on my way to a quest and just look around at the landscape because of how beautiful and impressive the graphics are. The location is ancient Greece, and the graphics of the game really help to sell it.

Immersion
This is in my opinion by far the best part of the game. The dev team has clearly done an outstanding job of recreating Ancient Greece at the time of the Peloponnesian Wars. Almost everything looks believable and realistic, from the buildings to the clothes on the NPCs. I really felt like I am an actual mercenary in ancient Greece. Obviously this is a video game and there are a few things that are a-historical, but really it didn't diminish the experience for me.
For people who are interested in this setting and want to learn more, there's even a Discovery mode, where you can just go on Tours of the famous sights and experience them in the game.
Last point on this, the map is huge, and there are a lot of things to be done.

Gameplay
The gameplay is good, but I wouldn't say I was blown away by it. They introduced elements of RPG but it stays simple. You have a few abilities you can use in combat or out of conflict, but it's mostly about dodging/parrying and counter-attacking. There's also the possibility of taking a more "stealthy" approach, which I found quite enjoyable. The fights are all in all very enjoyable and you feel quite badass when infiltrating a fort, assassinating a target, and then fighting your way out.
I should also mention the naval warfare, in which you fight other ships and cleave/board them. I must say it gets really awesome when you and your crew jump on the other ship and engage in a fight to the death.

Main Plot
I'm not going to spoil anything here, but suffice to say that the plot is good, and there are some great moments, although I found it sadly lost steam towards the end. The game lets you choose between Alexios and Kassandra for the main character of the story. I chose Kassandra, and I have to say her voice acting is very good, and the game does an amazing job at showing her emotions on her face, which really helped selling the story to me.
As with other RPGs, you have decisions to make in this story, and your choices will have consequences (sometimes obvious, sometimes not so). There are also a number of interesting/funny/endearing characters that you will meet as part of this Odyssey.

Side Quests
The quality of the side quests varies a little, but for the majority it is really good. They can be funny, dramatic, or even just informative. With such a huge map, this is really important. There are too many games out there with huge open-worlds filled with uninteresting fetch quests. This is not the case here, although I could have done with a few quests less.

Soundtrack
The music is good, and I like the song of the main menu in particular.

tl;dr: It's a great game, and a must-play for anybody who's got an interest in Ancient Greece.

I have played every assassins creed game there is, and this one has been by far my favorite. Great location, story telling, characters and attempted choice, all add the the enjoyment of the game. For the fist time being able to choose dialogue and sexual preference was something new and much needed in the franchise. With tons to do and see, this game really is worth every minute of play!

Gotta be honest. I totally recommend the game, when it comes to story or gameplay, since it is insanely fun. But at the same time, i can't really recommend this game, because it has a store, where you can buy yourself the ingame currency, XP-Booster and cosmetics. In a single player game.

I've been having tons of fun playing this so far. Glad I get to have a choice be a female character finally. Super happy they added harder options for exploration. I love disabling my UI for exploration, though the settings reset every time I relaunch.. My only other complaint is the pet taming system - Bandits and other mercenaries can have dogs, so why can't I? :'(

I was going to review this game once I finish it but 100+ hours in (120 on steam) I am still not halfway done. So here's a mid-game review.

This game can be summed up as a decent RPG with essence of AC series. The main story is okay but the real reason to play the game would be the gameplay. Side quest are mix bag of some being quite funny and others just repetitive.

What I really love-
Kassandra.
Beautiful Graphics- The game is absolutely gorgeous, I like to take photos in game and this game has one of the best photo modes. I am glad that I can run this game smoothly on my mid-spec laptop.
Exploring Ancient Greece- As far as exploration goes I would rank this below Origins or Black Flag but that doesn't mean it's bad. Cities are distinctive enough, often discovering question marks is fun. There's a cool feature to just tour the historic locations which I haven't tried yet.
Characters- This may not be an popular opinion but I really love how quirky some characters are. I don't think I liked any side characters since AC2. Also, I loved the cinematic cut scenes with character entries.
So far there have been only couple or more but some side quests are funny as hell. ('Family Values', 'A Town in need, indeed')
After a certain point, there's just no fall damage!
Mercenaries really bring up the challenge, often because they will show up when you are amidst a quest.
weapon/skills/engravement system

Neutral things-
Parkour- Since I grew up playing AC series, any game without parkour felt limiting to me. Being able to climb any wall just adds another *dimension*. That said compared to older AC games I found Parkour to be weird, earlier walls used to have distinctive gaps you can climb on but here you can scale even a plain wall. Scaling up sometimes feels a little rough especially while running away from arrows.
Combat- I have been playing it on nightmare mode and I like how it forces me play it more stealthily. The combat (aside from having proper weapons) relies on timing to dodge/parry attacks, making it rewarding as you use abilities which drains stamina. It's at good balance point where I can confidently take on a same level mercenary/legendary enemies but have have to worry if one more shows up.
That said I hate that enemies can use poison/fire attacks. Sometimes I might be winning a fight but all the enemies decide to attack simultaneously, ending it in one stroke.
The big map and side quests.
Inclusion of cultists tree which unlocks legendary whenever you complete a branch.
Naval warfare- Good but not as good as Black Flag.

Now all the minor complaints-
Reusing AC2 track for nostalgia points? Be original! At least Origins had it's own track.
Sequencing can be an issue- I just love exploring, sometimes I may decide to get rid of a cultist branch or decide to clear up a region BUT then I get restricted because I haven't progressed in the story enough.
Difficulty- Nightmare difficulty should be nearly unplayable, it is not, it should be really just called 'Hard'. I expected difficulty in other things like stealth instead of just amount of damage I deal.
Dumb AI enemies. Even if you kill in front of them and then break the line of sight, after a while they will just forget about it. Detection is limited on their side as well.
Why can't we fight legendary animals again? I fought those **** boars with all I had and now want to show them who is the boss with my legendary gear BUT no they don't respawn.
Sometimes dialogues are not spoken, even subtitles disappear. Gladly it's not too often but can break the flow of the game. Otherwise bugs are rare and funny.

All said I would totally recommend the game if you like AC series or want to play an rpg which is really easy to get into.
There may be bit of grind but you won't realize it if you are like me who who tries to complete all the regions/side quests.
9/10. Can't wait to spend another 100+ hours.
-Posted on 13th November 2020


Update: Another 100 hours later (240 on steam)-
++Building new sets has been lot of fun. It's finally paying off as by experimenting I finally got some good balanced builds (Agamemnon for hunter/warrior and Athena/Pilgrim for assassin).
One hit assassinations are just so satisfying!

Also, turns out there's a new game plus mode where I can play as Alexios without losing any of the gear or abilities I have acquired. really looking forward to it.
-Posted on 25th December 2020

Update: 125 hours later (375 on steam)-
Finally completed the game with 100% everything.
++Atlantis DLC is a must play, especially for veteran AC players. It introduces more variation in combat along with detailed Isu story.

By the end I had built perfect assassin set using epic gears, along with pretty good warrior and hunter sets. Building gear sets is really the rest of the game and I still have things to try but must take a break from this 3 month odyssey.

Final Rating-
Story - 7/10
-Legacy DLC- 7/10
-Atlantis DLC- 9/10
Gameplay- 10/10
Graphics- 10/10

If you have patience and 300 hours to spend, a must try!

As a Classics major, I feel confident enough to say that Assassin's creed Odyssey is one of the most beautifully rendered and faithfully created depictions of the Ancient Greek world in a video game to date. Anyone interested in classical history/mythology will find this game enjoyable in some way, whether interacting with NPCs based on historical figures around the time of the Peloponnesian War, or completing one of the various quests based on Ancient Greek Myths. Interacting and completing quests with Socrates, Demosthenes, Perikles, Kleon, and even Alcibiades bring the accounts of Herodotus and Thucydides to life in true form, and while the historical accuracy is not perfect, it is more that enough to sate the appetite.
However, this Classical fan-service really shines when it makes you forget about the overarching Assassin's Creed story. I have never played an Assassin's Creed game before this one (as the setting was what piqued my interest), but so far I am not a fan of the Isu plot-line, nor do I find the cultist quest-line enjoyable. When placed in the context of Ancient Greece, these plot-points seem confusing, intrusive, and just plain goofy. My opinion on this aspect of the game probably would be different if I was a lifelong fan of the series, but as a person who was mainly interested in the setting and the history on which the game is based, it feels like one of the most unwelcome aspects of the experience.
Shortly on the gameplay, exploration boils down to finding camps/temples/caves filled with soldiers, looting them, killing captains, and escaping. Quests are often rewarding and interesting with exceptions, and the cities in which quests can be found are visually vibrant, especially Athens which is bigger than some entire provinces. Overall, I am enjoying this game and would recommend it to any person with a Classical bone in their body.

Even though the performance isn't as good as for Origin, it's the last game of this franchise (after AC, ACII, Brotherhood and Origins), which I completed.

And I had a blast.

Even though it doesn't use the actual Assassins Creed formula, it's still a funny game.
I recommend to play Kassandra as she has far more bite when it comes to the voice acting.

I write this review as a player who never play any AC games and true RPG games before!!!

At first, this game is so addictive, I have to admit. I've also loose myself into so damn beautiful Ancient Greece as Kassandra. The movement, combat mechanism are top notch, among the best you can find in any RPGs. Plus, simple, useful, easy-2-understand crafting system. Story, not good but not terrible either. Enough to remind yourself what are you doing after hours doing whatever you want, and want to get back to it. All of them combine easily got me fall in love with this game.

But, the more time I spend play it, the more I realize things people always talk about Ubisoft's game is true, sadly. It may have Big-Frickin-Map, but it just empty. Only reason you could spend time to travel around is to witness the beautiful of landscape. The objective, quest inside it are boring and repetitive AF. As soon as you reach Megaris, you'll how the rest of the world is. You may say that side-quest is optional, you don't have to do it if you don't like. True, but also false at the same time. This game will require you to grinding A LOT even if you only doing main quest. It's may be fun at first, but as the time come, I feel like I'm being a slave to this game. Didn't even bother to finish campaign cause I'm being tired of doing the same things all over, and over, and over again. It's not the way I want, I want to be a "player", not a "farmer". The game is drowning inside it own

Now I'm being enlighten. I doubt Ubi gonna get money from me again cause "if you wanna know how their game going to be, just play one of them then you'll know the rest". Same "successful formula", but in difference skin, difference name. It just my opinion, you may agree or disagree, I get it. But I do not recommend this game.

Gorgeous game, with absolutely PLENTY to do, but it just feels like none of these things matter and Its hard to keep track of what I'm doing and even why. The RPG mechanics are cool but the damage sponge enemies drive me inside, and as someone who loved the original AC trilogy, it's a bummer to see how detached this is from it all.

I've taken multiple 2 - 3 month breaks when playing to just try and get through it, and I'm currently in the middle of my next break, we'll see if I ever pick it up again or actually finish this game.

I am no Assassin's Creed puritan but Assassin's Creed Odyssey is not really an Assassin's Creed game, somehow less than Origins was. Now I don't mind that at all and didn't affect my view of the game just thought it worth mentioning.

Pros:
-Large and beautiful open world
-Free DLC quests
-Fun world mini-bosses (animals and mythical creatures)
-More Origins style arena battles (although Origins did it better)
-Naval combat makes a return
-Bounty and mercenary mechanics

Cons:
-The story felt uninspired and rather tiresome (so did the characters for the most part)
-The open-world doesn't feel varied leaving little to distinguish areas from one another
-Pointless dialogue options
-Choices feel like they have no consequence
-Not an RPG
-Skill trees feel dull
-Side content (both quests and locations) felt very repetitive
-The writing is okay but it's not great

By far, the best AC experience I've ever had, and I have played ALL OF THEM.
This game feels amazing, looks amazing, plays amazing. Just a bit dissapointed I did most of the stuff after I hit the initial level cap of 50, thus losing a ton of experience that would have easely got me closer to 70, but hey... let's grind some Region Battles!

THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH THE BASE PRICES

Pros (BaseGameOnly)
- Game looks nice
- Murder is hella fun
- Who doesn't love kicking people off mountains and watching them fall to their demise
- Cool horse skins
- Can fight interesting enemies like hair snakes
- Takedowns/Combat is pretty satisfying
- Story(so far) is engaging, I don't feel like I have no purpose or direction
- Tonnes of npcs to stab if you feel like starting a genocide
- Map is pretty big
- Naval battles are so fun
- RAMMING SPEED
- If you are a horrible person and want to watch npcs suffer virtually, you can knock them out then drop them in water and watch them drown, or drop them into fire, or simply roll them off a cliff and watch them plummet like a sack of turds
- Cool customization for character/ship/horse looks
- Can force horsey to cosplay My Little Pony
- Conquest(mini wars) are fun
- The game will constantly remind you to think before you do something

Cons (BaseGameOnly)
- Game runs like piss, don't expect good stable fps
- Can be grindy
- Missions can get repetitive
- Can't interact with romanced npcs or family after you finish their quests
- Costs for upgrading your ship can be steep, goes back to grinding
- Sometimes the assassinate/takedown buttom doesn't work and enemies will turn around to see your character standing behind them like an awkward goat
- Enemies can sometimes spot you through the roof
- On higher difficulties, direct combat with an enemy is not a test of skill but a test of how long you are willing to spend fighting some random guy that's not even a boss
- Game requires an internet connection to start(doesn't need a connection while playing)
- The game never fails to remind you that there is nothing more monstrous than humanity
- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ microtransactions in a singleplayer game
- Game will low blow you even while you're looking
- Could lead/contribute to depression
- 

Overall (BaseGameOnly): 7/10
- Exceeds the dollar per hour measure
- Pretty nice
- Only worth after 50% off at least
- Time consuming, often bland/repetitive
- Boring copypasted open world

DLC Legacy of The Blade: -10/10
PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DLC
- You fight a persian cult of kosmos basically
- Would have been cool to go to Persia but nah yeah nah
- Story elements either make no sense or have no explanation whatsoever
- No rpg element in the main quests(forced)
- Some new weapons and armor but meh
- New ship weapon but meh
- Doesn't link up to anything you have done in the main story
- Maybe some semblance of character development will be added in a later update(hahano)
- Voice actors sound like they are being underpaid and thus don't give a ♥♥♥♥
- Predictable and really lame overall
- Ending sucks

DLC Atlantis: 6.5-7/10

Episode 1: 
Episode 2: 
(Don't know why they call it Atlantis because you never actually go into Atlantis, or at least not yet)

Pros
- New cool glowly weapons and armor
- Each episode is in a new land/area/map
- Enemies have more/new abilities
- You get to interact with 
- You get to interact with some npcs from the main story
- You get to look cool

Cons
- Doesn't feel like you have much control over what happens
- Your choices don't seem to make much of a difference overall
- Feels a little forced at times, but not as bad as DLC 1 above.
- Story and the outcomes feel a bit conflicting/contradicting at times

Its fun and enjoyable pretty much as long as you don't think too much into things
I had fun but there were times i felt things were "off" or could be a lot better

If i had to guess, id say they're trying to set up something for the final episode of the Atlantis dlc which is why the story can feel kinda rough, because it needs your character to go down a certain path, which kinda sucks because you as the player don't really feel in control anymore. It feels more like you're being dragged around in a way, but certainly not as bad as the Legacy of the First Blade. If episode 3 turns out great then its good i guess but taking away player control in a game with consequences and the choice of multiple options for the player seems hella weird, but what do i know about story writing or making games? Im just a random ♥♥♥♥ on the internet writing a review.

Attention, this game is not really Assassin's Creed, it barely has 2 cutscenes about Assassin's Creed in it. And that is a good thing and let's hope it will stay this way.

First of all. it is a true God of War adventure set in Greece. You start out as a simple merc who turns into a demi-god. The epicness is everywhere and it feels like a standalone title set on explaining this world of Greece, Mythos, people and setting. The gameplay is that of a good (1st time in the series) RPG. It combines elements of many modern games such as Dark Souls in form of combat style with lock on, very good accurate dodge system (unlike Origins), and Parry, you can also roll by holding dodge longer. Getting behind opponents back is rewarded. Shooting bow finally feels accurate and steady too. It now depends upon your skill and not bad game mechanics. Enemies have good accurate hitboxes and their moveset is where you expect it to be. If you want you can play stealthy. There are plenty of abilites (3 classes, ranged, warrior, rouge) that you get to choose upon leveling up with several layers of levels to them. You can only have a certain amount of said abilities equipped at once ala Witcher 3. Overall, combat feels very very good and accruate this time around. If you have skill you can be sure you will not fail in this game. It is also fairly cinematic and bloody (if you enable blood).

The story is finally fun and has no kiddie hoodies (I am sorry I can no longer take Assassins in light of AC games seriously, they look like superheroes to me and I find them childish). The story is that of a fully fledged RPG that could be its own series, has little to do with AC games and it is good. The quests are Witcher 3 -esque. You can ask questions like in any other RPG and you get to make choices from time to time. Hell you can even romance. Quests are fun and this time around dialogue is cinematic which makes it fun to listen to (unlike Origins, in fact all the things Origins did even though it was a step in right direction are nothing compared to this game).

The exploration is fun and there is even a non-guided mod that allows you to play this game like an old school RPG where you are told to do something and there is no point to where to go, you gotta figure it out by listening to what people tell you. There are also investigation missions ala Batman Arkham series or Witcher 3. Loot is rewarding and it is fun to explore places looking for new cool boss fights and loot. Besides, the map itself is (oh again) Witcher-esque in a way that it has many locations marked with question marks that you can explore at will.

Interface is nice and is fully customizable this time around. I turned off a coupla three things straight away. Bounty meter, hidden player lightup (whatever it is called in game) etc.

Items have unique properties to them and various stats besides their good looks. You can really customize your character combining them with skills and adding engravings (like runes) with various stats to gear.

Like all movement climbing has been improved, it now feels much more realistic, fluid and fun. Kinda feels like you are doing unspeakable feats of breavery when you climb mountains like you are a part of a myth yourself climbing Olimpus. Horse navigation has been improved.

Finally, main characters. Alexios and Kassandra are both very fun and very good. I am saying this because right now there is an on-going trend which essentially tells people that Alexios is boring, bad voice acting, bland, etc well it is simply not true. First of all the animations are on par, 2nd of all the player model is great and the voicing is superb. I played Mass Effect Andromeda as Female (I'm a dude) but this time I felt more like playing as a male demi-god hero and it took me great pains to decide after hearing all this rant on how he is bad. Well he is not. In fact I like him more than Kassandra. The difference is Kassandra is lovely, she can be sad, or funny. He is more ruthless, angry, but also roguish. Both are good, but if you want to play male, don't fret pick Alexios you won't regret.

The only thing you might not like is level restriction which forces you to not engage something that is 5 lvls above you because you can do nothing to kill it. 4 levels is extremely slow and hard too, and so on. But this is not too much of an issue because game leads you from one area of level to the other so if you do not go exploring wildly you will be okay. Side quests are fun so it is not painful to level up. If you do wanna explore at will you can level up and abandon story for a bit and go explore regions that are suited to your level. Don't worry game will always be challenging in terms that enemies and quests will scale to your level if you out level them. So feel free to forget about main quest. However, if you do not want to level up you can (I strongly don't suggest) buy some boosters to level up but there are other ways to get your self level up on pc that do not require that. So if you so much desire you can get max level as the game starts and put it on hard and play it like a really really fun game that doesn't level lock you. But otherwise it is a standard RPG practice.

Graphics are crisp, terrain and architecture is top notch. It is all just so beautiful to look upon. Very very good and is very nicely done, not really taxing my system on high I get 50-60 fps in 1080 on 980 GTX and i7 980 which is an 8 year old CPU 1st gen of i7s albeit 6 cores with base speed 3,3. Ubi added AVX update in 1.03 that enables older cpus. 12 Ram.

Overall, this is the only game in Assassin's Creed Franchise that is really like while in the past I really liked AC 1, 2, Flag. Origins is not so bad but it was a 1st attempt and this is finally the mark. So please Ubisoft make quality games like this and do not do conveyor belt bad games anymore. Also, It feels good that people in your studios got tired of making the same game over and over and tried to experiment and it led you to such grand success. So use AC brand if you must but leave all the stuff that makes them Assassin's Creed and just keep making Odyssey styled RPGs.

-it gets boring

summary: i got bored of the game :( i dont recommend it because of the direction it is going

As a whole the game is awesome. You can really lost yourself into the beautiful world of Ancient Greece. A lot to explore, tons of interesting Quests.
The mechanics of the game are also interesting. The whole levelling system is similar to Origins. Finding weapons and gear is the same as the last game as well, finding weapons in loot chests. The only exception here is the armour, you find different sets and pieces in loot chests as well, which is fun. Some of the skills have to be assigned in a slot, and can be used in battle or stealth missions. It is a like a quick button for a certain ability, which you want to use in a particular situation.
BIG PROBLEM with the game is the constant crashing. If it wasn't for that I would have recommended the game, but at this state it is annoying to play. Random crashes. And even if you try some of the "fixes" that forums suggest, there is no guarantee that the crash won't appear again. I have tried everything that has been suggested to no avail. It appears no matter what you try, Ubisoft has s***ted this game as well.
If an eventual fix appears for that I will change my review, but as for now, it's a big no.
If you really want this game, get it on sale.

TL:DR
If you are an AC fan or you like Ancient Greece history, this game is definitely for you.

PROS
- Like in AC Origins, you get to play two characters, here a brother and sister. And yes, main story is different for each.
- At the beginning, the game feels quite similar with AC: Origins.
- True, there are the same team and concepts behind the game. But apart from taking place in the Ancient Greece (as opposite to Origins which was modeled in Ancient Egypt), Odyssey seems a little bit more fluid than Origins in game-play and has a much longer story than its predecessor.
- Nice story, beautiful graphics, great open world.
- No need to spend a dime in the game unless you want some of the rarest items available.
- As in AC Origins, you also have an arena to play.
- Obviously, like in Origins, you get a fully narrated Discovery Tour mode that takes you along all important places in the game (the ancient Greece modeled at scale) with real historical facts about the ancient Greece.
- With several improvements in the combat mechanics and using a different jump key (this time is SHIFT instead of SPACE that now goes to dodge function) the game does a good job at immersing you into the history of Peloponnesian wars.
- At times, for the sake of the main story, the historical facts are not accurately described.
- Don`t expect to see a lot of Abstergo or the Animus tech in Odyssey though, because like in Origins, the developer opted for a low-profile on the modern part of the franchise`s story, but I can`t say it does negatively affect the game at all.
- The main story is fairly long and if you want to spend more time in the game there are plenty of side chain-quests each with its interesting own story.

CONS
- If the game was not shaped for RPG (by using those annoying multiple boring dialogues instead of structured cutscenes) it would have been a wonderful game.
- Like many similar open-world games, you have to walk, swim or ride huge distances to get to objectives. But then you can just teleport in the discovered regions, so it's not a big issue.
- In-game micro-transactions, mainly cosmetics but EXP boosters too.
- A damn shame AC Valhalla is not available for Steam. That too.

Malaka! This game has consumed my life! It has been so enjoyable doing all the various side content and main story. The combat system is varied and allows for different playstyles. Having certain sets and switching between them has allowed me to play more how I want for what I am feeling. The end game fights are challenging and varied in tactics which is a lot of fun. I can't stop talking to people about this game. I would have to say this is my favorite assassin creed game and this is coming from someone who has played every mainline title game since the beginning.

My first day of playing Odyssey was great, just shy 8hrs of gameplay with zero issues. The next day I logged on and I have been consistently getting the same auto close issue where Ubisoft Connect needs to properly save and upload. So, I went offline on Ubisoft Connect and have had zero luck playing longer than 5-10mins at a time before it randomly out of nowhere auto closes the game again.

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey features a rich, lush world lessened by its repetitive activities. There are numerous moments where the loop of exploring, completing missions, and travelling can slow the pace significantly. Despite this, Assassin's Creed Odyssey's ambition is admirable, which is reflected in its rich attention to detail for the era and its approach to handling the multi-faceted narrative. Assassin's Creed: Odyssey builds on everything good Origins introduced, but with a bit lower quality stories.

I love this game, I think its a GOTY contender
Open World is perfected here ladies/gentlemen
The game looks amazing, plays well, the protagonist is great and well voice acted.
It's also a pretty big game. The main story (all 3 of em) are pretty gripping and took me around 40 hrs to complete
I always dreaded doing map completion in the previous games, especially in origins, but here the game is soo much fun to play It really doesn't bother me. The side quests although pretty basic are pretty entertaining to play through mostly because of the wonderful protagonist.
Even the present day moments, although is pretty small, is really well done.
The other whos in the genre can't compete. Its also being well supported after release with free DLC and quests.

I do not like the microtransactions though, although they can be earned in-game it takes too long and is behind a loot box mechanism

P.S. Kassandra >>>>> Alexios

It depends what you're looking for in this game. If you want a decent RPG to take up your time, sure go for it. If you're looking for a captivativing narative. Skip this game. If you're looking for a Assassins Creed game, Skip this game.

DON'T THINK TOO MUCH BUY IT BECAUSE IT'S GREAT GAME
BUT NOT AN ASSASSIN'S CREED GAME I WANTED!!!
Though,
I bought the ULTIMATE EDITION

I knw the backstory of how they have decided to make this game and name it assassins creed game but actually it isn't But if you want to judge the game differently you can.
Overall i liked the game and how even though it's repetitive a bit it wasn't boring and i really liked its RPG mechanics and it's more improved than AC ORIGINS

Pros
- Option to play either as Kasandra or Alexios
-HUGE SINGLE PLAYER STORY
-Smooth Control
-Improved Graphics
-Colorful Environment
-Freedom of doing anything
-Beautiful Map and every place is different
-New Weapons you can choose from
-Pick any sides you want to defend Athens or Sparta
-COOL LEGENDARY ANIMALS CHALLENGE
-Different mysterious Characters
- Witcher like choice option
-VERY GOOD OPTIMIZATION
-Play with ur own choice
-Realistic Characters that were present in history
-Updated Photo mode
-story creator mode (wooooohhhhh)
-Discovery mode
-Exciting Ship fight and controls
-Underwater looks dope
-Huge skill sets
- Fair Micro transactions
-Multiple Endings
-Everyday a new quest which makes u play this game everyday
Cons
-Bayeks story was better and their story was less emotional
-Alexio's facial expression was kinda generic
-Too much grind if u want a legendary outfit
-Not an assassins creed game because there is none
-No Side Map
-Tells u to buy things frequently from the store
-No loading screen like before

Overall i think it's a 8.5 from me out of 10.
I enjoyed the game and i will play more and it is worth to have in ur steam library

Honestly, as savage as it sounds, the truth hurts, but Ubisoft has gotten LAZY. They no longer put in the extra effort and time to perfect their games as they have with the older titles. They used to settle for exceptional games, but nowadays they aim for just ‘okay.’ Whereas they used to focus on experience and immersion, today it’s more tailored towards money and making the series a franchise of multimedia. Too many careless and reckless bugs/mistakes in their games nowadays unfortunately. Too much copy paste, too much idle banter and grindy tasks.

In my opinion, this particularly applies to Ubisoft Quebec, Both Syndicate and Odyssey, despite being fun solid games, are pretty much forgettable and don’t bring forth anything memorable or extraordinary. Both Syndicate and Odyssey lack a serious tone and include too many cringe jokes and unnecessary tasks, which evidently are forgettable and dismissible. The other games made by different developers take it more seriously, and are often better in story, gameplay, and direction. I’m sure they mean well, and by all means their optimization is superior in terms of balance and performance, as both Syndicate and Odyssey performed smoother than their previous title. Also provide beautiful worlds such as the UK and Greece.

I suppose Ubisoft should really figure out each of their different branches and their cons and pros and address them accordingly. I don’t like Quebec’s direction or narrative divisions, but appreciate and admire their graphics and stability department.

I was never fan of older AC games (except black flag), this is why i love Origins and Odyssey.
I remember people have infested forums with comments like "oh no AC is too much repetitive , no new element no new game-play , AC games are exactly like each other".
now they gave us something new (origin and odyssey) and suddenly those exact people became hardcore fan of expired/repetitive/no-innovation AC Games and crying about too much changes that happened to the series.
no hidden blade ? no problem, origins and odyssey are about the first ones and maybe they didn't have that thing before they formed their group , you know they don't usually born with a hidden blade in their asses.

I have a hard time recommending this game; there is a genuinely good experience in there, but this is definitely a flawed product.

The first, most persistent and most glaring issue is that it is simply far too padded in almost every way. Exploring such cities as Sparta and Athens would be fun, but the sheer scale of Odyssey's world (not at all aided by the lack of variety in most of these locations) makes exploring a chore. This is not at all helped by the rinse-repeat locations; there is little variety or joy in exploring different forts, guard camps, or tombs that all look exactly alike. While each of these activities are fun the first couple of times, the experience definitely becomes grating after a while.

The leveling system in this game certainly does not help matters. Certain zones are locked behind level-caps; your own skill as a player matters little as you are almost certainly unable to beat the foes in areas even a few levels ahead of you. Early in my experience I assumed this was the worst aspect of leveling, but I was mistaken. The true issue is also tied into the gearing system.

The original level cap for this game was 50; later expanded to 70, and as of this review expanded to level 99. Once you pass an area's level cap, the enemies own level raises to about two below your own, to keep the game interesting. However, your gear does NOT automatically level up with you; you must continually either find or upgrade gear. This is a problem, as under-leveled gear severely affects your capabilities. What is more, the cost of upgrading gear - something you will want to do frequently especially for legendary set bonuses - becomes prohibitively expensive the higher your level grows. It gets to a point where you genuinely hope that you DON'T level up, so that you can remain as competent as you currently are. This is a serious issue that affects basic enjoyment of gameplay.

This padding also affects the story; many times you feel like you are going through seemingly unnecessary busywork to progress to the interesting parts. This makes much of the game feel like a chore or a job, a deadly sin for any entertainment.

What makes all of this worse is that there are good moments in the story; your character's interaction with their family both found and by blood, the feeling of being an Greek hero straight from the epics. This is an RPG in the truest sense, where many storylines depend both on skilled gameplay and decision-making, often with unintended consequences. I do think that the game would have found more success if they had dropped the connection to the Assassin's Creed franchise altogether, as it seems clear that the writers had little interest of connecting it to the broader world of that story.

In the end, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. Watch videos of it, read articles, look at stories, but the actual experience is long, arduous, and just not entirely worth the sheer amount of time and effort it asks of you.

Beware! Some Malákas optimized this, especially FoA episode 3

1. Graphics and Optimization

The game looks colorful and great visually, especially some islands and certain DLC locations such as Elysium and Atlantis. Although this game runs mostly at 60fps with Vsync on (to prevent screen tear), this game has some serious stuttering. The game stutters randomly and frequently, which is quite frustrating. Although I did not face any crashes in the base game, when I got into the 3rd episode of the FoA DLC, the stutters became very frequent, and the game started crashing abruptly many times. If you google "AC odyssey Atlantis episode 3 crashing", you will see that it is a common issue.

My specs: RTX3060, AMD Ryzen 5 3600, 16 GB RAM. I tried changing the settings, especially the ones people recommend changing (lowering volumetric clouds, disabling fullscreen optimizations, updating drivers etc.). I have done a lot of research and watched many videos to fix these frequent stutters, only to realize that many face these random stutters even on high end machines. I even played and tested it on another system (GTX1060-6GB, i7 8th gen, 16GB RAM), but I found stutters on that as well.

And recently, during a free weekend, I tried AC Valhalla and it ran at solid 60fps with no stutters! If I have an RTX3060 and the latest AC game can run at 60fps with no stutters, why is this (the previous AC game) stuttering a lot? FFS, even RDR2 runs at constant 60fps. I heard that the devs have made a 60fps patch for new gen consoles, but why are they not optimizing this game for the PC platform or fixing the crashes in FoA episode 3 that many are facing? . Why is there a partiality? Do studios not care about PC users?

2. Story and gameplay

The story is interesting as it involves some cultists targeting your in-game family and it gets personal enough to keep playing. While the story is engaging, the mid to end game is a chore. You must kill 42 cultists across the map, and it is all rinse and repeat stuff. After some time, you would get fed up with clearing forts, clearing camps, fetch quests, etc. In short, the quests become repetitive. Ya want proof? The game itself acknowledges it 😊:

When the game itself admits that the quests are repetitive :)

Combat might feel a bit sloppy, and the combat animations (especially some animal animations during fights) might look a bit janky, but it is ok as you would get used to it. Early on, the enemies would be like bullet sponges. Even basic enemies would require a lot of hits to take down (even after levelling up and upgrading weapons/armour). However, during the mid to late game, you would get some great legendary weapons /armor sets and by then you would have some OP abilities and a great CRIT chance. I got the deluxe edition which has those temporary XP boosts which helped me level up fast. If you are getting the standard edition, get ready to grind (do copy-paste missions on message boards over and over), unless you are planning to purchase the XP boosters and other microtransactions to level up faster or gain resources instantly😊.

3. DLCs (non-free ones)

Fate of Atlantis

This DLC offers 3 episodes and all 3 are set in 3 separate locations, 2 of which are gorgeous. Although it looks good, the story is cringe-inducing and nonsensical. Also, the whole animus stuff and bringing back to modern day thing is so unbecoming that the story creators do not seem to have any innovative ideas to create a good lore. Even in the base game, there are these animus missions which sometimes start after doing some quests and take you to long loading screens and then you do some generic puzzles or walk to a place only to be rewarded with nonsensical dialogues. As I mentioned in the optimization section, 3rd episode of this DLC is where I experienced the worst FPS drops, stutters and crashes.
Legacy of the first blade

This is actually a decent DLC. I like how they added Persian cultists and Xerxes (Do not expect historical accuracy, their masks look cool though) to the story. Some people don’t like this DLC because some choices don’t matter, but it is an alright DLC considering how the Persian cultists play mind games with the protagonist and how personal it gets.

4. 100% completion

This game is a chore to 100% and it is going to take a lot of time. One day, I decided to 100% this game, not just all the achievements but all the side missions across the base game and the DLCs. It took so much time and it became so repetitive that I regret that decision even now. If you are targeting just the achievements, I would say around 150-200 hours considering all the DLCs. If you are targeting to complete all the achievements as well as all the side quests from all DLCs, then I would say around 300 hours, unless you are trying to rush through the game.

Some side missions are funny, and some are interesting, but most of them are repetitive fetch quests. But the good thing is that there is only one missable achievement in the whole game and that is in the FoA DLC. So, you wouldn’t need to replay the whole game to get any alternate ending achievements etc., which is weird for an RPG, but it is fine from a completionist’s perspective😊. Also, you would need both the DLCs to 100%.

5. Final words

Overall, the game is a bag of mixed feelings. The story is engaging enough up to a point and depending on how much you can tolerate repetitive tasks; you might end up either punting this to backlog or finishing it. I was planning to not give either a thumbs up or a thumbs down review. However, the problems I mentioned in the first section are severe and the fact that every major release or console port released is coming out unoptimized needs to get attention. We are paying for these products, and we expect them to be optimized.

116 hours later and a gazillion crashes later WITH NO WAY TO FIX THOSE CRASHES, i have finally completed the main game + all side objectives and missions.

Am i going to play the DLCs? Hell no, i've had enough of these crashes.

Did i have fun beside the game crashing all the time? Yes, i had lots of fun.

Would i recommend it? No. Only due to the game crashing all the freaking time, and the fixes that they list, do absolutely nothing to help you.

As someone who's played every Assassins Creed game in the franchise trust me, I'm well aware of the improvements Odyssey, and Origins have made over its predecessors. But, ultimately it's core elements haven't changed much and it's just something I can't stand by anymore. I've pretty much shelved this game knowing I wasted my money on it with no intent to finish it unfortunately. This will be the last game in the series I'll buy. Even despite its differences I still felt like I was playing the same games that I played before. It's just way too repetitive. Go here, call your eagle, mark the objective, complete the objective, rinse and repeat but discover things along the way. Take out some outposts, climb viewpoints to reveal the map, just a game that's whole goal is to ultimately complete a checklist. Don't get me wrong I genuinely like the RPG elements they decided to implement in the game. However, it doesn't add any flare to a dying franchise in my personal opinion. Ubisoft banks on this and the Far Cry series so hard they need to take a fresh start in another direction cause lets face it, the company is nowhere near as good as they used to be. They just care about money rather then the people they sell their games too. Considering the amount of micro transactions in the game as well I pretty much don't need to say anything else about that. I mean hey, everyone's different so by all means I'm sure other people will feel like I don't know what I'm talking about. Plus, I'll still admit if this is your first time dipping into the franchise then yeah, go for it. Buy the game and you'll probably like it a lot more then I did. You may even end up absolutely loving it. But coming from a person who's been playing these types of games for years, and years I'm just tired of being tired of them so to speak.

This game is a complete different re-imagination & huge open world rendition of the original Assassin's Creed series games!

Set in ancient Greek during the Peloponnesian war, the game takes you through an odyssey filled with magnificent and beautiful open world set on a huge scale. It's filled with an immersive & impressive storyline that sometimes have such twist & turns which makes you wonder what is true & what is lie!
You are a misthios….in a land of adventure, war, love, courtship, friendship, betrayals, joy, sorrow, fear & surprises. You can either be an Spartan or an Athenian or simply a soldier of fortune moving from one location to another in search for riches, it's up to you to be what you want to be. After all its your own Odyssey!

Here are some general pros & cons as per me.
Pros
Huge open world scale filled with beautiful & breathtaking landscapes of ancient Greece.
Pretty long & immersive storyline filled with so many choices that will dynamically alter your path & your story. Easily takes 50+ to complete the storyline & adding side-quests to that will drastically increase your playtime.
The game never feels boring. There is always something new to be discovered, something new to be encountered. Every settlements, every beach, every road, every stones tells an interesting story of time.
Graphics is really great. The details, the landscapes, the beaches, the sea, the mountains, the plains are all very aesthetically pleasing. The general graphical fidelity of the game is awesome.
Gameplay is pretty decent as well. Player controls like combat/ movement/ diving are pretty decent.
Good gears are not that hard to find & not very hard to upgrade either. Various resources are also distributed decently in the world map. More harder & more challenging missions gives more precious rewards.
Photomode is really cool & is very powerful. You will be able to capture beautiful virtual photographs if you decide to spend some time in the in-game photomode.
Custom quest maker seems awesome but I have not personally tried it yet.
DLC was pretty good & had a very good amount of new contents (new maps, quests, stories, weapons, armors, etc.) & Ubisoft kept pushing new contents for a decent amount of time.

Cons
Levelling up without is extremely painstaking! Ubisoft intentionally did it to push people towards their online store where you can buy XP & Coins boost. Kind of a ♥♥♥♥ move!
Game is not very well optimized. Huge areas & cities like Athens will bring your cpu & the framerate down to their knees on higher graphics settings....doesn't matter what CPU you have in your system.
Some gameplay features like horse riding through the towns & cities can be improved & polished even more.
Prices for various cosmetic items, weapons, armors, consumables, etc. in the microtransaction store are absolutely atrocious.
The fiasco regarding the custom quest maker exploit could have been handled by Ubisoft in a much better way than it was in my opinion.

Overall Ratings: 8.5/ 10

I like this game actually, I don't think it's a real assassin's creed game tho. Apart from that, the reason I don't recommend this game is because it runs like ♥♥♥♥. I have a decent PC. 1070, i7 6700k, 32 GB of DDR4. And this game can't get a solid 60 FPS at 1080p no matter what the graphics settings are at. It drops below 40 FPS most of the time. This game uses like 60%+ CPU usage in the main menu. Like what are you even doing in the freaking menu?
Ubisoft says this has nothing to do with DRM, I have my doubts. It has been proven in the past that Denuvo DRM has a negative impact on game performance (most of the time) and this game doesn't only use Denuvo it also uses VMProtect on top off Denuvo to protect Denuvo.

TL;DR: Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a great example on how you can iterate on mechanics throughout a franchise and still end up with a product that is significantly worse than any of its predecessors.

I'll first start speaking about the few things that I thought were good about this game. The environments are pretty and the historic structures are marvels to look at. I also appreciate the addition of a soft enemy lock on when you initiate an attack that was not present in Origins. This is beneficial to keyboard players as it allows you a measure of precision without having to rely on the lock on. The abilities that were added made combat scenarios more dynamic and enjoyable.

And now, the bad, and there's a whole lot of bad. Since I'm already on the combat I'd like to take a moment to address how it feels when compared to Origins. Both games mostly shy away from stealth and rely more on action rpg elements but Origins doesn't suck to play. Unlike the game before Odyssey draws out its combat scenarios by giving enemies larger health pools, attacks also lack the audio impact that they did in Origins. This leads to a situation where you every engagement just feels like you're chipping away some damage until the target dies. The personality that the different bow types had were instead replaced by abilities which are tied to a resource meter, making archery not as fun and free. The upgrade system instead of just being money only now requires materials which scale to ridiculous amounts. The rate at which you gain xp in the base game practically makes it necessary to grind the boring sidequests in order to progress in the main story. Quest design gets old very fast, there was a certain point in the story where every quest was *Talk to X person for information, X person says do something for me and I will help you, complete these 3 side objectives.* Also nobody in Ubisoft thought that you should be able to track multiple quests at once rather than switching between each? This has been a feature since at least games like Skyrim came out. Ship combat was brought back yet again but instead of being a fun experience like it was in Black Flag it merely feels like a means to pad out the large world map with copy pasted bases and camps. And finally the story, oh boy is it bad. Despite all the problems I mentioned I was kind of enjoying the story up until the third act. This is where the game becomes fetch quest simulator just so you can find one character and then after all of that it feels like it ends kind of abruptly and even in a contrived manner. Elysium DLC story was wack as well but at least the new environments are very pretty, though they are ruined by the same map filled with enemy camps design.

And for the last bit of my review I will quickly list off some minor annoyances:
Map design is as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle.
No sprint button means a fixed on foot movement speed
Horses have no sprint either even though in the first game they had it
Horse speed is slowed down automatically in cities unless you use mods to change it
Layla real world story makes me laugh

In conclusion, I don't like this game, Origins was actually fun and didn't waste my time. If you like run of the mill ubisoft open world games then this might suit you though

Like I've mentioned in my AC Origins review- I never got into the AC games. That changed with Origins, and while I think that game is far better in terms of story and main protagonist than this one its still a fun game. I played as Kassandra because I've read she's a better VO than the male. She did fine.

If you've played Origins than Odyssey will feel like more of the same. But there's a lot of things to do in the game, and I mean a LOT. Main quests, side quests, contracts, naval battles, Mercenaries, Cult leaders and more. It can be really overwhelming at first.

I ignored much of the main story at first as much as I could so I explore revealing sync points, camps, etc like in Origins, except here the flow didnt feel as good. For example, Id find a sync point which would reveal the question marks, great. But many times over it wouldnt reveal all of them so I'd have to backtrack and revisit to uncover the new ones. This happened a lot. You also cant travel to towns anymore. Alternatively though, if there's a ship dock in the area you can fast travel there. But there are also synchronization points awfully close to ship docks while large portions of the map dont have anything which seems like they want to pad out the playtime.

The weapons, armor and loot are all there and if was fun getting new gear. The engraving system is a nice touch as well. I didnt care for much of the ability tree as its mostly reliant on new abilities and found maybe 4 or 5 I really liked. I was hoping there would be some upgrades like running faster.

I completed the main story, as many side quests I could find, a few dozen contracts, killed all the Cultists and discovered all the regions, sync points, and camps. Took me about 125 hours.

The Best Open World AC game ever in the Franchise and the story is too good......
The Duration of the full game is about min 70+ hours and the best one ever with lots of elements and many to do in the game.... Greek Mythology characters were the best:)
Overall an enjoyable experience :)

i like how ubi just decreases xp and increases upgrade prices randomly, totally not making the game a bigger grind than it already is and selling off microtransactions.

It's a full priced video game, which they will not drop since its ubi, addons are paid and now microtransactions are basically necessary for a enjoyable experience in this game

good game ruined by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ decisions

0/10 ubi ♥♥♥♥ you

Odyssey feels like it should have come before Origins. It feels less refined, world is more boring, and assassinations are becoming an afterthought. If you are a fan of the franchise but don't like the direction the series is going, however you still want to play the new iterations - just get Origins.

I have greatly enjoyed this game and played it to 100% completion, after 80 hours or so. I admit i was never an AC fan, i always found their gameplay tedious. This has nothing to do with that kind of gameplay. Gorgeous, vast, and technically superb even on my 2015 rig, i did not regret buying full price. All AC games should strive for this level of quality from now on.

AC Odyssey is a RPG developed and published by Ubisoft. It's completely different from earlier installment of AC games - since it ditches the stealth based mechanics and adopts the concept of an open-world .

Starting with the narrative set in the modern day, the game follows characters named Layla Hassan and her friend Victoria, who with the help of assassins, manage to find DNA of 2 "Misthios". Using the DNA of one of the misthios, they activate the "ANIMUS", in-order to find the location of the Staff of Hermes - there by kick starting the odyssey in Greece.

The game's historical story is set in Greece, a few hundred years before the events of Assassin's Creed Origins which was set in Egypt. AC odyssey time-line occurs during Peloponnesian War, which was fought between Sparta and Athens. The player takes on the role of a young misthios and can chose between Kassandra or Alexios. AC odyssey tells us the "greek tragedy" of the protagonist and how the character continues with his "journey" to find and mend his fractured family. .

PROS:
-----
- A visual masterpiece - The visual depiction of Greece in its full glory is unbelievable. Greece is split into multiple regions and each region looks breathtaking. The level of accuracy, attention to detail is second to none. I have spent countless hours, in awe, navigation through various areas just for the sake of exploration.

- Memorable Characters - Apart from the protagonist, there is a huge array of supporting cast, which are seen through out the game. Players encounter prominent personas, including Alkibiades, Brasidas, Kleon, Herodotos, Hippokrates, Plato, Pythagoras, Sokrates and many others. Not to mention the countless love interests protagonist has in this game. It looks like ubisoft wanted to get a step further than EA when it came to romantic interests.

- Combat - AC odyssey combat is different from its predecessors. It features an in-depth combat mechanic - which comprises of 3 major trees. Hunter (Ranged), Warrior (Melee) and Assassin (Stealth). There is another additional option named "Mastery" which is available to the player after a certain level. Mastery will help the player sharpen hunter, warrior & assassin skill trees further by increasing their stats. Players can build their characters the way they want. Last but definitely not least, NAVAL COMBAT, which is brings an additional dimension in combat.

- Weapons and Armor - AC Odyssey presents the user with insane amount of weapons and armor. The user has the option of collecting armor sets (which is bit of a grind) that boosts stats of the player in an unique way or mix n match with armor pieces. Weapons, like Armor, are divided into four types of rarity - Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. This is a very broad topic to discuss and also depends on the play-style of the individual.

- Mythology - Greek mythology started as purely academic for me but I fell in love with the legends and the complex stories . The stories of Hercules, Troilus and Cressida, Hector, Ajax, Odysseus, Jason, Theseus, Paris, Agamemnon and many other larger than life characters, their amazing journeys,kept me hooked. Not to mention gods, their power struggle and their complex stories. I am not a greek history or mythology expert, my point of view is purely from a person who used to love these stories/characters as a kid and how the game reminded me that they are more than just stories and I was able to connect with it.

- Mercenary tree - Ubisoft has introduced something which can be related to "Nemesis" system in Middle earth Shadow of mordor. There will be mercenaries out to hunt the player, based on the notoriety the player has caused on a specific region. The more notoriety the player has created, the higher the bounty that will be placed on the player. Once the bounty is placed/accepted, the mercenary starts to track down the player. A maximum of five mercenaries can hunt a player at any time. Some of the best weapons in this game can be obtained from these mercenaries.

- Story - Greek mythology, with amazing characters, family conflict and many more aspects are wonderfully inter-woven and presented as a complete package. Not to mention, great side stories, which makes the game even more interesting. Player choice is worth the mention - as the story becomes distinctly different based on the choices that the player makes throughout the game. The story tends to get deviating at times, but at its core, it is an extremely competent narrative which is better than most of its predecessors - IMO.

- Open world - The open world which contains stunning Greek landscape, ranging from forests with predators/animals, to the caves, temples and tombs the player can explore, to the majestic white marble buildings in cities, finding artifacts and everything in between. The journey from one city to another, with dolphins and whales the player can view while travelling on sea - is amazing.An open world like no other. See it to believe it.

NEUTRAL:
-------
- Story creator - Story Creator Mode is a utility that allows an user to create customized missions. This mode allows you to select characters, tasks, areas & items that will be part of your mission. In addition, you can write your own dialogues to make your quests unique. I didn't use this feature at all, so i do not have an opinion on this.

NOT SO GOOD:
-----------
- This game is long, i mean very very long and it took me 211 hours to finish the game - along with all DLC's and side quests. Ubisoft wanted this game to be "never ending" and I , for one, am not at all complaining. But there is a good chance that some people may find this a little frustrating or off-putting - since it can tend to get repetitive.

- "Siege / conquest battles" or battle in general will fail to provide any sort of challenge and will tend to "look" the same - when the player reaches a certain level - even at extreme difficulty. Plus, the player becomes a "demi-god" who deals insane levels of damage, at some point of time in the game, which makes most battles trivial. These things can be a bit off-putting to many players.

CONS:
----
- One of the things which bothered me is that the game doesnt "conclude" on completing the vanilla variant of the game. The "real" ending can only be accomplished by playing a dlc called "The Fate of Atlantis" - which the user needs to buy additionally. This should not have been the case and Ubisoft has a set a very bad trend by making the user pay more so as to finish the game.

-Micro transactions - Micro transaction shop uses Helix Credits, which are bought with real-world cash or Ubisoft Club points - to obtain many gear sets(which are not available in game) and cosmetics (especially skins).Ubisoft also introduces a way to "help players save time" - a pay to win method of gaining experience quickly, since the game is bit of a grind. Let me be honest in saying most of the resources needed to upgrade/progress are available in-game and you would need to grind to get it. The grind not impossible or even extreme, but is one hell of a grind nonetheless. The grind can get to some players and ubisoft providing this "optional" method of quickening player experience can entice a lot of players into buying them. It looks like they created this "problem" to sell you the solution. A horrible practice IMO - Malaka.

CONCLUSION:
-----------
Is this the best AC game? It's subjective. I have only played AC1 and the exceptional AC Black Flag - which puts me in the casual category. Personally, for me, AC Odyssey is a tie with Black Flag. A beautifully crafted Greek world, great story,amazing open world, with countless hours of fun, with un-forgetable characters, mixed with greek mythos - in-short an exceptional RPG experience, despite the "Not so good" & "Cons" mentioned above. To the AC casuals like me, I would say, go for it and you will have an unforgettable experience.

It is bigger than any previous work, and it has recreated the magnificent ancient Greek appearance with unprecedented grand scale and unique perspective.

Its a great game, but they should change the name because this is not an Assassin's Creed game even if it's better.

First of all want to say thanks for my good friend who gifted me this game, love ya! :)

Finished this game completely and base game was prety cool comapred to Origins

Main story from base game was interesting and one of better ones in whole series.

Some new interesting game mechanincs, pretty good weapons "grind", funny missions and it appears some choices matter during missions!

About dlc's:

Legacy of the First Blade - not that bad as people say, i pretty much liked it, tho some missions were pretty boring.
The Fate of Atlantis- nice DLC with some interesting story and some cool events in them. Some missions were done really well some not but overall it is ok. Also you meet some interesting characters along the way.

As a fan of series who played all AC games i can totaly recomend it to everyone :)

The game start promising but it take just a few hours before you realize that you will repeat exactly the same thing through all the game . The story is mediocre at best if not simply uninteresting . I tried several time to continue my playtrough just because I wanted to see the mythological creature at the end but it was just to repetitive and the gigantic but generic copy and paste map do not help it . SO :

Boring story , can't believe professional scenarists and writters work on such an unengaging story . For one hour of interesting and engaging story mission you will do 10 or 15 hours of boring quest for npc who don't want to help you if you don't help them first . The result of this is 75% of mainquest is filled with mediocre sidequest level content.

Boring ''ubisoft style'' gameplay loop , ( find the tower ) ( kill the captain) conquest battle look great the first time but you will do these so often in the game that it become old very quickly .

Boring world map , copy and paste temple , house , farm , landscape look pretty much the same in every zone with a few exception here and there , especially near sparta .

Combat are OK and the power progression feels good. Build possibilities are limited and feels pretty much the same but its better than nothing .

Litteraly don't understand how this game was nominated at the games awards last year .

The game is huge, packed with content with vast and beautiful world to explore.

Main story is pretty decent with multiple endings.

Side quests are plenty, some are long chain events that have interesting characters that you get to know and meet again multiple times through the game and there are also filler quests that are less interesting, but part of any game of this size.

Voice acting is pretty good, especially two playable characters did great work.

There are plenty of armor and weapons with nice skins that you can apply at any time once you discover them.

Combat is kinda mixed bag. I mostly like it, but difficulty is unbalanced. I usually play game on highest difficulty, but here it's a chore and looks ridiculous as you stab enemy 50x and he's laughing at your face. Only at the end game when you are nearing level 50, you'll be able to have a build and gear to take spongy enemies down quickly enough.

One of the most frustrating annoyances are civilians, who randomly aggro and join the fight against you for no reason. You are fighting guards or bounty and suddenly a guy with a broom decided to play a hero and comes poke at you.

Romances are terrible. They are basically all one night stands and are just cringy and akward.

Micro-transactions have no place in single player games!

To everyone who like long games, exploration and taking their time with first playthrough, I can recommend the game. To those that just want to rush main story and maybe a side quest here and there, game might feel "grindy".

I absolutely love this AC game.
A gigantic map in a beautiful setting, a good main story, side quests out the wazoo, an extremely minimal amount of "present day" stuff, fun action both on land and at sea, jump off anything and you (finally!) won't fall to your death.

I haven't played any Assassin's Creed games prior to this one so I can't compare it but coming into it new, it has hours and hours exploitative game play and combat options. I love the scenery, I love being able to choose what kind of 'assassin' I can be, and I love the dialogue/story. It's so immersive and vast. I definitely would suggest this for anyone who likes exploitative/RPG quest type games like Skyrim or Zelda Breath of the Wild. Music is amazing as well!

Brought a flight ticket off to Ancient Greece for £29.99, more than worthy I can tell.

Probably will fly with Ubisoft to ancient Nordic islands another time depending on whether the box office is on Steam or not.

A step in the right direction of the AC franchise which completely forgets about Desmond's storyline.

Game is as all other AC titles but vast map with alot of things to do , level cap is now 99 level which is kind of meh but alright I guess.

Also,ending was bad IMO and didn't offer closure to Kassandra's-Alexio's story.

I did my playthrough with Kassandra and I really liked her acting and overall personality.

I recommend this for people who don't read too much into the lore and want to have fun with an okay/makes sense story.

TL;DR A game about family & murder

Perhaps a bit too late, but the developers of Assassin's Creed have at last released their Magnum Opus.

I am no stranger to Assassin's Creed. I own most of the games, including Bloodlines (that PSP exclusive), 2, Brotherhood, Revelations, 3, Black Flag, Rogue, Unity, Syndicate and now Odyssey. That being said, my relationship with the franchise is... interesting to say the least. Being a history buff, my main appeal to the franchise is the ability to explore open-world cities from history. I enjoyed the franchise for many years, but that peak was probably around Black Flag (my personal favourite). After that, I lost interest. I bought Rogue because it wrapped up the Kenway trilogy. I bought Unity simply because of my fascination with the French Revolution and consequent Napoleonic Wars. I bought Syndicate because I am British myself and wanted to explore London as it was in the Victorian era. After Syndicate, however, I stopped. I never bought Origins. Even though Ancient Rome is one of my favourite periods in history (Origins being set in Egypt at the same time as Caesar rose and fell from power), I no longer felt compelled to play the series.

Fastforward to Odyssey. By this point, it's a few years since I have last purchased an Assassin's Creed game. I have little-to-no interest in the franchise. I don't watch any of the trailers, I don't even know the names of the main characters. I see the game on sale, a month or two after release, and decide to try it out. Why not? The game series has rarely been a disappointment in the past.

With my expectations at rock bottom, prepared to use the game as a filler whilst away from uni for Christmas, I started up Odyssey.

My, oh my, was I blown away.

Further research answers many questions. It appears as though after the controversy of Unity, the developers took extreme measures to re-direct the franchise. It is evident, though I don't want to draw too many similarities, that they took a lot of inspiration from The Witcher games. Odyssey is, quite clearly, a narrative driven RPG and very different to previous installments. I, personally, feel as though this was a good decision.

This has, it must be said, divided the fan base. There are many (and I am sure you have seen them scrolling through the reviews) who are upset at this game because it's not really an Assassin's Creed game. And, to be fair to them, it isn't. But that doesn't matter. There is no Creed, there are no Templars, there are no hidden blades, not much from the start of the franchise is left standing by Odyssey. However, this was a necessary loss. The franchise was becoming dated and Ubisoft made the executive decision to evolve into the RPG that Odyssey is.

The first thing that hits you when you play the game is how beautiful it is. The graphics are incredible, especially on PC. It runs very well, there are almost no bugs or glitches, even without mods it looks and runs better than most other games I own that I have decided to mod. The map is huge. I honestly think it is the largest open-world map I have ever played, spanning all of Greece from Themoplaye in the North to Krete in the South without a single barrier or loading screen seperating regions or city entrances. It truly is remarkable and the attention to detail is mind-blowing.

The characters are incredibly varied and well written, the story is compelling. The combat, though poor by the standards I am used to (see: Mount & Blade: Warband), is certainly more challenging than previous Assassin's Creed games (and better than the likes of The WItcher 3). All in all, I am thoroughly impressed (and suprised) by Odyssey. Ubisoft evidently worked hard on this title, and to be frank, if it didn't have the words 'Assassin's' or 'Creed' in the title I am sure it would be gaining far more receptions. In a year when Red Dead Redemption 2 was released, Ubisoft have not messed around and have made a genuine attempt to compete.

There are, of course, some issues with the game. From a franchise perspective, it has very little in common with the other games which, as already mentioned, does upset some people. Other issues include the fact that there is a levelling system. This is in some ways beneficial, because it forces you to do the side-quests and things in order to progress with the story or even to get to a high enough level to safetly explore certain regions. However, my gripe with it includes the fact that it limits the exploration and freedom allowed in the game and it also means that certain items - armour and weapons - become obsolete the moment you level up. Some people are apparently complaining about pay-to-win and spending money on exclusives? I am thoroughly in to this game without spending a single £ more than when I initially purchased it, nor have I been hinted to do so. I don't know where people are coming from with this.

All in all, a thoroughly ambitious, enjoyable and unexpectedly impressive entry to the Assassin's Creed universe.

Beautifiul surroundings/graphics. Absolutely stunning here & there. Some very good ideas. Echo's of Skyrim/Oblivion.

However. Severely marred by AC's ATROCIOUS LEVELLING!!! Why oh why do they stíll insíst on taking all the fun out by nerfing the player in any way possible.

1 or two levels above You? Good luck. Die a lot. 3 levels? Completely impossible.

Wouldn't be a big problem...... If the levelling went at a good pace. Well. It doesn't. Grind, grind, grind aaand some more grinding. At a snails'pace.

The utterly obnoxious levelling doesn't end there though. No, Ubi got even more nastieness awaiting. Enemies level ALWAYS 1 or two levels above your character, éven in places You already did. That's just sh***y design, not "good gameplay with a challenge" It gets even worse: Enemies SEEM to be Your level, so.. should be beatable at a normal way.. but noooo.. level 21 is áctually level 24 at the least..ergo: "same level" almost always means "at least 2 levels higher, and basically unbeatable when they're mercenaries" What a crock.

Ugh. Well. Luckily they ported it quite well. On a GTX1080 and a i7 5820 with 32gig RAM It runs between 45 and 60 fps on 2:1 widescreen @ 3440x1440 with settings on ultra. Not bad.
Oh, and not unimportant: They fixed saving. There's an actual 'quick save' now.

But.. Grdmnt! Ubi.. If I wanted a grind-fest, I'd start-up some Korean RPG.
Shame on me, thinking it would be different this time.
This seems to be the way to sneaky force players with a bit less time, say, by having a job.. (THAT PAYS FOR THIS GAME) or a family-life, into micro transactions? And don'r give me 'git gud' The game just blows in the department of levelling, and that totally turns me off.

So, absolutely no recommend from me. Micro-transactions should die, die, die. And the beancounters forcing it on the players by nerfed levelling, should all be fired.. or flogged.

After 30+ hours trying desperately to like the game, and only getting up to level 21 ( not that this makes any difference.. Your enemies will 'suddenly' be level 22 or 23 by then) I give up. (And ubi can stick their DLC where the sun don'shine. They just lost a sale.)

Aaand another bit of nastieness: All Your 'special' powers, except for fire and poison, will be disabled when an end-boss ( mythical creature) has aboot 10 to 15% health left. Nasty way to prolongue gaming-time.

EDIT:

Several patchers later, it finally is a game worth my time & money. Levelling is fixed by allowing several settings for the baddies'levels. ( Ubisoft's silent admitting it was borked from the get-go? )
Special power-bug is also fixed.

Still. Why didn't they do it from the get-go? I still get the vague stench of money-grabbing in my nostrils, though far less than it was.

ahh ubisoft you did it again
the game is awesome and good fun. as you progress through the mainstory and reach higher levels you have to do more and more boring sidequests. but no worries! after you bought a full price single player game you can buy XP to progress faster. what a brilliant bussiness model...

(Bought this game on PS4 and got it again when it went on sale)
If I had to use a single sentence to describe this game, it would be "Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle". At first glance, the world's size and stunning visuals are absolutely incredible but past that you'll realize just how joyless it is to explore. Past a certain point the movement speed is particularly tiresome as it often fluctuates between an agonizingly slow walk and a run that makes trekking the overworld bearable. Cities in particular are incredibly frustrating as they slow your horse’s speed to a crawl once you are within their radius. The sidequests are little more than something you would see out of an MMO paired with shoddy voice-acting, ugly facial animations and repetitive tasks that are usually "kill x" and come back. All of these inconveniences only serve to make the game more of a chore. You’ll quickly realize, just as I did, that everything about this game is designed to waste your time.

Past the prologue each story mission is purposely stretched out just a few levels above your own so that you'll be forced to grind to continue. If you don't want to spend hours grinding, Ubisoft has a solution (to a problem created specifically for you to need it). For hardcore players, this isn't a huge issue since they don't mind grinding- but it wasn't intended for hardcore players. This predatory practice was intended for casual players. Combat in this game does not make grinding fun at all. There is no intricate and varied combat system to reward practice and mastery developed through grinding, it’s just a mediocre, sluggish, and buggy system coupled with jarring animations. The character moves and acts like a diseased leper that ♥♥♥♥ its pants but desperately wants to cover it up so that nobody notices. Stealth is no longer a one-hit kill; you'll often be forced to either engage in godawful combat or use vanish and wait for the braindead AI to finally ♥♥♥♥ off.

Finally, the parkour. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ parkour. One of the quintessential elements of the franchise is no longer a thing. You can now scale any surface without a thought and since gameplay is mostly comprised of riding on your horse from A to B across long stretches of land, you'll no longer be engaging in what is, in my opinion, the most fun aspect of Assassin's Creed. This tedious time-sink of a game is just another unimaginative product rolled out by Ubisoft as they continue to cash in on an IP that should’ve died several entries ago, only further sullying what was once a top-tier franchise.

Purchased it during the christmas sale. Gold edition. Which contains the season pass and the game. So i spend €20 extra for 2 big expensions that are coming up + Assassins Creed 3 remastered, which is in my top 3 of Assassins creed games so far. Not big money.

Real talk now:

I have not touched Assassins Creed since Black Flag. The next few games after it was obvious Ubisoft tried to milk out the series a bit by releasing unfinished Assassins creed games with many bugs.

To keep things short: The world is HUGE. There are TONS of islands and things to explore. The side missions are nicely done. Every sentence you choose in a conversation against people can be crucial for the story line. You can decide to kill people or to spare their lives. Sometimes it will work against you, even if you thaught you did the correct thing....

Pro's

- Huge World!
- Story is good, not touching but good enough. (8/10 story)
- Graphics look stunning in the old Greece era
- You can choose if you want to be a man / woman in the story
- At the start of the game you can choose in many options how you like to play it. (Difficulty, explore modus, etc).
- Alot of missions, side missions and things to explore. It will always keeps you busy whatever youre doing in the world
- Every conversation can be positive for you, but sometimes it will work against you! Doesnt matter if you spare someones live or help the person with the quest.
- Nice combat system with alot of abilities to choose from

Cons:

- €60 is a bit expensive for an Assassins Creed game, especially the gold version including the season pass for €100 is really expensive. Get it on a Steam Sale (%50+ discount) and its absolute worth the money.
- Deluxe edition of this game is just a cash milk cow for Ubisoft. Dont waste your money on it, even in a Steam Sale. Those boosts and armor is dumb because you will level up kinda fast anyways and there is so much variety of armor in the game itself.
- Can be a bit repetitive (will avoid spoilers but you will find out later on anyways)
- Guards are dumb. They loose you way too fast. You can be chased and go into a bush and they lost you already

Just get it like i said in a Steam Sale and its a steal. 8.5/10 game for me.

Honestly, more than 300 hrs have been spent on this amazing "Greek tourism simulator" on PlayStation 4 pro since the release date in Oct. 2018.
Ubisoft has successfully resurrected eminent persons inside the virtual world and restored world-famous Greek historical constructions throughout the regions of ancient Greece and isolated islands of the Aegean Sea.
As a player, you are definitely able to immerse yourself into the mysterious but attracting Greek world to enjoy the gorgeous sightseeing and learn relevant history of Greece through completing main quests during the Peloponnesian War involving Athens and Sparta in the base game.
In addition to the original main and parallel storylines where you will attempt to restore the fractured family and encounter and stop the malign cult, players will find that Kassandra or Alexios is the ancestor to Aya, wife to Bayek and founder of the Assassin Brotherhood in the first DLC while confronting the Order of the Ancients.
Moreover, you are going to experience three fabulous simulated virtual Greek mysterious world if 2nd DLC is purchased and encounter and defeat a range of gods from Greek Mythology like Persephone in the paradise of Elysium, Hades in the underworld and Poseidon in the Atlantis. After exploration of three maps, the fate of Atlantis will be ultimately revealed as well as various special legendary gears, weapons of which you are suggested to choose the epic tier being equipped and techniques that enhance your several existing abilities to a great extent being learned.
Both the base game and the season pass are highly recommended to purchase and you will never regret by doing so.
Guys, the myth of ancient Greece is awaiting you to explore!

So I played about 80+ hours I think, long enough to complete all of the main quest, and whatever side quests were required so that I could level up and continue main - I did not buy the DLC because the base game was deeply dissatisfying and I won't give it any more of my money.

This game has a litany of issues: The combat is confusing and not as weighty as Origin's - if you want to stafe literally ever you have to use their weird toggle lockon (seriously, give players the option to strafe or make the lockon a hold-button option), The story occasionally waxes interesting - but the premise of mercenary goes out into the world is stale, and the story takes dozens of crappy shortcuts because apparently properly grounding the story in good dialogue and solid sci fi themes was too much. This game is also much buggier than Origins - which leads me to my next, much bigger point:

This game is too damn big - it's so big picture oriented that the small picture moment-to-moment gameplay suffers deeply because of it. The sheer size of the game is a massive contributing factor to why the combat, story, and resiliancy of this game have suffered - by the simpler virtue that on the dev side there was too much to do, too much to test and in the end it apparently could not all get done.

AC: Origions, in my opinion, was an excellent change of pace - it was atmospheric, gripping, and rewarding to play. Odyssey did not have any of those things in comparison. There's very little atmosphere beyond greek capitalism, the story is clunky and trips over itself, and after a while finding gold and mats feels less like a reward and more like a grind.


This game is not all horrible, and I hope the good parts carry forward:
- Visual customization of the character is good
- Having the character react more often to Isu ruins helps ground the player in that character's view, and gives us context for how those ruins should make us feel - the era of the silent protagonist is over, give me perspective.
- Once you level way, waaaay up the combat becomes bearable and even a little fun - being able to spartan kick dudes or insta kill them is the big good feel.
- Sailing is still awesome, not really much to say there. Thought Origin's had better ship combat but only because their combat was new and weird - Odyssey ship combat was still good, liked cutting other ships in half.

In conclusion, save your money for Valhalla - go watch this game on Youtube

Excellent setting, story and characters. Legendary Hellenes like Socrates, Alcibiades, Pericles, Aspasia along with characters created for the game come to life vividly, with the exact right amount of cheesiness to make them videogameworthy. Assassinations are still fun, with some added nuances that have made it better. Combat is solid, with plenty of weapon types and abilities. Life at sea and naval combat is as enjoyable as ever, but a little simplistic compared to Black Flag. Massive amount of content including new additions such as epic battles and randomly generated missions. Duelling mercenaries, heroes and other special characters is a joy. The gameworld seems to intelligently level up along with the player character. which means the player never really gets too overpowered. You can still find weak / underleveled enemies, but never more than two levels below you.

<오딧세이 + DLC 두 편 정주행 도전과제 92개 완료>
원래 본편 완료하고 리뷰를 썼었는데 DLC까지 다 하고 다시 씁니다.

결론적으로 어크 팬이라면 좋아할만한 작품입니다. 작품 성격이 오리진과 똑같은 "어쎄신이 나타나기 전이라 전사라서 괜찮아!" 컨셉입니다. RPG 요소가 많이 들어가서 템 파밍과 스킬 트리를 자신의 입맛대로 조절할 수 있습니다.

오리진과 첫 인상은 비슷할 수 있는데, 더 나아가기 위해 아래와 같은 여러가지 시도를 했고 그 부분에는 좋은 점수를 주고 싶습니다. 유비 여행사의 시티 투어/여행 패키지는 여전합니다.

- 진행 시 여러가지 선택을 할 수가 있고 어느 정도는 유의미한 분기점이 있습니다 (엔딩도) 다만 엄청나게 다르지는 않습니다. 자기 선택의 결과가 스스로에게 돌아온다는 것 정도..?

- 스킬트리가 분화가 잘 되어 있고 (전사, 어쎄신, 사냥꾼) 스킬트리를 어느정도 자유롭게 바꾸면서 놀 수 있습니다. 이 부분은 확실히 오리진에 비해서 업그레이드가 된 것 같네요. (다만 DLC 쪽으로 가야 더 보강이 됩니다)

본 편을 제외하고 두 개의 DLC가 있는데 암살검의 유산과 아틀란티스의 운명입니다.
암살검의 유산은 본편과 같은 맵을 공유하고 상대적으로 플탐이 짧습니다. 아틀란티스의 운명은 총 세 개의 완전히 새로운 맵으로 되어 있고 굉장히 매력적입니다. 아틀란티스의 운명 강력히 추천합니다.

어쩐지 오딧세이는 아틀란티스의 운명까지 다 해야 완성이 되는 느낌이 드네요. 플레이하신다면 시즌패스 추천드리고, 하나만 고르신다면 아틀란티스의 운명 꼭 추천합니다! 재미있게 플레이했습니다, 개꿀잼!

*참고로 현재 8/4 기준으로 도전과제 하나는 아직 딸 수가 없습니다. (93개 중 92개만 가능) 조금 기다리면 나온다고 하는데 언제 나올지 모르겠네요.

So finally after 80+ hours of in game time I finished AC Odssey and let me tell you it was the best mind blowing open world game i've ever played (literally). This game is on Its own league.Odyssey’s world is the biggest and most vibrantly colorful of the series the graphics is jaw dropping. The game is not at all similar to origins the mechanisam is totally different a lot has changed i would say. I really (live) the story of this game the character buildup, the emotional attachments, sometimes the decisions were hard but it was worth it.You have in your mind an idea of what an Assassins Creed game is from the few you have played in the past, right? But here you have no idea
You have never experienced the AC world in this way. Vast, beautiful, detailed and completely immersive. Sea battles, cultist hunts, mythical characters, large scale land battles, and of course.. assassinations.Character leveling and customization is well done and a cast of support npc's that make the game more keen to playing a movie at times.The outcomes depends on your decisions so choose wisely.There is till much left to do tons of quest.
Pros:
A vast, utterly rich deep & engrossing story.
Best heroes to date.
A world that keeps on giving.
Cons:
None
I would totally recommend to blindly buy this game.
11/10

Great game. Doesn't really feel like an assassins creed game, but that's not a bad thing. I think everyone was getting a little fatigued with the franchise and Ubisoft did a great job at mixing things up!

Don't play if you like short campaigns... main story took 50 hours to beat and there are so many sidequests and missions that it gets a little overwhelming at times. Love the RPG implementations though, I give it a 9.5/10.

The only things that I think Ubisoft could do better is optimize the game a little bit more and give more depth to the side missions. Other than that the game is an absolute masterpiece. Best AC game since 3, in my opinion.

It sucks that the game cannot be started without first connecting online to ubisoft. Kinda takes away from the entire purpose of what the steam deck is trying to serve.

This game is a masterpiece. Absolutely stunning, and you really get your money's worth with the sheer amount of hours you can sink into this game (and I say this with 270 hours spent so far). The map is huge with so much to explore. Yes it has its issues, but I've really enjoyed this game and a highly recommend it, especially if you're a fan of open world RPGs.

It goes without saying that it's a must for Ancient Greece enthusiasts, but I highly recommend it for non-philhellenes too, as it has a rich storyline, beautiful immersive environment and fun gameplay with all sorts of details to keep it interesting!

You can tell that an amazing work has been done when after playing it for 70+ hours you can still notice new, small, amusing details in the game every time you play.

The only thing that let me down a bit is that I was really hoping that at least this part of the franchise would have the Greek language as a fully implemented option, not just as occasional background chatter!

PS: if, like myself, you also shake the hose at the gas station to get that last drop of fuel that you paid for into your car tank, make sure you wait for a sale before buying :)

ok. ok. ok. i shall start by saying i actually despise AC games, not that i think they are badly made, but they are everything i don't enjoy in a game. this game however, is one of the best games i've discovered in years. i went normie, and yet still sank loads of hours into this game. it offers an in depth amount of exploration, PLENTY of questlines, breathtaking environments which don't take much PC power to run, and customisable classes to match your preferred playstyle. it's a game you can drop in and out of if you have a main game, but does require a lot of your time considering the amount of content.

also would like to say i didn't experience this 'grind' people mention negatively - sometimes quests were a few levels above me, but there was more than enough side quests around to get me there. so, if you just want to stick to main quests, you will have a bad time! (also why would u spend £50 to only do main quests lol)

"Όμορφη και Εκστατική" -Beautiful and Ecstatic


Assassin's Creed Odyssey goes way back to 430 BCE taking to Ancient Greece while in its Glory 2500 years ago, where the Fathers of many fields were born amidst the iconic wars between Sparta and Athens. With a lot of famous people including Leonidas, Pericles, Hippocrates, Socrates.. The game never ceases to provide depth to whatever it offers, not just the main story but also every single side quest, you will always find yourself dazzled and totally immersed in the game. The huge 256 - 260 sq.km Map of ancient Greece has everything to offer in its own glory and each location you visit, welcomes you with a unique twist of culture and you can literally feel the satisfaction your heart gets when you visit them. Now why this happens might be due to the fact that every structure in the game is totally true to the real structures found in modern Greece. The Temples, Arenas, Theatres, The seas, vegitation, fauna, mountains, districts, cities, villages, forts, etc. are all very true to reality.

Now, to talk about the features of the game... so we have a BIG AF Map with sufficient Water for you to travel on your Ship, yes you get a Ship like in AC4 BF to fight and salvage other ships, and many islands and vast lands to conquer and explore with all the structures true to real life Greece back in 430 BC. The missions are very immersive. I played as Alexios to keep that original Assassin's Creed Vibe going on and spent around 77 hours in the game at the time I wrote this review, of which, around 50-55 hours were spent on the story which explains how big the game quite is. There is a hige list of around 50 "Cultists" who are also targets and you must kill them. Some of them are encountered via main story quests while others are found via side quests and some are discovered by acquiring clues to their hideouts and whereabouts.
The level up system is well built and you can level up by grinding on with many side quests and bounties. You are basically a mercenary (Misthios) who can fight alongside Sparta or Athens and that's a choice you can make that won't actually affect the main story. BUT, The choices you make are certainly gonna decide the fate of the story. And many such choices, are to be made with precise decisions. Wrong choices can end up killing certain main characters and the story progression might go sideways or other ways.. As you go through the quests(main, side, bounties, exploration), you unlock various weapons and a lot of Legendary weapons, armors and such customizable equipments which can all be upgraded to the highest level you are on with certain looted resources and this gives you the option to make your character look as you like them to. Along with this is the ABILITIES, there are certain abilities that can be used for combat on the press of a button. For your archery, you can use up to 4 abilities among many you unlock and for melee you can use up to 8 abilities among the many you unlock and each can be leveled up to 3 levels of power and maxing it all out and using them in combat, changes the whole combat mode and makes you feel like you are the one man army. The enemies can be less forgiving and you surround yourself with too many of them, you might not be able to make it out alive.

I guess that should summarize the game and to know how the Heavenly world of Greece has been cinstructed in game, you can check out my profile for screenshots I have captured using the in game photo mode. Totally Recommend this game and I value it 10/10. The game definitely deserves Game of the Year for its wonderful and magnificent build, and also the Optimization is very good, performs well on most machines without taking up much juice. So stop Stopping and head over to the store and buy the game. There's absolutely no regret. It is super safe to say this game is one of the best in terms of everything that the Assassin's Creed Franchise has ever built.

This is the first Assassin's Creed game I've played, so I knew little about the story arc of previous entries, the mix of modern tech and historical storytelling, or of the RPG-style changes this game has had over the earlier ones. All I know is it sucked up a lot of my time and I'd happily revisit it all over again. It really is incredible stuff.

I came into this game off the back of Witcher 3, which obviously has many similarities, but which I didn't even enjoy half as much as Odyssey. It helped that I'm a big fan of ancient Greek history - and if that's you as well, get into this game on the strength of exploration mode alone.

The level progression feels neatly organic, and your skills and the world available to you expands smoothly in line with your familiarity with the controls and mechanics of the game. Hunter, Assassin and Warrior upgrades all felt like they were making a solid difference to my fighting style during combat. And combat isn't a button-mashing borefest - sure, you'll be doing a lot of dashing, but combined with parrying, attacking and pulling out some superpower moves, every fight was really enjoyable.

The story is fantastic; a blend of true history and fantasy, with everyone from Pericles to the Minotaur making an appearance. Some of the cutscenes were a little corny, but this is nitpicking compared to the more sophisticated elements of storytelling. The map is huge - dauntingly huge; I clocked up 168 hours and there are still islands I have to visit. The weapons, armour, clothing, ship upgrades and other perks all have meaningful input into the way you play the game.

And oh ... it's gorgeous. From a purely aesthetic perspective, this game is astounding. From white sand beaches to volcanic islands to bustling agoras, every pixel is lovingly rendered. I could just sit back and watch a bunch of Ikaros cinematics one after the other.

Totally immersive, engrossing and challenging, this is a game I'll head back to more than once.

This was a hard 6.9/10

Pros:
-Beautiful graphics displaying the colorful culture of ancient Greece
-Combat is fun
-It like the AC4 of the current gen line (because you actually have a ship complete with naval combat)
-You get to control an Eagle like in origins.
-The proto-Templars (Cult of Cosmos) were a interesting group.

Cons:
-The huge map is a big plus, but there's no incentive to explore it beside side-quests.
-Occasional glitches but not too big to impact performance.
-A ridiculous paywall
-The time it takes to complete it is way too long. I wouldn't mind it if the game was interesting enough.
-The story is meh.
-It doesn't feel like an "Assassin's Creed" game
________________________________
This is one of those games you sort of.... "own."
You've played it to completion and then forget about it. It sits idle in your game library never to be touched again.
Was it a bad game? no. Was it a good game? no. Do you remember what happens in the game? sorta.
Sure it was a little fun, but nothing too memorable. It wasn't bad either, it was just... "ok."
This is one of those games. The "Oh yeah, I forgot I have this one" game.

Time will tell if Valhalla impresses me, or becomes another one.

A really beautiful game... There are endless possibilities and jobs to do if you like to, many many hours playtime. It is totally versatile- if you want to go fight pirates on your ship, rob some robbers ( ! :D ) or just horsebackriding around, enjoing the story or feel the athmosphere. ヽ(♡‿♡)ノ

The landscape with all it's plants and the animals, the sea and the beaches, is worth hundreds of screenshots!
I sometimes feel like someone that is making a trip in the forest to make some photos.
In the meantime, I've spent hours riding around with my horses, as there are such beautiful places everywhere.
I absolutely recommend this game~ ( ◡‿◡ *)

This game was fun for probably the first 10 hours of playtime mainly because that is the time were you will be learning all the mechanics and doing your first few raids on forts/leader houses. Then after that 10 hour mark its basically repeating the same stuff for the rest of the game. Nothing to find while exploring really or even a reason to explore. I found myself just making B lines for objectives instead of wanting to look around and take my time. All in all... Just a very poor made open world RPG. They went with quantity of map size over quality with this one. Very disappointing as i used to love the old AC games and this was the first one I've bought since AC2. Will not be buying another AC game after seeing what this game had to offer. BTW they make leveling ridiculous unless you want to use their micro-transactions and buy the double xp and double money purchases which should have been a red flag but i was hoping the story would be worth the extra money. The last 40hrs of me playing this game was me telling myself that "maybe something cool is coming up" or "maybe its going to get interesting" but it never did. Don't waste your money.

This was one of the greatest gaming experiences of my life. I hadn't played an AC game since Black Flag, and this was better. I hadn't had a gaming experience cause me so much joy since Witcher 3, and this was on the same level. The mechanics are very different from the earlier AC games, but in my opinion they were perfect. Fantastic game. Even at full price it is entirely worth the price if you are a fan of this style of game. Can not recommend this enough.

Pretty fun game with awesome graphics and terrain. The only issue I have with the game is repetitive combat zones. Basically most areas are either kill # captains, loot # chest, free # captives. Combat is fun and interactive, late game it gets a little boring with some abilities and engravings just being BUSTED. Story is pretty boring in comparison to other versions of the game.

7/10 Gameplay

4/10 Story

Assassin's Creed® Odyssey: Where the hell is my hidden blade?!

Let me answer that question right off the bat. You will not have a hidden blade at any point in this game. Why? Because the only one who had it at this point was Darius. But let's roll back a bit. Many times you might be hearing people that this latest installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise is not really an Assassin's Creed game. That really depends on the point of view that you take. Yes, you do not have typical robes and iconic hidden blade in this game. But on the other hand, if you are a fan of the series, this latest game will give you more insight into the lore behind the never-ending conflict between assassins and templars. If Assassin's Creed Origins was about the origins of the assassin brotherhood, Odyssey is about the origins of the overall conflict.

The next destination for the Assassin's Creed is Ancient Greece during Peloponessian War. Player gets thrown right into action with Battle of Thermopylae, taking control of none other than spartan king Leonidas, bearing yet another Piece of Eden, this time Spear of Leonidas. After this action packed tutorial setpiece is finished, player can give into the true bones and meat of this game. Right off the bat, player is faced with choice between two characters, Alexios and Kassandra, who are both grandchildren of the famed Leonidas. Kassandra is the canonical main character, however for the sake of the review, term misthios will be used as it is used throughout the game to avoid general confusion as to who the main character is.

With the choice made, player gets placed on misthios's home island of Kephallonia. Everything starts nice and calm, everyone being full of humour and just overall happy with their life, which in typical Assassin's Creed fashion does not stay true for very long and everything goes horribly wrong. And so our misthios has to embark on an epic quest to stop an evil cult, find his father, reunite his family and many other things, which get revealed as player slowly explores the main story as well as the never-ending barrage of sidequests and side content, all accompanied by an amazing soundtrack, which when it comes to Assassin's Creed, never fails to deliver.

Every good heo, in our case misthios , needs a decent combat to make his epic quest feel truly epic. Does the game deliver in this aspect? Well, yes and no. You have everything that Origins had. Basic attacks, parry, dodge roll and special attacks, which have been changed to supernatural attacks and moves, powered by the Spear of Leonidas. And thus for the first time in the Assassin's Creed franchise (let's forget Tyranny of King Washington DLC in ACIII), player will be able to create shockwaves around him to push enemies away, become invisible, set everyone on fire, rush through enemies and many others. This combat is supported by a skill tree, consisting by three sections, that being bow, direct combat and stealth mixed with passive effects such as poison or fire. This skill tree a bit of an improvement from Origins, however the crux of it comes that you will often find yourself not using most of it as you will find that one insanely broken combination and you will never bat an eye at any of the other options. Moreover, some of the combinations are so overpowered, you will not feel challenged by any kind of combat encounter you will meet. Another issue is that with the expansion of the combat system, the most staple product of the franchise suffered. And that is parkour. It has devolved only into climbing up and down, occassionally doing a leap of faith from a high place. So if you wanted your realistic parkour fix with fluid moveset and fun tricks, unfortunately, that is not happening here.

On topic of meeting, I mentioned beforehand enormous amounts of side content. As Ancient Greece was located in the Mediterranean Sea, player will get to explore different islands, almost all of them filled with something to do, be it quests, famed viewpoints, collectibles or optional bossfight. Considering side quests, direct comparison to Witcher 3 must be drawn, as it is almost impossible to miss the inspiration behind how the quests are structured. You will meet a person who will give you a quest, you will do some part of the quest and in 3/4 of cases you will be faced with some sort of choice. The major difference between how Witcher 3 and Odyssey does its quests is that in Odyssey you will feel like whatever choice yuo made had no impact whatsoever on anything happening in the world. Except for a few better developed quests, most of the side stories in Odyssey will feel like placeholder for experience and rewards with no other value whatsoever.

So you might be wondering: How the hell do you travel between this islands? The answer is very simple, but also a bit horrifying. Player gets a ship. Honestly speaking, I wish we would not be given a ship at all. First of all, it breaks a historical immersion as ships were not as promiment as they make them be in this game, however that is a minor detail. The bigger issue comes with two different things. Firstly, ship combat feels nothing like the combat in Assassin's Creed Black Flag . It is hard to desribe it properly, but the feeling is overall off, almost like they only took combat of Black Flag and sped it up and removed the fun sea shanties. Second issue are the ship upgrades which at the end of the date are there only to prolong the gameplay as the high level upgrades are an endless grind for resources, which will discourage you from achieving max level. Only redeeming thing about ships in this game, is that you can recruit lieutanants, which add different passive bonuses to your ship, giving you that good old Brotherhood feeling back.

Unfortunately, that ship will be used to reach important story elements, which is the final point. Story is, blantly put, okay. It is not as well written and directed as Origins as some parts of the game feel unnecessary and plain out boring, serving almost no purpose whatsoever. The story of our dear misthios is once supported by a web of cultists, which the player has to assassinate as they navigate the islands of Ancient Greece. And honestly, that was the most fun part of the game. Going through these targets, figuring out how to kill them in the most efficient way. This web is also more extensive than in Origins, giving you more targets to practice your comabt and sneaking skills at. However, the story of Odyssey has one major issues. As you play through the game, one thing starts to become more apparent. Do you sometimes wake up and have that super dry feelinging in your mouth and you are just like "This is super meh" and so you go for that delicious content called water. Well the story in Odyssey and mainly with its conclusion is that dry mouth except without water to make it go away.

Overall, I do recommend this game. It is fun to explore all of these islands you read about in the historical books, meet all these important characters and fight endless waves of enemies with your new supernatural abilities. This applies twice for Assassin's Creed fans who will get more insight into why the conflict is still ongoing, why it started and where the true "Odyssey" of the Assassin Brotherhood began.

Should you play this game?

We work in the dark to serve the light. And I want to give you that light with three simple questions:
1. Are you an Asssassin's Creed fan?
2. Do you want a solid RPG set in Ancient Greece?
3. Do you want more Witcher-like games?

If you answered YES to any of thsoe questions, strap on your misthios badge and slip into the origins of the centuries long struggle.

That is a one massive game. Odyssey now fully consists of RPG elements: a leveling system, talent trees, and dialog options which may affect cutscenes or the ending. You also will opt to choose either Alexios or Kassandra as the main character of your adventure.

Exploration has never been so amazing in this game series. I was so delighted and mesmerized as I explore the world of Greece in this game. Synchronizing viewpoints was one of my favorite activities. Moreover, you will see various "Historical Locations" which I believe might be real places all over Greece. The world design is so complex, every place is pretty much unique - That's what makes it so beautiful.
Like Origins, this world of Odyssey also consists of various tombs (but of course not Pyramids in this one), and after completing it, you will obtain an ability point.

The new combat system has been revised, which makes it even more complex: Each tree grants you various active abilities where you can assign and then use it during a fight. You now collect every piece of gear (head, chest, hands, legs, feet, bow, weapon) and either replace the old ones by new ones, or upgrade by a blacksmith. Compared to Origins, you were gathering materials to upgrade weapon / bow damage. You still have to gather materials to upgrade your gears when going to the blacksmith. Also a new feature called "engraving" whereby you choose to add some additional stats to one of your piece of equipment according to your style of play.

The Naval system is now a crucial part in your journey in the huge world. You will require materials as well to upgrade your ship. You can now add a Lieutenant to your ship, where each will add a beneficial stat to your ship. You get one additional Lieutenant as you upgrade the hull of your ship - up to 4. Whenever you are boarding an enemy ship, those Lieutenants of yours will be helpful, as they will aid you into battle.

Assassination isn't that simple now in this one. You will probably struggle going full stealth if you do not upgrade various Assassination skills in your tree as your Assassination's base damage sometimes might not be enough to 1-hit brutes or captains, or other high-ranked officers. The game is therefore telling you to be smart when choosing your talents...

Music was also one of the big strengths of this game in the series. It really puts you in the mood whenever you are fighting as a spartan. You will also have a lot of emotional moments at some point in time, and the music really plays a big part in that, which makes your adventure even more memorable.

As you progress through the story, there will be many Assassination targets that you will have to kill. As you kill some of them, you will get a clue which will lead you to the next target. Therefore, you will have to dig your way a lot, until you reach to the final target.

I'd say that this game in the series was a pretty big change, and Ubisoft still has room for progression, especially in enhancing the RPG elements. But to this day, this is one of the most impressive games I've played in terms of exploration. It's definitely worth playing, with full of excitement and worth playing again maybe on harder difficulties for new challenges.

I havent felt any need to 'buy' items or timesavers.
I've played Runescape... you think I need time savers ... this is a light grind.

Now, that aside , I bought the Gold Edition , and It is worth every penny.
Deluxe is pretty trash - which means Ultimate is trash.

Gold or standard if you are going to buy.

Game is awesome.
Ultra settings are ULTRA for a reason, there is little difference / no difference between Ultra and very high in most cases , so don't cuck yourself out of frame rate for the sake of 'Maxed settings' , be smart.

This game is beautiful. I could just get lost running around and looking at scenery. It's been a while since I am this impressed with a AC game.

They changed a lot and this change is a good change. It has naval battle and ship management from black sails. And choices and dialogs and side quests feel like you are in a witcher game. Although choices are not as complex as witcher.. still a nice add and I hear it impact the story outcome.
Fighting could be better.. parry system and timing is not right and few assassination animations are not right too. But that Sparta kick never gets old. Oh yeah they have talent tree and you can pick abilities when you level up.
I will update the review when I am done with the full main story mission. But 20 hrs in ..this game is absolute blast. Will recommend this game at full price for anyone who like games like witcher , shadow of mordor, black flags .
Cheers,
Have a nice day.

Edit: after all these hours i am still loving this game.. has lot of updates and content almost every week.

In short:
If you haven't played AC:Origins, don't read further and go play AC:Origins.
If you played AC:Origins, and did not like it, or liked it just for Bayek, don't play this.
If you played AC:Origins, and liked everything about it, play this.

If you are still not convinced, you can read the rest.

Actually, I am quite disappointed with this game - not because it is bad, but because it could be so much better.
The main differences with AC:Origins are:
- Obviously, the country. It's hard to say whether Ancient Greece or Ancient Egypt is better; both are done well. I don't think there is a better depiction of Ancient Greece in video games or in media, for that matter.
- Unlikable main protagonist. Well, maybe likable to some. You are playing as a person of a sex of your choice (I suggest to play as Kassandra), that only cares about money and finding members of his/her family. The game is set during the war between Athens and Sparta, and your daily routine will include weakening one side of the war (by destroying food, stealing money and killing their commanders) so that the other side can attempt to capture the region and will hire you to fight for them. Other activities can include killing innocent people for money because they had business/personal disagreement with your employer, or murdering chicken on a farm just because. Basically, it's an Assassin's Creed without the Creed. It is quite fitting that "CREED" on the logo is smaller than the other words, but it shouldn't be there at all.
- The gameplay is more RPG-like than ever before in the series. However, many elements are either confusing or hard to manage. The inventory / quest management is pretty bad: there are absolutely no sorting options in the inventory, which has a cap ~650 with storage; and poor sorting options in quest log, which can easily reach 50-100 quests. There are choices in dialogues, but they are (with very few exceptions, mostly counter-intuitive) inconsequential. So, good ideas, poor execution in this department.
- Introduced save system. This was a good move.
- Music is worse, in my opinion. But that's just my opinion.
- Naval battles are back, pretty similar to AC4:Black Flag, but probably a bit worse, Not my kind of thing, so I won't talk much about it.

If you are still reading, here is some rant about bad things that remain the same:
- The game is pretty heavy on resources (and together with the game you will need to run Steam, Uplay and Denuvo).
- Ubisoft does not fix bugs, even the most annoying and easy to fix ones (for proof, just google "please move Herodotus to a different spot"; spoiler: he is still there). Also, as with their older games, in couple years you can expect no support at all.

Why this is an important Assassin's Creed game.

Even after people have finished the story of Odyssey I still see people say its a game for RPG fans but not AC fans..... Yes it's great Game for RPG Fans.. But more importantly this is a major game for Assassin's creed fans.

I've loved every single Assassin's Creed game that has released so far, I've read a few of the novels and Will be moving onto the graphic novels too. So now I sound like a fanboy and well I guess I am..

I was not looking forward to Odyssey, As a fan of playing as an assassin I was annoyed that It was being set before Origins and wanted to move on with Bayek or at least See more of the Creed. from what the trailers had shown I did not see this as a Assassin's creed game at all.

Alexios/kassandra's story will take you down a story that can change everything you think you know about the world in the lore of Assassin's creed. The First Civilization are a heavy focus in odyssey.

The Assassin's and Templars are at war and always have been, The race to find pieces of Eden is always the top priority for both sides, that's why one of the reasons we use the Animus is to find the locations of the Pieces of Eden.

Layla Has discovered a Mercenary who's story sets them on an amazing adventure that ties them into the being one of the most important people to discover some of the Pieces, There's a reason why Odyssey has Mythical Creatures that have been created by the first Civilization to guard the Pieces that you will come across.

We won't always need to follow assassin's to uncover more about the First Civilization, We've seen in past games that many people have come across the Pieces and have used them... People like Gandhi, Napoleon, Alexander the Great and many more including the Sages that existed.

This is a great Assassin's creed game and I can't wait too see where it goes next and to what kind of person we will follow, I have a lot of hours in this game not because its the best game but because it has so much content, and that's not saying its a bad game but I have my own Favorite AC game.

100% must own for all Assassin's creed fans!

My Negatives

I've only had one bug in this game and that's an achievement not unlocking for me (Due to be fixed) the other issue I have with the game that you will have too is that civilians and slaves attack you when you get into fights with guards, I was clearing a Marble Quarry that had slaves and I was saving them yet they attacked me.... Its immersion breaking.... It don't happen everytime and more often than not its when you accidently hit them in a fight that they are to close to.

So some Pros:
-Great Graphics
-Fluid Combat
-Interesting and Engaging Quests (Although nothing that is game changing)

Some Cons:
-Bad Story , like I think this may be worse than 3.
-Bad voice acting.
-Stealth like an Assassin is not really the main focus on the hardest difficulty.

I will point out though that something about 100 percenting this game made me feel satisfied and I was very pleased with the pacing of content.


(My Favorite Side Quest)
An NPC was locked in a cage. He told me he locked himself in there because a prophecy told him if he acquired a certain sword and shield he would murder his parents. His parents were there and they said the male black smith had the shield and a bandit woman had the sword. I went and murdered the bandit woman and the sweet talked the male blacksmith and had sex with him. I then returned and let the caged man know he was safe to leave because I acquired the sword and shield and disposed of it. The "parents" then told him he was adopted and the real parents were the bandit woman and the blacksmith. Long story short I went on a quest and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the NPCs Dad and killed his Mom. 10/10 would recommend.

No.

Pros:

- Insanely beautiful. Seriously, as someone who values good visuals, there wasn't much to criticise. Fires had a weird red shine though. Coming from Origins, it also felt like a visual downgrade to me. I used Reshade to desaturate the game a bit, that helped.

- Kassandra really grew on me. A lot of the dialogue made me cringe or roll my eyes, but she was refreshing as a character.

- About 70% of the gameplay consists of mindlessly running around, clearing out enemy camps and it was so boring that my brain went off to other worlds. It was weirdly relaxing and productive to explore while brainstorming ideas for a story I was working on and murder various enemies in the background. Kind of a bad sign for a single player game though, if it's so boring that you need to occupy your brain with something else while playing.

- The Atlantis DLC was okay. Quite funny at times.

- It made me want to play Origins again. I love that game.

Cons:

- This is not an Assassin's Creed game. It's a meme-around-in-Ancient-Greece game with no interest in a grounded, historical setting whatsoever. Or in Assassin's Creed.

- The story is so boring, bland, and predictable that I missed Syndicate. Yes, Syndicate. After playing Origins, I had high expectations and Odyssey delivered on absolutely none of them.

- Everything was too long. The quest chains were too long, the DLC was too long, the levelling was too long. Oh hey, I completed one quest objective. Time for another bunch of extra requirements and two new fetch quests on the other side of the map.

- The bloat has gone beyond what I had thought possible. Prepare yourself for hundreds of fetch or kill-ten-of-this-type quests with generic, recycled dialogue. Wanna skip them? Better whip out your wallet and buy the XP booster, lol.

- The Legacy of the First Blade DLC was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke. I did not consent to this.

- Microtransactions in a single player game. Screw you, Ubisoft.

---

Origins made me cautiously optimistic about this new open world RPG spin on Assassin's Creed (although I still prefer the old games). Odyssey made sure to copy everything except for the good bits from Origins and implemented a grind fest instead.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is indeed a wicked journey. I've always loved Greek mythology, so buying this game was a no brainer for me. Ubisoft has managed to improve and refine the gameplay even more since Origins, allowing you to create builds and truly tailor the game to the way you want to play it. If you liked Origins, or just simply love Ancient Greece lore, then this is definitely the Odyssey for you.

This is a particularly hard game for me to review, i LOVE Assassin's Creed deeply - but Assassin's Creed Oddysey isn't an Assassin's Creed game its something else.

But is it good? Thats a difficut question to answer again i LOVE Assassin's Creed so to begin with i hated this game, i hated pretty much everything about it. I hated it so much that initially i stopped playing it and if i had posted a review then i would have given it a thumbs down.

but now after completing the main campaign and seeing most of the map? i'm willing to just about give it a pass. i spent 60+ hours playing it so obviously i liked something about it.

The story is pretty bad infact when it ends you're not quite sure if it actually has ended. it doesn't resolve itself in any satisfying way doesn't even run credits just drops you straight back in the world so it doesn't really feel like an ending. I understand why they did this but it left me completely unfulfilled and i hope this is addressed in Valhalla.

Characters, the characters are overwhelmingly just kind of meh. Kasandra is the stand out protagonist her voice actor is much better and sounds more natural plus she is the canon way through the story. Phoibe is a nice character but felt like she should have had more character development. The new modern day protagonist Layla is actually pretty decent we need to see alot more character developer for her which seems to be promised in valhalla.

Gameplay is mostly fun. i liked the combat but the traversal is more autopilot then ever before i don't hate it but i also don't feel great doing it. The combat is fun BUT this is also why it's not Assassin's Creed by far the best method of playing is to dump everything into Warrior and run into camps and killing everyone. Stealth has been badly nerfed and is therefore not worth doing.

This game is EXTREMELY grindy if you like that kind of game then you'll be fine for me i hate grinding in most things so i felt compelled to purchase the exp boost from the shop after which the game felt a million times better to play for me.

Finally i HATE level scaling it just means that i level up my character but i don't feel like i've really improved which is a real shame for me, there are arguments both sides for level scaling i fall on the side of WHY?!

In Conclusion Oddysey is a BAD Assassin's Creed game, probably the worst in the series, but it is an enjoyable video game that has plenty of content to keep people busy.

Not enough Assassins Creed stuff to make it a good AC game.

Not enough RPG stuff to make it a good RPG game.

Pretty mediocre story that gets very bad near the end with a lot of loose ends. The gameplay area is absolutely massive, but staring at mountains and taking out the same 5-6 forts quickly loses its fun. The nemesis system is fun at the start but it gets boring pretty fast once you've done it a couple times, enemies just don't vary in meaningful ways even though they all get their own names, loadouts and looks.

A lot of features feel tacked on as an afterthought and the main features didn't excite me enough personally.

Kasandra's pretty cute though.

Probably AC Odyssey is the best AC games I ever played from the whole series.

Pros:
- Great character design
- Great and little sad story line
- So many quests in this game
- Awesome graphic design
- World of Greece is really magnificent and beautiful
- It does support in game photo mode
- Entire game play is very lengthy, really
- Battle and combat is very challenging and hardcore, I used to enjoy it as I did play dark souls and Nioh before

Cons:
- Optimization performance is very bad
- Some of graphic settings could hit the system performance, cause the entire gameplay laggy even if you owned gtx10 series gpu and at least ram 8gb (my laptops specs: GTX1050 VRAM 4GB, RAM8GB, Processor intel core i-7).

To sum up, I would recommend you to buy Gold Edition and you will enjoy it a lot. Season pass has included 2 major expansions and AC3 remastered, the 2 major expansions of this game are even more lengthy than that of AC Origins.

The game is beautiful and really enjoyed the story up to meeting family members .... but now just seems excessive grinding with no sense of direction of what next ..... and the auto scaling is completely broke!! I leave an area because is is obviously at level 29 and I am at 26 (even the simple shielded warriors are much harder) ... I come back later when level up and everyone there has leveled up above me again.... even the simple dogs all over the map are scaling with me... what is even the point of grinding to move up, if everyone moves with you (did a socialist touch the scaling feature-joke). My interest in the game is dropping off fast, tired of grinding to find common soldiers that are at my level, when I am supposed to be the superior fighter;I should be many levels above the base common fighter by now. And many of the quest you are supposed to follow in story keep ramping up in level required... and many task of collecting things (key to moving forward after meet key person in key city) don't even show up on map .... you give me 4 very large regions to search with no highlighted areas. The first 30 hours were fun ... but now just grinding and boring.... just add a scaling function in the options section (not difficulty but scaling)... the fix is easy, but instead they want you to pay more to essential have the game work properly - scam!

world is big, yet dead at the same time if that makes sense. 7/10

Assassins Creed + The Witcher 3 = Best in the series.

Best played on Hard and exploration mode. Reduce HUD to the minimum for better immersion.

Edit: Seems I found a way around the game not launching because of a error connecting to the ubisoft ap to sychronize the game.

Pretty enjoyable game. Huge and detailed open world.
Ancient Greece is such a thing of beauty.
Graphics and World Building: Great
Story and quests: Decent
PRO TIP: Buy the standard edition as the season pass and DLCs are not too good. Also Gold edition just gives stuff that's cool and relevant for the first 2 hours of the game. After that those items are useless, instead get the free items from ubi-connect rewards.

Let me just start by saying that I have not beat Assassins creed Odyssey and I do not plan on it anytime soon. This is more of a chore than it is a game. Does that mean that I did not have fun with it? No, I did have moments of fun and the gameplay is (sometimes) good, but the flaws and overall game just squeezes all the fun out of the game. Let me start with why I stopped playing ACO. The levelling system and constant need to grind already annoyed me a ton, yet it had not tipped me over the edge just yet until I finished chapter 6. Without spoiling it, you find a certain location and are then sent out to find 4 different items. The level to get this was level 28 I believe, this seemed a bit tedious and like it would go any where so I opened my quest log to select a mission that would progress the story only to find that the next story mission is level 35. At this point I was level 27, and the previous missions were around my level, so it truly annoyed me to see Ubisoft pull this filler nonsense and force me to grind. Its scummy tactics to try and get you to buy the XP increaser. This would not be an issue if all the side events in the game were the same thing over and over again and if the side missions were actually interesting and done well. I can remember about 2 side missions in my time playing.
Now this isn’t the only issue with the game, Alexios and a lot of the other characters have horrible voice acting, Alexios/Kassandra as characters are completely inconsistent and have no clear personality or characters traits. “That’s the point, its your Odyssey” I hear someone cry, no, that’s not the point. When you’re given a set character in an RPG (Like Geralt from The Witcher) you need to establish that characters traits and goals, when you have an unclear middle ground like this game, it doesn’t work at all. You can kill an entire village yet still be the good guy in the end. Furthermore, there is the bounty system which you get for seemingly no reason be increased by killing innocents. That’s not a penalty for killing civilians, that’s just a pseudo punishment cause they don’t know how to make an actual meaningful RPG with consequences and consistency, they are damage spongy annoying enemies who even break the game at points. I had multiple times when I was doing a main mission and a bounty hunter would just walk into the area and break it completely.
The map is way too big, I got near the end of the game and have not even seen half the map at this point. The size would be warranted if it had fun things to do but since its Odyssey, it has to be the most mind numbingly boring repetitive stuff on the planet. Ubisoft do the bare minimum with this game and it shows. The missions are tedious as well. A lot of them are just the same as the side activities, when you have trouble telling the main missions and side events apart, then you know you have an issue. The main missions are supposed to be fun and inventive, giving the player unique opportunities, but a lot of them just turn out to be "go here and steal this thing or kill this guy."
I don’t want to hate ACO, Assassins creed is a franchise that I love(d) and I don’t want to see it in such a horrible state, but its clear that they aren’t really trying anymore, they are leaving behind lore and the old AC to try and grab a bigger audience, not caring if they annoy or anger fans. Assassins creed used to be my favourite franchise, I remember the days where I would actually be excited to hear that a new Assassins creed was being released. It had a story that I care about, characters I care about and the science fiction lore about an elder civilisation and inventive technology.
To say that I don't care about this franchise anymore wouldnt be true, but I have lost nearly all my interest because it is clear that Ubisoft also have. Their disregard for lore and the story of their own franchise is mind blowing to me. I still love what I had with the original games, yet this isn't Assassin's creed.

Short: OMFG just play it already. Sooooo awesome!! AV: 0,56

Long: Yes, I am an Assassin's Creed fan since the beginning of time. ♥♥♥♥ you not. And I have been with Ubisoft also through hell (#ACUnity). But man the last two parts (Origin & Odyssey) are just amazing. The graphics, the different parts of nature and the LOVE FOR DETAILS are incredible.
I cought myself many times just noticing how great the many NPCs are doing their little tiny tasks. And how many different tasks those are, from fishing to makings pots, sewing, harvesting, forging.. omg too many actually to remember. I could just pick one out of my head and I am sure it's in the game.
Story itself is as neat as I would like it to be. Even though I wish there would be "choice matters" quests, where you really change the whole outcome of the game. Well there have been few quets like this, but the outcome was still too subtle. Maybe some stronger changes would have a better wow-effect on me.
An other point which I love is the discovery mode, where you can learn (with a guide) historical details about culture, people and architecture of that time period. It's just great how well researched it is and I wish my history lessons in school would be with this game. Would porbably become Indiana Jones.
Last point is playtime. To play the game through with all main & side quests and also with uncovering all the map and visiting all special points of interest it took me around 160 hours. and additionally to it around 20 hours for the discovery mode. All in all 180 hours. I bought the gold edition becasue I wanted to have all DLCs right from the beginning - even though I hate that DLCs even exist. What was for me most important is the fact that I pay less than 1€ per hour played. Means If I buy a game for 60€ I expect the gameplay to last at least 60 hours. In my case I actually hope the game to last 80 hours but would not be too angry if it just takes me to play somewhere between 60 to 80 hours. I call it the AckermanValue. If you buy a game for 20€ and you play just 8 hours, then your Ackerman value is just 20/8=2,5. If you buy ACO GE for 100€ and you play 180 hours than you have a AckermanValue of 0,56 which is preeeeetty neat!!! You should always try to have an AckermanValue of not more than 0,8!! And yes it might differ, when the experience of playing changes your opinion. Positive Experience is affecting the AckermanValue and is called the AdvancedAckermanValue (AAV). Developers can hardly predict the general AAV which is why they should focus on a nice AV. I think I made my point clear enough here.

Back to the game - just buy it already and stop reading reviews. You are most likely going to enjoy it!!

A bit buggy, but sometimes those bug makes me laugh and didnt feel annoyed. The combat system is kinda dull at hard or nightmare mode, challenging player to fight more than one person. Horses are kinda sucks to climb steep mountain, prefer to walk and enjoying the environment. Naval battle are awesome, with upgradeable ship parts but finding the materials are kinda hard. Alpha animals are deadly and challenging to fight. Gain xp are kinda slower because Ubisoft want us to purchase microtransaction inside the game. The story are amazing, best one so far since it was greek mythology. Spartan spear instead of hidden blade are more realistic for being an assassin. 8.5/10

Remember when the game devs put effort into fun, challenging climbing routes?
Remember when Assassin's Creed has buildings instead of featureless rocks and cliffs?
Remember when they put effort into developing a compelling plot, with characters you don't forget about 2 minutes after the leave?
Remember the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hidden blade?
Remember when you fought people and establishments instead of monsters and gods?
Remember when these games were fun? Before Origins?
Remember when they would at least kind try to make a new game instead of just reskinning the last one? At least Rouge's plot was distinguishable from Black Flag's.

Great game so far, adding choices into AC really makes it shine.

However, they still seem opposed to lending those choices historic meaning.
So don't think you can change the outcome of the Peloponesian war with those battles - they do nothing but add exp.

Many great historical games, such as Paradox or TW titles, is build on history as a base with the posibility to change the outcome as key part of the experience (like rebuilding the Roman Empire... again). This could have been great to see in this game - the ability to change history to lend depth and weigth to your ingame choices (it sure wouldn't work with AC lore or the hardcore fans of that, but man, what an amazing rpg it would be - especially for us history nerds that prefer to skip the AC lore and just enjoy the historical setting).

Anyway, this title is still my favorite for other reasons: massive world, interesting quests, fair characters, and overall just content that has both breadth and depth. I'm just thankful this title hit me while I had some time off.

Very much recommened if you have the specs - but be very sure to check this.

Honestly, this review is for seasoned Assassin's Creed vets. If you've spent hundreds of hours checking boxes, looting collectibles, and massacring guards, then I just don't see this game adding much - even with the revamped combat.

If you're not one of those players, you may just enjoy it. Heck, you might even if you have dumped untold amounts of time into the series. But Odyssey largely keeps the AC status quo of forgettable stories, bland characters and repititious tasks that prior games started.

After 40 hours with no end in sight i gave up. It felt very very repetitive and grindy. The map is so big yet so empty at the same time. I couldn't connect with any of the characters! The only good thing is the graphics it did look really beautiful in places of the map.

AC ORIGINS

Before I start I want to talk about AC Origins.
Ac Origins made me love egypt despite me hating egyptian culture and landscape. They made boring places like deserts and pyramits so much fun to wonder around. Quests Dlcs and content itself was goodly balanced in Origins and I got over 100 hours in Origins.( I played every assassins creed game except chronicles)



ASSASSIN'S CREED ODYSSEY a flawed Masterpiece:

Timeline, places, Content:

Odyssey is set on Peloponnesian war Era of Ancient Greece and I love that timeline and its Mythology. This is a perfect setting for me to play in. Story in my opinion was better than Origins due to all that family stuff. Also characters and people we interact are so much fun and relatible than boring Egyptians. On the other hand I loved greek architecture and cities. World is so colorful and every city looks different.Cities are full of temples of Greek gods and their statues. Outside sities are even more beautiful to look at. There are
misty greedy forests, snowy mountains, volcanic islands, pink threes as well as Orange and brown forests. Map itself is so big I still have places I never went yet. I still did not played dlcs and lost tales of greece. I also did not killed all cultists. In the middle of the game I lost myself due to searching for cultists and those damn merceneries. I hate mercenery system.
There is always conflict and when you cause trouble merceneries came to hunt you. I remember countless times that I got killed by a mercenery when I cleared a camp. All my progress in that camp goes back to where I started because it does not save inside conflict areas. I also got killed by merceneries before I confirm kill cultist which also sucks. I think mercenery system is unnecessary. I always paid my bounties to keep me out from trouble when I started to get rich because it is the only thing in this game that bothered me so much.

Mythical Creatures:
In our journey to find seals we fight 4 mythical creatures:
Cyclops
Medusa
Sphinx
Minotaur
There was also another Cyclops I saw behind a temple which was not bound to seal quest line so I believe there is more Mythical beasts around. Dont worry this beasts are related to ISU so game keeps the realty.


WHAT A EXPERIENCE:

I compited in Olympics
I told stories of Perseus to little spartan kids
I slept with a cultist
I fought in Peloponnesian war
I killed Medusa
I met Sokrates and Hipokrates.
I killed beasts send by Apollo
I overthrew Kings
I sealed Atlantis
I walked in the land of gods

This game made me do things that I could not do in reallife.


Ship Warfare is back

It is the same old blackflag experience with some adjustments due to timeline.
There is a new cleaving mechanic thatI liked and I also liked finishing animations of throwing javalins which pierce through enemy crew in slow motion.

What is the Flaw of this game?

Simply Too much of everything. There is too much grind too much mateiral you need to loot too much quests and too much people to kill as cultists which made me tired of doing same stuff sometime. Because of the new stuff they added some other aspects does not look polised like Ac origins. For example Gladiator Arena looks like a joke in Odyssey. In origins there was 2 Arenas with all cutcenes and option to spare or kill. All of the Gladiators felt unique in Origins. In Odyssey it is here just to be in the game.
There is no animations or option to spare. Another example is skill three. There was different type of bows in Origins but in Odyssey there is only one bow you can use and you can use bow skills as diiferent bows. So Ubisoft just added bow mechanic as skill three and it is just pure laziness. also making skills level up rather than different skills is also not interesting. There so many unnessecery skills that I am sure nobody uses. Origins skill three were much better. Despite all that I liked the new use of adrenaline bar with being able to do more with combat abilities which was repetitieve in Origins.
Lets dont forget we can have sex with characters but it game does not show you everything like witcher 3 did which is also a bad impression.


FINAL CONCLUSION
Despite some repetitive and grindy stuff. I really enjoyed this game. I love the beauty of this game. This game is pure art in itself. New dialogue system is really good and makes you play more and more. Story is really interesting and keeps you going. Historical Figures are here as always and their quests are fun. Mythical Creatures are also a plus for me

My Score is 92/100

Buy gold edition in sale.
Gold edition gives you all of the DLCs plus AC 3 Remastered.

I can't recommend this game for various reasons. And I'll try to justify why I can't recommend this game.

- The story is pretty decent and the main quests are good but what holds it back is the progression system. So basically you have to be reach a certain level to attempt the main quest and to level up you have to do boring side quests which have no variety whatsoever and are basically of three types Fetch quests, Fort infiltrations and Assasination quests. It's fine at the beginning but it gets annoying at the latter stages of the game because of its repetitive nature. Another point I'd like to make is the voice acting, they're pretty bad and it feels like a significant downgrade from Origins. And Dialogues seem way too Cringey at times.

- Combat is decently satisfying to be honest. But enemies on the other hand are enemies are like sponges and can take lots of damage before going down and another thing you should be concerned about is the level of your armour and weapons because even if you fight an enemy of your level but you have lower level weapons it's like fighting with a toothpick as the enemy takes very little damage and you get killed pretty easily. And it's a chore to upgrade your because you need a fair amount of money and resources in order to upgrade and you don't get it easily. I personally believe it's an intentional design choice made by Ubisoft in order to make their Microtransactions more appealing. Microtransactions should not exist in single player games.

- Gameplay and graphics: There's a lot of exploration and the map is huge and pretty. But if you pay attention you'll sooner or later realize the lack of details compared to origins and the world is more or less a copy paste job as most of the areas other than landmarks like Athens and Sparta have no distinct features and mostly look the same. Another prominent feature I'd like to talk about is the naval combat. Its alright but the thing holding it back is the fact that it's a chore to upgrade the ship, you'll have to grind a fair bit to upgrade your ship and this is again an intentional design choice by Ubisoft to incentivize their boosters, resource packs and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ microtransactions. Another topic I'd like to touch is the optimization for this game, it is simply terrible. I have a fairly powerful pc and I had to spend some time to fiddle with the graphics settings to make it run at a consistent 60FPS.

I'll conclude by saying that this is a good game ruined by questionable design choices by Ubisoft. I usually dont write long reviews but I had to make an exception here.

If you like adventure RPGs, this is a must-have. The open world, discuss options, and the ability to change the look of your armor give you a lot of freedom to play as the character you want to play and to really immerse in the game.
I really loved playing this.

The haters are triggerad and biased; this game is nothing short of spectacular. Cannot praise the team enough for the sheer scale and complexity of the execution. As a bit of a greek geek I cannot express enough how well they weave real historical locations, figures, and events into the game narrative. The work effort must have been absolutely massive and I feel like it is worth every penny, maybe even more.

As far as the grind claims - Hitting level 33 now and not feeling any of the grind-walls described, nor do I feel any of the bugs. Not seeing a need for DLC or MTX to make the game fun, so not sure what these kids are complaininag about. With that being said, I am so damned impressed with the execution fo this game and how much fun it has been, that I am going to do something I rarely do and actually buy DLC and MTX to support the game even further. The kids are spoiled. Personally, I think these Ubi nailed it and they deserve to be rewarded for the hours I have enjoyed myself.

Good Job!

I desperately wanted to like this game and its frustrating to witness Ubisoft's lack of care. The story. the characters, your choices, none of it matters. You can have romances, which don't advance the plot, you get to make dialogue choices that don't make sense for the character, hell, you can kill an entire village, pay yopur bounty and still be the hero at the end of the day. The combat boils down to a bunch of button smashing and the epic bosses don't feel ~epic~. They're not clever, Ubisoft doesn't tap into the rich legends of greek myth to make the fights unique.

Medusa gets laser eyes and teleportation, Are you kidding me? You could've built a whole storyline around Medusa and how she's misunderstood, but no laser eyes apparently make more sense. Even worse is that you spend hours choppping at an endless lifebar, only to get nothing out of it.

And the level scaling good god the level scaling that you can't switch off. Why. WHY? You get to fight mercenaries and cultists who all have names but the only back story you get is the little post-it note in their corresponding menu. They don't matter to you or the story. It's trying to be Skyrim or The Witcher and it's not, I'm sorry.

It's a pretty game, I gotta give them that. It looks beautiful and I feel bad for the designers. Exploration mode is also a great addition. If its on sale, get it, play it till you reach the Kalydonian Boar and agree with me. Hope you enjoy fetch quests.

After about 10 hours I started to realise just how greedy Ubisoft is. The game started to really slow down and I was under-levelled for everything - I then realised that they're trying to sell 'time savers' to get more XP so I don't have to grind side-quests. Then as I tried to just level my gear rather than grind using in game currency, collectables etc. I realise that these TOO are sold as time-savers and that I couldn't even use the things I'd gathered in the game to keep up. The store is FLOODED with micro transactions, half of which actually spoil some of the story for me, as you can see so much of the good late game gear (or what I presume is late game gear and not store-only items). There is a good game here but ubisoft have designed the core game mechanics to be frustrating and time consuming so that they can sell YOU, the purchaser of the game, THINGS THAT MAKE THE GAME PLAY HOW IT SHOULD. This is such a poor customer experience and it undermines all the work of the talented people who made this game. The world is beautiful and I'd love to recommend to play it but I simply can't - the game has been gutted and put back together in order to sell you as many add-ons as possible, even going as far as to make the core story and gameplay UNPLAYABLE without hours of additional grinding OR reaching into your wallet again. It's a real shame.

After playing quite a bit, I can say I'm not a fan of this entry. I really enjoyed Origins but Odyssey felt like far too much of a grind and most of the side content isn't as well crafted as it was in Origins.

There is some cool stuff in this game and gameplay is still the same pretty much, but it plays like some older JRPGs where in order to do the next piece of content you need to grind your level up. Much of the grind was lessened with latter patches but the grind is still too much for me.

That said, if your tolerance for repetitive grind is reasonable (my tolerance for it has dropped significantly as time goes on) then you may still enjoy it.

The best game in the series.

It improves massively on everything. I enjoyed the story, combat, graphics (possibly the prettiest game I've ever seen), and the game had characters I actually gave a s**t about. There's so much to do and it never felt like classic open-world busy work to me. I definitely think it's worth the full price, especially if you love ancient Greece as a setting like I do. The voice actress for Kassandra also did a great job and I think they really came through with the RPG mechanics for this game.

9/10, easy.

I'll keep this as simple and straight forward as possible.

Pros:
- Conversation choices are great. Plenty of humour as well.
- Graphics are gorgeous.
- The photo mode allows for great things.
- Great for pro gamers.

Cons:
- Looting choices are contradictory. You make choices in conversations that are good, yet half of the loot items are restricted behind "Steal". This means you have to do bad things to get everything. Many special chests etc are listed as steal instead of loot. In other words, to get anywhere, you have to be a bad person. I thought Assassins are meant to be good guys in these games??
- Another failure in the game is the levelling system. When I started I saw sidequests and Main missions listed as level 2 recommendation. When I hit level 3, those same missions jumped to match my level. The same goes with enemies. Despite playing on the easiest difficulty (I prefer to play for story than challenge) that I would come across a tough enemy. For example, I was at level 3 and came across a group of enemies at level 3. I couldn't beat them due to the combat system/controls, so I thought that I would leave and level up. So I reached level 4 and returned to them. However, those enemies are now at level 4. This contradicts the difficulty settings.
- Not good for casual gamers.

If you're a pro gamer that can handle the flaws in the game, then that's good. If you're a casual gamer like me, then it's not so good.

I will try to continue playing this game, but I am preferring the previous games.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey brings new life to the series.

I personally started the series with AC3. Played Black Flag and then Unity. Didn't play again till Origins but only played like an hour of it... where Origins lacked, Odyssey has picked up. The game is beautiful, the map huge, the story intriguing. I am emotionally invested in the story of Kassandra (the character I picked). It runs beautifully for me, there is so much to see and do, and every quest doesn't feel as though you're just fetching and doing boring stuff. They all feel grand and the main story has a lot of twists thus far for me. I am 21 hours in (had early play with the gold edition) and I am not even close to being done.

The game is MEANT to be played in Exploration Mode. Doing so insures you have a magical experience, especially with constant progress still being made to the game.

10/10 Assassin's Creed game in my opinion.

This was definitely the best Assassin's Creed game in the series. I haven't felt so compelled by an AC story since ACII. They took the best elements of Origins and combined it with Black Flag to make an epic experience. Cassandra was definitely my favorite character, her voice acting was amazing and she felt so real and authentic. The RPG element was an interesting addition, but I always welcome being given options and choices in my games. Also for the first time, the plot had me interested from beginning to end, always at the edge of my seat. The characters, (ex. Socrates, Markos Alkibiades, etc.) were very lively and fun. I love how they would repeatedly pop up in my odyssey and I would think "OMG! Its this guy again!". The expansion of the Isu lore is really exciting for me and the possibility to fight mythical creatures of legend made the game all the more worth the price. 10/10

Well worth your money, probably the best PC game in its genre since Witcher 3. Average playtime of around 75 hours (and many at 110+) and so long as you play it like the open world rpg it is - which is to say you explore and do side missions - you will never need to grind in the game. Not that it would feel like a grind, the combat is fun and fluid, turning what is usually the least enjoyable part of any game for me into a fun and engaging experience which rewards skill.

The ship travel and combat are both very smooth and engaging, while the mercenary system adds a little spice and consequence to breaking laws.

I have enjoyed the game so much that I've easily played 400 hours over multiple playthroughs (I played a long time offline as well) and thrilled when New Game+ was finally offered.

On my Game+ playthrough I chose not to use fast-travel and either ran, rode, or sailed everywhere I went and I came to appreciate the beautiful setting even more than I already had.

Now that all the DLC are out, I advise you to get the Gold Edition, so you gain access to everything. The Atlantis DLCs offer another 30+ hours of gameplay and are as good as the base game.

(Updated to reflect changes since my original review)

One of the favourite Assassin's Creed Games, but to be honest there is not much assassin and templar scenario in this game. Still with vast world, great scenary, beautiful landscapes and great story, it makes a great game. Modern day gameplay is lacking but... it's like they are picking the story up after Assassin's Creed 3.

UPDATE: Well I completed the game with 100% completion. Seriously the side missions are really different. Nothing will feel repetitive.

One of the best Open world rpg with extreme story rich quests. His historical approach guides you in the ancient world of Hellas , during the Peloponnesian war era. You are between the world of Athenian democracy and the warrior Valor of Sparta, it giving you the feeling that all those you seen is real. For me is one of the best titles ever even though I wasn’t quite fun of the series , I recommend it without second thoughts. I haven’t plyed another game of the series only a bit origins atm , but Odyssey is how the name saying , an odyssey in the world of Hellas in a story that might not being so fairy tail ,,,, or it is …. No matter what is one of the best. Thanks Ubisoft , and thank you steam for this excellent game.

GAMEPLAY :
Best AC gameplay ever, and probably the best in my library, never had i ever played a game for 120++ hours and still play it non stop. But this game crashes to desktop more frequent than usual games. The 180++ hours gameplay was solid fun, the 180 thousand crashes were not.

DLC :
the whole kassandra / natakas romance are forced, cringey, boring, and infuriating. if you offer that many choices, and in the end it doesn't even matter, better just leave it a linear storyline instead of maintaining a poor illusion of choice.

STORY / IMMERSIVENESS :
the game is bad in the storyline since the beginning, because all the consequences are chopped up and not connected. the gameplay is superb 11/10, the story sucks big time. can't recommend this game for it's cheesy story, but its a fun game if you purely play for the open world.

35~fps with an i7700 and 980TI. Game runs like garbage even if you turn shadows off and other heavy-impacting settings.

Maybe if there wasnt bloated DRM on this game it would run better.

the first time i finished this game i tried to play other games...but they felt hollow and meaningless. i wanted to wait a year or so before i played Odyssey again.
i tried.
two weeks later i gave up and just went back home to kephalonia.
best game since witcher 3.

After dumping 90 hours in Origins i was hesitant going into Odyssey because i felt very fatigued towards the end of Origins after doing everything in the game and playing through the DLC because i knew that the mechanics and gameplay in Odyssey would be very similar, and i got exactly what i expected. Odyssey is just more of Origins but with a Greece setting instead. This wouldn't normally be a problem but they've made these newer Assassins Creed games so long that it does become a big issue for me personally. This combat is not that engaging for the amount of hours they want you to sink into these games. It feels floaty and weightless, the attacks lack impact and it's missing that style and flair that the old games had, i criticised origins for the same thing and it's more of the same here just with small additions that don't add much. I also heavily miss the stealth focus that the older games had, it felt core to the Assassins creed experience and that's another problem i have, this just doesn't feel like an Assassins Creed game. It just feels like i'm playing a very average action rpg and i struggle calling it an rpg because it's very surface level stuff, level gating to stretch the length out with dialogue choices that don't add much to the game. Story wise there are a number of videos online detailing how they break the lore of the series and it overall never feels like the story warrants it's existence. The parkour just sucks now too, in the older games they bothered creating every crack to climb onto and you couldn't just grab onto any flat surface like you can in this game, you had to look around to see what you can grab and that added a sense of exploration and strategy. You might as well be Spiderman in this game the way you can just grab onto anything you see, it just doesn't look right.

Kassandra is a blank slate and the dialogue choices suck because she has no character traits or personality in general so you can't role play as her the way you can Geralt from The Witcher for example and i'm assuming Alexios is the same. The game can look great visually at times but the draw distance is pretty awful, Origins was able to hide it because of the Egyptian setting because it's all just sand in the distance but the grass and hills in this game look very bad from afar. This game is very quantity over quality with all the generic side missions and question marks on the map just like in Origins, it's all just very disposable content to stretch out the length of the game by making you do them to level up and progress with the main story. I did the bare minimum possible to get through this game and that did require doing a whole bunch of those boring side missions. Origins felt fresh at the time because it felt like a decent departure from the formula but now they are back to doing the same thing again. I really hope they can go back to the roots of the franchise with the future games, like a game heavily focused on the Creed like the original did for example but i just don't see that happening after the success of this game.
5/10 (Average)

BEFORE DOING THIS REVIEW
Just in case don't forget to buy this game in Gold edition or Ultimate edition so you can get AC III Remaster also AC Liberation game free. So you getting 3 game with one pack. Also if you buy this game in sales. Just put crown at your head. Thx to me later.

But anyway. I m going to be honest about this review

Just finished the game minutes ago. Got good ending. All I can this is really good RPG game and I really liked the story.I know Assasin's Creed games should have Hidden Blade. But remember this game set in 431–422 BC.

Maybe I m writing all these because of I really REALLY love Greek Mythology.You can seriously can equip Ares,Achilles,Agamemnon,Pegasus and many other Ancient Greek heroes Armor,Weapon,Horse design is in this game. Stealth system is not lame and dumb like previous AC games. AI is seriously clever Besides after that lame,boring and useless skill tree game which is AC Origins, this game came to me like Medicine.Skill Tree is amazing and every skill is useful and fun.

Can't say Main Story boss fights are good. BUT side quest Bosses are really good and it's really what you expecting. One example is Legendary Medusa! It was really fun boss.
We have 2 character in this game. Kassandra and Alexios. My recommendation is go with Kassandra. Don't attack me chill. I love both character. But Kassandra's story is the canon one. And best thing is game have New Game Plus mode. Sooo this means you can play with Alexios and all of your collectibles are in New Game Plus mode. It's perfect. (Meanwhile this is my recommendation. You can start with Alexios of course)

We can play with 3 style. Hunter,Warrior,Assasin. But if you don't want only one you can mix both style. Example I m playing with Hunter and Warrior mixed. And I setted my Skill Tree to my style. If you like Stealth gameplay you can do Assasin/Hunter as well. Or even you can do balance all three style which is Hunter/Warrior/Assasin. Yes it's possible!

Main Story is good but can't say Perfect written. Game have 3 ending + 1 secret ending. So we have 4 ending. Your few action will decide the ending. So be careful at your choices.
Speaking about Side Quests. They are really good and better than Main Story. And game have many Romance choices. (I know you horny now. BONK to your head)

All of aside. I can confirm AC Odyssey is good RPG game but not perfect Assasin's Creed game.But like I said game is set in Anctient Greek. And I m okay with that tbh. Game is better than many AC games. Can confirm you can spent 200-300 hours in this game
Hope you gona like this game. Enjoy it.

Easily my game of the year. I've put 100+ hours in it and I'm still having as much fun as when I first started it. I'm en more excited to play the new additions that just keep coming.

The graphics are amazing, the main story is fun and well written, the side quests give you so many other stories to explore. The new mechanics they added with choices really add to the immersion of the game as well. Even hunting the achievements doesn't feel like a chore but like an actual challenge. The abilities tree also enables you to explore different types of playthroughs (or just picking what works best for you!). I'm also a big fan of all the different armor and weaponry cause you get to mix and match so many things and it's just fun.

I could go on and on about the things I loved, although some of my most favorite moments were Kassandra rolling her eyes at almost everyone, basically making men try to hide their wives, always shaking off water after a good swim, and yawning if you pull an all nighter assassinating people.

I 10000% recommend this game, whether you're an old franchise fan or have never even touched it. I guarantee you'll have a blast riding and sailing all around ancient Greece.

I must say that i was positively suprised by Assassin's Creed Odyssey. I bought it after having completed the previous entry, AC Origins, and was expecting it to be very similar and almost indisctinguishable from it's predecessor. What i got was a totally different game, with 2 divergent stories and many RPG mechanics.
Like many people have already remarked, AC odyssey feels like a perfect mix between Back Flag, Origins, and the critically acclaimed Witcher 3, but still manages to keep a very distinguishable "Ancient greece" feeling. The open world is one of the biggest and most magnificent ones to date in the history of video games and the different choice options, although not revolutionary, do manage to change up the game a decent amount. AC Odyssey is also way more intuitive gameply-wise (especially with the new abilities), while being at the same time way less clunky as previous titles. Many new additions were made such as mercenaries, crafting, and private ship crews as well as a lot of meaningful little details (such as getting detected more quickly if you are carrying a torch at night).
All in all, this game is in my opinion one of the best Assassin's Creed games to date and i really do like the direction that this franchise is taking.
A MUST BUY if you like stealth games or open worlds!
9.5/10

It's basically Witcher 3 but with a better combat system, better(much simpler) crafting system, but with not as good quest story lines (it's always go to this place, sneak in and steal something or kill everyone)

All in all if you liked Witcher3 you'll like this

Bought the game during sale omg. I have always been a fan of AC, so was excited to try this, specially since it is set in the Athenian-Spartan era.
I love how beautiful the game is. I love stopping around and gazing at the scenery. They even focused no tiny details like dragonflies!
It is so much fun to dive in the sea as well.
The game play is nice.
No phantom blade though :<
We can tame wild animals :3
Story line: ????
Characters are nice, I play as Kassandra :3

This Assassin's Creed game if the first who have question so it is some kind of RPG because all the choises are no matter.

There are not side and main quests but both named just quests. It has many quests toooooo many quests!!!
Of course there is a storyline but is not have main effect at the quests

The graphics are stuning at 4K with HDR+ but again no SLI support F..k you Ubisoft about it. Of course I try it at 1080p and it is the game with the most great graphics at 1920X1080.

One new spec is at the icons of skinsmiths are not appeared (you must find them and remember where they are) and you have the choice to change one spec of your weapon e.g. from 4% crit hit to go to + 8% life the same at the armors. When you level up the specs are leveling up a 5 level player has +4% life a player who is 30 level has +8% life choise.

But al least is runs smoth at 30 FPS ONLY GRRRRR !!!!
Great job for single GPU game but SLI is always SLI and if it supported i may play the game at 60 FPS like Far Cry 5 I hope this year Nvidia inspector find the Dual GPU gamers a resolve.

The gameplay is almost the same with Origins but you cannot hold shield only weapons.

I will update this review when I play more hours the game.

Now I've played Odyssey before (on UPlay before buying on Steam) and honestly the game didn't hit me as much as I expected it to be but as this was my second playthrough and I didn't rush through the game and decided to take my time and hoping that maybe a second run would win me over, it definitely did. Yes, the open world is DEFINITELY bloated and far too big but the more you explore it and the more synchronisation points you have, the more easier it will become in the later part of the game. Hunting down the Cult one by one and reading the lore about each member is really satisfying, it's one of the things I love most about the newer AC games is hunting down the orders/cults/groups etc.. and reading backstories about the sick and twisted people that joined these organisations.

This is an Assassin's Creed game by name, not by nature. I do miss the old stealth and the old combat but for what Odyssey offered, it was a solid experience no doubt.

After completing the game and pushing myself to the end of the Cult of Kosmos, I've walked away feeling just a tad bit hollow about Odyssey. It's tough to call it a crappy game considering the amount of effort that went into the world and it's different islands. Ultimately I don't recommend this game to fans of the original Assassins for a few very select reasons.

The first thing that bothers me is the setting-i love the war between Sparta and Athens and the time period definitely feels good to visit, but I'm bothered that they chose Greece directly after Origins. Its predecessor nailed a pretty assassinesque location with Egypt and I was very excited to see where they would go next. Now I'm disappointed that they left at all because Odyssey feels a lot like Origins but with some unfortunate subtractions. The game is told on the eve of the spartan occupation of Athens and deals with Kassandra and Alexios, two very special individuals belonging to a very mystical line of important people. Below I list spoilers so if you're not bothered than keep on reading.

In short, the point of the story is to highlight the occupation of the guardian of Atlantis-a librarian/protect of the lost city. The side quests dealing with this include mythic beasts, which were honestly the only thing "Odyssey" about this whole thing. Essentially the point is to secure all the pieces of Atlantis' library that were stolen and return them to the gates, just to be told that you cant actually explore the ruins or go past the gates. This left me pretty jaded as they seemed to hype the occupation of Atlantis a fair bit only to tell me that's it. I'd thought originally that maybe they just dropped the ball with it, but nah-they were skirting the Atlantis occupation so they could sell it to us as DLC almost a year later. This sort of means that Odyssey is a game that not only doesn't recognize its identity as a game, it doesn't recognize its identity as an Assassins game.

Sure, it's very large and expansive and has a number of different locations to treat your inner explorer and I dug sailing around Greece with my female pirate crew. The missions are numerous yet short, and mostly just feel like lazy fetch quests tasking me with going to X to do Y. This is the essence of game development but here it is just so uninspired and bland that you often wonder why you're helping a lady retrieve her lost necklace in a forest. Do we excuse fetch quests for the sake of long hours to add to a game's objective quality? Of the 80 or so hours I spent with it, I would say 40 of them I understood where I was and why.

It just doesnt make sense, and much of the time I wondered where I was or why I was there. I would say half of the side quests have some substance in that they have actual story, but again that story is so lazily told and threaded together it makes the quest feel like a chore rather than an adventure. It's just constructive enough to give you a task to occupy yourself with, but the gusto to inspire you to do the task isnt really there other than XP.

Which is kind of a speed bump in a game about trying to emanate RPG elements. Past AC games have suffered in their combat and skill trees in that they have made it too watered down and mainstreamed for complex gamers. Here the combat isn't so much improved as it has been just stretched out. I remember being able to kill crowds of Italian soldiers as Ezio with a few choice button presses and good rhythm. It was probably best to move on from those days but I cant help but feel that we've lost the feel of intricate and lethal combat. It plays far more like a Devil May Cry game than anything and it blows. They've taken away the variety in bows that we had in the previous game which I think is the biggest disappointment, s I really enjoyed ranged game play. In Odyssey it hasn't been so much watered down as it just been unnecessarily changed.

It's also not like they decided to take those things out-Odyssey is developed by a separate team from Montreal, the real rock stars of Assassins Creed. Quebec seems to have taken Odyssey and selfishly replicate elements from its sister game and make it's own dive at trying to be a story driven RPG. In some places I welcome this but in others it's just changed for the worse, and I think combat is one of those areas.

We have the addition of power combos assigned to different buttons, if like dragons dogma. It's alright, but not really what I was hoping for when I thought of future AC combat. And for that matter, it doesn't really appeal as an RPG that well although it's certainly better than most generic games of that type. I could've done without honestly.

To finish, I would say that this game is a disappointment because it assumes that adopting RPG and story driven elements like dialogue and such are somehow excusing it of having poor quality mission structure and story or being incohesive with its RPG elements. If you ignore the immersion problems I guess you'll enjoy it. But personally I feel like I shouldn't have even bothered, and I just wish that I didn't have to play through the whole game just to realize that.

-The game forces player to do alot of side quest to level up and be able to continue main story, when most of the side quests are boring and offer no material including good plot or new locations.

-a lot of bugs, game freezes to load textures, and now a new bug that don't show any of the quests.

-The art style of this game is not new and unique, it is very simillar to origins.


-Sometimes shadow of an entire building disapears with just small camera or player movement.

-Far distances don't have much quality.

-Some shadows and objects are rendered with a delay on far distances when turning your head around.


-Loading times are too long

-Opening game menus including inventory and ability screen etc has an annoying delay.

-Unlike Origins, your bird can't be used as a mini map because of short icon highlighting in bird view, so you have to open the map and check many times which the map itself is a mess and has huge delay to open it.

-Almost impossible to do most of quests stealthy way and always things go for open fight.

"Spartans are Red" . "Athens are Blue" . "This game is fun and you should try it too".

No really this game is fun and amazing and it makes a twist on not being an Assassin but being a mercenary in the most epic story and elements in the game that feels like other famous rpg and open world games but this game makes it better in situation in the world of Greece and combines all the elements that the developers use in the past game and combines it all to make a master piece. and I rate the game 10/10

AC 1 was an amazing proof of concept. So atmospheric, and the parkour was great.
AC 2 was a properly enjoyable story with great characters and lots of replayability.
AC3 was just awful.
Unity is probably still my favourite in the series, Syndicate was truly impressive.
But Odyssey is a masterpiece. In my opinion, the first videogame to really deserve to be called that, and the first to really fulfil Ubisoft's goal of making videogames a true artistic medium.
Also, my Mrs, who is not a gamer at all, loves the songs, and thinks Kassandra is gorgeous. So there's that, too.

TLDR: Received as a Christmas gift, but would consider it worth the full price - this game is gripping. It has been a long time since I've been this excited about playing a game throughout the day while busy doing other things.

Verdict: Odyssey has a compelling story, a beautiful world and it is just so fun to explore. The new features that give you more freedom than the typical AC experience are spot on.

Comparison with rest of series:
I feel a lot more like I did while playing Far Cry 3 (exploring, infiltrating forts, hunting, levelling my skills) rather than the previous AC games (I'm playing as Kassandra on exploration mode) -- I expect this deviation may not be ideal for all fans of the series, but I think it adds back the spark to the AC games which I had felt they had lost. I have not really been able to get behind an Assassin's Creed game since AC II and Brotherhood, the latest one I have tried being Syndicate (which I remain very very far from finishing and don't know if I'll go back to).
While it is a bit more difficult to play pure stealth because your level may determine whether you can one-hit kill someone, this just makes it all the more interesting rather than being as easy as previous games.

An aside: wtf is with people giving negative reviews for games because they can't figure out how to launch them? Sort your gear out.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a typical Ubisoft product and a perfect example of what's going wrong in the gaming industry for years now.
I've never liked the AC franchise, even back in 2007. The only reason why I bought Odyssey is because of the historical period and the lack of games which have in it. I have finished every single quest up to The Fate of Atlantis: Episode 1 (DLC) including. A lot of people like to point out how much content it offers but in truth is quantity over quality, in an old Ubisoft fashion.

A question, that is often asked when it comes to historical inspired games, is how historically accurate it is?
Although the world is true to history (more about it below), there are a lot of historical inaccuracies for gameplay's sake like Sparta magically having a big navy and Athens can magically hold it's own in all these open land battles. For some reason, both armies don't know anything about strategies, doctrines or even combat formations. Big conquest battles are chaotic 1v1 fights. A lot of the weapons look too big and I don't understand why? It doesn't even make the look "cooler" or "more epic". The majority of Greeks look like modern Arabs from North Africa.

The good:
• Odyssey's world is the best recreation of Ancient Greece that you will find anywhere! This is the main reason why I have spent so many hours. Ubisoft included so many small details that truly make the world historical accurate. The best example is probably colored statues. The world is filled with recreations of real monuments and buildings. It is huge and diverse with plenty of content in it. The game also has a database function where you can visit and learn all about the Greek world.

• The inclusion of mythical creatures is done very well and doesn't break the immersion. They are all on remote locations, can be missed and don't affect the overall story. A fun addition.

• A wide variety of gear. Most of it is historically accurate but some of it is inspired by Greek myths and Greek heroes. For example the Agamemnon or Achilles armors.

• I really liked the idea behind the Cult of Kosmos controlling both sides in the war for their own purposes.

The bad and the ugly:
• The story is weird.  But you never really care about any of the characters or feel connected to them.

• Far from being a true RPG! None of your choices matter or have any consequences except when it comes to your family members - kill them or spare them. That's it! You don't even have a role to play. People consider you a demigod. No classes. You can be a good assassin, hunter and warrior at the same time.

• Arcade mechanics and gameplay with little to no challenge. The AI is terrible. Enemies are often blind and deaf. They won't even alarm others when they find bodies. There is no fall damage! You can jump from wherever you want and won't die. You eagle can spot and mark everything even if it's underground. How about being ambushed by 2-5 damage sponge mercenaries? Very good idea, right?

• Most NPC look the same and the characters are very poorly animated in cutscenes. Far from AAA quality for 60€. The emotional reactions and face motions are simply terrible.

• I'm not against representing females more in different media but how exactly constantly killing women, some of which look like males, help?

• Odyssey is poorly optimized and people have been complaining since launch. Texture popping, crashes and stuttering are common even on a high-end PC.

• Ubisofts greed got bigger with every patch. Increasing the level cap (twice already, almost doubling it from 50 -> 70 -> 99) and lowering resource gain from in-game mechanics with every update is just to be explained with them trying to force you either into a needless, unnecessary grind that is frustrating or into spending money on their helix credits and in-game boosters. This, considering we are talking about a full prized singleplayer game is just infuriating and outrageous.

• Don't bother with the DLC's! Uninspired, mediocre and more of the same. Not worth the 40€ (!!!).

Conclusion:
Definitely not a game I will ever replay. This is one of those moments when I wish Steam would add a "neutral" button. Recommend only when on sale because of the world and the amount of content it offers even though it's repetitive.

Disappointed.
I love the environment, and the RPG part is also a positive twist.
However, there is far too much grinding.
You’re 50% legendary warrior, 50% mailman/woman.
The legendary battles are not epic.
The ship aspect was better in Black Flag.

In my opinion, an almost-masterpiece.

The RPG elements are great, experimenting with builds and paying attention to engravings and the gear you carry, all the while you can visually customise all the gear you are wearing (I've always hated games that forced you to wear gear that just looked so ugly but had great stats - this game fixes that).

I enjoy the combat and the large battles, effecting the power of the different nations between Athenians or Spartans, and much of the 'demi-god' powers/abilities you unlock are quite satisfying.

Not to forget that the world is just stunning, with many locations just so pleasing to take in and explore or walk around in as you take in the scenery.

The downside for me is that it just lacks an 'Assassin's Creed' story, and seems more like it should just be a spin-off game within the franchise. However, don't get me wrong, the story itself is engaging and interesting, with multiple endings based on your choices throughout the main quest-line.

I write this after over 900 hours of my life on this game, and I have no regrets. I also write this after playing Valhalla for some time... and seeing how much of a step back Valhalla is for me. If you're conflicted between buying Odyssey or Valhalla, I would strongly recommend Odyssey.

Not an "Assassin's Creed" game but not at all a bad game either. Wish Ubisoft came up with a new franchise for this game rather than naming it an "Assasin's Creed" game.

Story by far is the best thing about this game.
Graphical optimisations are not that great but better than Origins.

Rating - 8/10

Awesome game, awesome story, awesome graphics

Mediocre combat system, RPG elements, movement and optimization

Lots of content and things to do crammed into one game with surprisingly little bugs on launch even

A tad repetetive and needs something to be amazing ...certainly not microtransactions. Thumbs down for this, otherwise a very solid game.

WARNING FOR SPOILERS! <<<<<<<<<

Wtf Ubisoft. So far I enjoyed the game like I did with Origins, until the Legacy of the First Blade DLC. Again: SPOILER! DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET.

Giving us players narrative choices to shape our character the way we want him/her to be and then after almost 100 hours of playtime forcing said character into a life-changing decision about sexuality (maybe some players didn't want a hetero relationship or already had someone they liked) and having a child is a serious gameplay misstep and more than just narratively dissonant.
Especially when said character like my Kassandra went so gd OOC, she turned from a badass mercenary into a dull housewife, going happily to town to fetch some bread and milk for the fam. The joy. /sarcasm

Settling down and starting a family is NOT everyones life goal ffs or for her to preserve the stupid bloodline, why, try her brother! Thanks for ruining my character.

Don't add choices, giving me the feeling I can form a character/personality and change it in the middle of the game to a forced and not avoid- or skipable story without regard for the players choices.

Oh, and one of the best parts:

"I've faced walls of flame, skies black with arrows, and more beasts and blades than Herakles himself... But none match parenthood." - Well, f*ck you too.

This Assassin's Creed is practically a spin off of the series, it stands out a bit in everything but it does it in a big way by bringing out an excellent gameplay (which however can be tasted REALLY in the ABOVE normal difficulty), an absolute thrilling narrative. best of the series both in terms of direction and plot (which INCREDIBLE, is not trivial)

Speaking of everything else:
-the setting is really beautiful, lots of green and many cities that are all beautiful and well characterized, you can see that a very in-depth study has been done to reach such levels. In addition, the map is immense and there are many regions to explore or islands.
-The secondary quests instead are like in Witcher 3, they are divided between the classic hunts for bandits and bounties with 0 subplots up to more iconic quests with developed plots or very funny gangs.The system of choices is done well and leads you to a total of 9 different endings.
The boss fights as seen so far are put in a coherent way and are fun.
-The skill trees and the various abilities, are all wonderful and allow you to play a little as you want (personally I love the bow) and to follow your fighting style, the feeling with the weapons is really well done, you notice a lot of difference when you wield a different weapon instead the feedback of the shots (and sometimes the hitboxes too) are slightly confusing.
-For the AI ​​instead, a significant step forward has been made, the game is much more complicated than its predecessors but mainly because they stopped attacking you one at a time and do more damage than usual, thanks also to an rpg component that creates even more difficulties especially if you face enemies with a few levels higher than you, but there is still a lot to do
-The social and interactive component is interesting, it allows you to weaken an enemy region and cause the invasion of the opposite force (e.g. if the region is from sparta and you weaken the Spartan army in the area, the Athenians will invade after a while) which leads to a pitched battle for control of it. Same thing happens at sea with ships.
- Speaking of the latter, the visual impact with the water is fantastic and fighting at sea makes its effect, moreover the feeling with the spur of the ship or with javelins is absolutely fantastic, for the rest from this point of view, nothing brand new from what we saw in Black Flag, just a more of the same of the naval part improved but with fewer weapons available.
-The grinding (without xp boost) is not frustrating but only enjoyable, there are so many things to do and a huge world to explore which is easy to get lost and level without realizing it.
In conclusion I highly recommend this game

I really really love this game!! I'm super into Greek Mythology and I also love RPG games so it's like this game was made for me. Also I'm not really good at in-game combat in most games, so it was a challenge at first but I literally felt myself getting better and better in my playthrough. Another HUGE win in this game is the graphics; the game looks INSANELY good. The game itself is also enormous; I'm close to 30 hours in and I feel like I've hardly scratched the surface.

I would have liked to see more interactions with the random NPCs that walk around, and more of a trading/bartering system other than just the blacksmith. I also got somewhat frustrated at first because it felt like combat was never a fair fight; it was always a bunch of people a level or so above you ganging up on you at once. Maybe that's a feature rather than a bug, but I would have liked more one on one combat.

Jesus christ this game is a chore. A massive, massive chore. But a chore that i found somewhat satisfying to complete.

I basically 100% this game, not including achievements, I did all the quests, all the side quests, all the question marks, all the artemis hunts.. Everything. I can say that 40% of my time with this game was just meaningless grind whereas the other 60% was good good fun.

Nice locations to explore, an okay story and a beautiful but large map. Personally, im not a fan of the new AC direction considering that other Devs do it much better and it doesn't really make sense for this format to adopt an annual release schedule.

A lot of the repeatable side stuff is stupidly boring and lazy. Your Main Character could be some nice fella who loves people or whatever but the repeatable side quests won't care for that. Its literally just

'Alexios/Kassandra! come here'
'Yes?'
'This man did this bad thing to me'
'Oh no, you want me to go teach him a lesson?'
'No go kill'
????????

thats it, thats all you do. Kill random people because people said to, no choice, no other options; Go kill?!?!?!?

But i skipped all those, not worth it.

Get this game for the setting and locations mostly, and if you get tired of the monotonous side stuff, just don't do it; its not worth it..

Also if you hate the new AC format, you won't like this.
 

all good

Haven't played Valhalla, but I've played Brotherhood, 3, and Black Flag. This is by far the best out of those games, the map size, sailing, armor, and RPG aspects just make this a level above the others in my opinion. The cultist revealing system is also really satisfying, and I love all the side activities such as hunting legendary animals and fighting mythical creatures. This is the first AC game I've actually been motivated to try to 100% because its not all just boring stealth, you can run into an enemy camp and just destroy people with a giant mace if you want. Highly recommend to fans of AC and RPG games

Ótimo jogo! A movimentação do herói é bem fluída. Os gráficos, cenários e paisagens são muito bonitos. Tem missões fáceis, médias e difíceis. A história é bem interessante e o contato com os personagens da época torna tudo mais divertido. A variedade de equipamentos e atividades é grande e o mapa é enorme.

My life has not been the same since completing this game...at its height, this was what kept me motivated throughout the day, made me excited when I had free time and almost made me feel complete as I was immersed in a stunning open world with beautiful visuals and wholesome stories. But the large and now decrepit cavity that the lack of this game has left on my soul it is a deep scar that keeps everyday life bleak and almost...not worth living

I've not played AC since it's inception. The only other Assassins Creed I played was the very first one. I was mildly interested in that and I got as far as I could before I realised how crap it was.

However it appears things have come along way since then.

I have to say I am very much addicted to Odyssey,. The exploration and customisation is beyond what I expected. The story and characters are also believable and occasionally humorous.

There is lots to see and do in this game, forget the story if you like exploring a beautiful looking historical environment then this game is for you.

I am really not sure why all the negative reviews. After reading far too many, it seems they mostly stem from people having computer issues, and blaming the game (mine runs flawlessly) ,diehard series fanboys who resist change from what they are accustomed too, or issues with dlcs and in game purchases.
In all honesty I can say Assassins creed odyssey is a great buy (especially on sale!) For many many hours of great fun. The scenery is beautiful as expected, the fight mechanics come together nicely after you play a little bit. For these game types, I tend to sit back, crack a beer, grab a controller and just chill out. (The alt controller layout is much better than default imho). While I may only be 10 hours in at the time of this writing, its easy to see that I will be getting my money's worth many times over. If you're on the fence about buying, like I was, I recommend pulling the trigger and picking it up. You wont regret it! Cheers!

This game is easily one of my favorite games. The story drags you in and keeps you wanting to know what happens next. The graphics and lighting are stunningly beautiful. The female protagonist that I chose to play as, is also easily one of my favorite protagonists that I have ever played as. The game is extremely more of an RPG compared to the previous Assassin's Creed games. This iteration gives you a lot more control in regards to choices in terms of the character you play, and how you carry out your missions.

This game includes ability trees just like previous games, but it definitely allows you to cater more towards your own playstyle. There is also a large array of weapons and armor to provide perks and aesthetics that cater better to different people's preferences. Another feature that I greatly appreciate, which was added in an update a few months after release, is that you can change the appearance of your armors/weapons to the appearance of other armors/weapons that you have collected in your adventures, so that you can keep your favorite perks from the original set of armor/weapons that better suits your playstyle, without causing you to hate how your character looks.

The fighting mechanics are also a lot like how it was in Assassin's Creed: Origins, except for the shields, as you can not block in this game. It is extrmely important to dodge and/or parry when fighting in this game, but I never felt that it was overly difficult for me, when playing at my selected difficulty. In regards to playtime, I put in over 100 hours before completing the main game including all of the side quests, and I have maybe only done half of the miscellaneous locations. Plus, if you want to play for even more time, there are DLC that will add even more hours and lore to your gameplay.

Regarding bugs, there were a few times that my character did not do as intended or an ability that I have made a required action funny by making a dead body invisible, but none of those issues were game breaking. I will admit though, that there was one bug that I encountered that prevented me from playing a certain side quest, but an update resolved that problem for me.

In terms of performance, the fps was very stable but it is a fairly tasking game. I play at custom max settings, and usually get an average of 60 fps, when playing at a 3440x1440 resolution.

If you played Assassin's Creed: Origins, and you loved it, I can extremely recommend this game as I was surprised that I ended up loving this game more than how much I loved that game. If you are new to Assassin's Creed or are just a casual adventure game player, I still would highly recommend this game!

I have played every game in the Assassin's Creed series since release, and I'd say that Odyssey is the best game in the series arguably overall, and at least since AC2. Would highly recommend purchasing the base game either on sale or at full price, however the DLC pricing concerns me.

Positives:
- Actual RPG elements added; different dialogue options and choices to make inside the game that directly influence the outcome of quests (many questlines, including the main one, have multiple outcomes depending on your choices)
- Beautiful graphics, set in gorgeous locations - by far the prettiest AC game aesthetically to date. Textures seem to be slightly upgraded from Origins, although fire physics are worse for some reason. The game runs better overall for me on an i7 6700 + GTX 1080, despite having a larger world and higher textures than Origins
- Good storyline overall, with extremely likeable protagonists - in my opinion, the best ones since Ezio (I played as Alexios, but Kassandra is also very likeable). The voice acting is only "good" though, compared to Abubakr Salim's *incredible* voice acting of Bayek.
- Easily able to amass over 50 hours of playtime in the base game alone, making it great value for money. If you're the type of person that likes to grind out every single objective, quest and location marker, you can expect to almost double that (although grinding isn't as necessary as in previous games, simply via exploration and the odd sidequest I found myself overlevelled in almost all areas)
- Melee and ranged combat feels smoother and more refined than in previous games, naval combat is largely optional but extremely fun (and this is coming from someone who *didn't* like it in Black Flag)
- Greatest level of customization possible with character perks/inventory/ship/etc. featured in the franchise to date

Negatives:
- Some controls still feel a little clunky, as though they were optimized for consoles rather than PC players (big no-no)
- Some events in the main storyline were easily predictable
- The infinite number of mercenaries in the nemesis system becomes laborious rather than fun/challenging once you've worked your way to the highest tier
- They've removed instant fast travel to cities. I'm usually not someone who likes fast travelling, but in a 130km2 sized map it can sometimes be inconvenient to only travel to the nearest synchronization points


Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8.5-9/10, and would highly recommend it to anyone who is at all familiar with the genre or franchise. It's the first game in a long time where I've been motivated to actually play it for any longer than about an hour at a time. 9/10.

If you're a fan of the AC, this is probably the best of the bunch. Odyssey continues to add new systems and complexity as the game progresses and, in my opinion, is a big step forward for the series. This feels like a true rpg at times.

That said, it's a shame that the greed of Ubisoft has allowed such a fun game to get overshadowed by the microtransaction BS. The micros are plentiful and game altering should you choose to purchase them. I'm not sure who they are meant to appeal to though as "reveal all locations on the map," sort of defeats the purpose of playing an open world game to begin with.

I'm conflicted, but the game is just too much fun to not recommend. Just please, please, please, dont purchase anything from the in game store.

The game is even better than origins, the history is excellent, the combat is good and the skills on the tree are great(spartan kick is actually really fun at the beginning of the game). The mercenary system is balanced and even better than origins.
Stealth is harder than origins if you don't have the right build/skills at the beginning of the game.

And one tip for those with problems with the photos(from photo mode) in the sync from travel fast. If you can't travel fast cause of the photos, try to zoom out, so you don't need to delete them everytime you need to travel, and you don't need to disable photo mode.

If you need any advice for this game, tell me i am happy to help :).

Edit: this is the performance of my computer in the game https://imgur.com/a/6BZhMM3

Edit2: Even if i am cool that they add things like transmog or auto-crafting arrrows, stop adding achievements ¬¬-

The game is PHENOMENAL it's vert pretty and impressive.
Yes, the core mechanisms are 100% derived from origins with some new welcoming improvements, but Ubisoft never denied it nor claimed otherwise.
Would you prefer something completely new? I’m accustomed to origins playstyle so it is a relief that I’m not forced to learn a new playstyle all over again.
It was known and reported from the first time that the game would feel and play like origins, it’s on the same engine afterall but trust me it is a far more good-looking game.
The missions and all side activities are just like you remember from origins which is fine by me because i loved how you had camps, fortresses, treasure hunting etc, we still have a ton of stuff to do in Odyssey.
The game is much harder than origins which is something i already knew but i thought it would probably be an exaggeration but no, the game is harder even on normal and that makes all fights intense, interesting and demanding believe me you will feel like a true spartan hero.
The problems are minor and not worth reporting i am sure all of them will be addressed shortly in future updates.

The game is outstanding, grab your helmet and start your own Odyssey across the mountains and the seas. But remember ! The fate of Greece journeys with You.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey just like Origins This game is also one the most beautiful game in the Assassins Creed series.

Plot: Odyssey is a big adventure that has its highs and lows but ultimately provides an enjoyable journey through Ancient Greece. The story is great, and the world is breathtaking, which is arguably the most important part of the game. Alexios or Kassandra, descendants of legendary spartan Leonidas, as they fight the Templars – a group of evildoers who continue to act as the series main antagonists, despite still forming throughout this instalment. I took on the role of Kassandra, who is easily the most charismatic and interesting of the two protagonists.

Gameplay: When dialogue fails to deliver, which it often does, her stellar portrayal and evident charm often times steal the show. How she behaves is decided by the player, with a handful of options available in all conversations. They normally follow a binary choice of good or evil, with many quests tasking you with killing an enemy or showing mercy and letting them go. Combat is an absolute blast, ripe with enough customisation for strategy that I didn’t grow bored of things. also bringing back the Naval Combat system is a bold idea done by ubisoft. A huge treat for fans who loves AC4 Black flag.

Exploration: The Greek Islands is a frequent joy, and discovering new locations is encouraged as you surpass the level threshold required to conquer even the hardest of areas. They’re packed with an abundance of side quests and points of interest, although the latter become little more than busywork.

Overall, its a very good game . i can give it 8.5 / 10 !

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is another accomplished entry which expanding upon the blueprint established by Origins to next level.

Expanding on the characteristics from Origins. More extensive, better looking, improved existing mechanics. The story is engaging, with a fantastic protagonist. The RPG element is excellent. Newcomers can enjoy it. Improvements are needed on some of the dialogues. The recreation of ancient Greece is terrific worth the exploration after the main story.

The game is fun and HUUUUGE. You can walk hours upon hours around the map and just enjoy the view. Or so much else. I would rate this game a 9.5/10. Not a 10/10 because the first hours were a little confusing about what was going on, but that went away pretty soon.

I have over 100 hours into this game and still have so much left to do! it's such a huge game with so much you can do. Beautiful game, combat is fun, story is great. One of my favourite assassins creed games for sure. Also love using the ship, really glad they made it a main feature in this and origins again. Was one of the best things about black flag.

At the time of this review, I have about 80 hours into Assassin's Creed® Odyssey. In my opinion this is the best Assassin's Creed since Assassin's Creed Black Flag. ACO is a gorgeous game with quite a bit of depth. There's so much more to do and experience than prior AC titles. The world is absolutely massive and detailed beautifully. I've found myself completely immersed in the era and attached to the protagonist. I would get lost sometimes for hours just exploring and taking awesome screenshots with the Assassin's Creed Photo Mode, which freezes time in game. This allows you to free-roam with your camera around your character to take fantastic pictures. The combat in this game does take some getting used to, it's completely revamped from the last AC title I played (Syndicate). That being said, once you get it down, the combat is so fun and satisfying. There is also a new crime penalty system. Basically there's all these very strong mercenaries, and if you commit a crime in sight of civilian or soldier, you will accumulate a bounty. With enough witnessed crimes, these powerful mercenaries will come for you to claim that bounty, all with their own traits, skills and sometimes furry companions. Depending how much bounty you have acquired you can have 1-5 of these guys coming after you. They will show up wherever you are randomly which can get you in some tough situations if you're in the middle of a mission. The sea battles are quite fun, I was hesitant about it with the lacking of cannons but it's amazingly fun. All in all, very fun and interesting mechanics. If you like Assassin's Creed, any of them, or a fan of the historical setting, this is the game for you.

Goods-
- Combat system and skill specialization (Hunter, Warrior, Assassin).
- Sea battles are extremely fun.
- Graphics are beautiful.
- Runs flawless on my average PC.
- Play in a world where you can easily lose yourself in a historically epically immersive experience.
- The new bounty system.
- Campaign has been great and enticing. (I'm about half-way through the story at the time of this review)
- Assassin's Creed Photo Mode.

Bads-
- Ubisoft’s microtransaction store
- Friends and family will hate how much time you end up losing playing this game.

Hi everyone! Thanks for tuning in to “Cooking with the Watcher!” With today’s installment, we’re going to tackle one of my new favorite recipes, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. It’s a Greek spin on a traditional Assassin’s Creed dish, with lots of flavor from other franchises mixed in. Depending on how long it takes you to prepare and what extra flavors you add, this journey can take anywhere from 45 to 100 hours to complete. If you want add all the extra flavors and really experience everything this dish has to offer, plan on a longer preparation time. But you better come hungry, because this only serves one. For today’s review, we’ll be making the full plate.

As with almost all Assassin’s Creed dishes, we’ll start with the base layer. This foundation supports every Assassin’s Creed dish we make, and Odyssey is no different. So, add in a healthy dose of classic assassination gameplay, versatile parkour skills, synchronization points, horseback riding, and period-appropriate historical figures into our chosen Greek setting, and we’re off to a good start. For Ancient Greece, we recommend Socrates and Pericles. Throw in some mythical beasts too, for good measure.

Like we prepared in our Egyptian-themed entrée Origins, we’ll be adding the ability to tag enemies and a progression element. If you want to Spartan Kick harder, or manually guide your own arrows, you can! Maybe poison your enemies, or light them aflame? This versatility allows aspiring Watchers to really tailor their experience to their tastes.

We also enjoyed the seafaring saltiness of our Caribbean meal, so we will be sprinkling that liberally across the adventure. With all the islands to explore and Cultists to dispatch, what better way to traverse than by sea? We’ve even added some Greek poems to be sung as shanties, to really nail that Aegean flavor.

It’s time now to add our second layer, and the most substantial layer of this dish: combat. While our previous recipes had stricter ideas of how combat marinated with the rest of the dish, we have other plans here. Similar but more refined than Origins, we will go with a free-flowing combat system, similar to top chefs at Rocksteady and their Arkham specialty dish. Gear allocation will be simple, following Diablo III’s industry-standard color-coded tier template.

Now that we’ve got the second layer of the meal ready, it’s time to see where we can really make this dish pop. What we did with Odyssey is look at other successful meals, and pull some ideas from what worked with them and incorporate that into our flavor profile.

For Odyssey, we went straight for the Witcher III and pulled as much as we could from that five-star meal. Thus, we decided to add unearthing question marks, intra-island traversal, multiple dialogue choices, and even bedding multiple suitors to this increasingly eclectic dish.

It’s important to bring some earthy notes into this meal, so we looked at Shadow of War’s Nemesis system and decided to make some small adjustments to it. Gone are the window dressing of flashy introductions and personality traits that made that system so unique, instead we're adding a generic creme fraiche version to really pad out the flavor.

To make sure your eyes don't get bigger than your stomach during this feast, we decided to sprinkle in a bit of graduated leveling to our design. Even if you revisit parts of the meal that you tried previously, you’ll find that its contents have grown with you. But not in a bacterial way.

If you follow these steps, you should have a fully fledged Assassin’s Creed Odyssey meal ready to serve one lucky individual. As mentioned above, be prepared to be hungry!

Pros:

+ So much to do
+ Takes the best parts of several other franchises and adds them together beautifully
+ Excellent characters
+ Great setting and production values
+ Sea shanties will get stuck in your head

Cons:

- Too much to do
- Sometimes can come off as a hodgepodge of several other franchises
- An unexpected amount of inventory management is necessary
- Story is unfocused

This is the best Assassin's Creed game I have ever played. It can feel repetitive at times with enemy padding at high level but as you're pushing damage percentiles it doesn't matter all that much.

Ancient Greece, legends and myths, lots of war, great story, huge open world. I have over 100 hours and I'm just about to hit the end of the main quest line, there's so much to do it's pretty surprising. I still have two DLCs to go and a NG+.

Great job with this one, Ubisoft. I give it 8.5/10.

One hundred eighty-eight hours later... I thought this game would never end.

Update: The sound is now fixed again, it's back to being a great game. Some people are reporting lower framerates after the current patch though.

Warning! They issued a ~5GB update today, Dec 14 2021, that breaks character sound. They now can only be heard in cutscenes, not during the game. I advise avoiding buying this until it is verified as fixed.

First of all, this is not a Assasin´s Creed game. If you want to play something like that please look older games. This is a RPG set in Assasin´s Creed universe and its sole purpouse is to build story of not well known race of Isu, humans precursors in AC universe.

Pros:
- Its long. Very very long. It has loads of thing to do in its world.
- Story is decent.
- Graphics are stunning and has decent optimisation (played with RTX 2070 Max-Q)
- Has lots of integrated different mechanics like ship combat & upgrade and bosses & lackeys
- Bosses brings different mechanics and not just blind combats
- You can feel that you are getting stronger with each level-up (but scaling axes most of that feeling)

Cons:
- Grinding. Story missions are level gated and forces you to grinding OR buying XP boosts from microtransactions. A huge cash grab for people who don´t have a lot of free time.
- Its very repetative.
- I was able to guess so called ´main evil´ of the game in seconds after uncovering the first clue. (There is 8 clues total and game reveals its name after collecing all 8 of them. I was able to find it on first one very easly as its very obvious)

Overall: There is tons of stuff to do. While most of them repetative and boring there are fun activities as well. Daughters of Artemis quest line for example. As it has different playstyles it is interensting for first 50-60 hours. After that it won´t be that much fun since it introduces nothing new. DLC´s are well made so i recommend buying gold edition while its on sale. A decent RPG from Ubisoft.

Score: 65/100

Origins did it better.


Pros
- Graphics have been further improved as well as options. The game gives you more choices for tweaking to help improve your FPS (Frames Per Second).
- Main Story: The main story will keep you interested and wanting to know what happens next.
- Different Abilities: you have new abilities to choose from and your choices do matter.

Cons ( Brace yourself)
- Side Missions:
They are boring and tedious. While the main story quests give you important options to choose from, side mission's choices do not. The NPC/people in the game view you as a god, yet send you to find X object, kill X person, or even find their damn husband.

Travel Time:

Some missions require extensive amounts of travel time. One such shinying example is a side quest where you must take an athlete to where he will compete. Sounds simple enough. You have to travel by boat, over waves, 2,000-3,000 meters to get to him. Then to take him to the area where he will compete is another 7,000 meters. I found myself watching either youtube or messing around on Facebook more than actually playing the game.


- Combat
Combat feels like it was made more simplistic. In origins you had to time your parry well to be able to get a good counter attack in. However in Odyssey when parrying, you get a 3 second window in which if you are attacked, even by multiple enimies, you will parry. You don't even need to be facing the enemy either to parry.

- Less Abilities
While the abilities given do bring new play styles to combat, origins had extensivly more options. The menu and options feel once again dumbed down like the combat. To make matters worse unlike in origins, after reaching max level (50), you can no longer earn ability points. The amount of ability points you get is all you will have and you CANNOT unlock all of the abilities. Hence why your choices matter.

- Damage
Damage is split amoung different types now. You do not have a hidden blade to level up like in origins, rather a single value. The armor pieces you wear can increase the value as well as some abilities. But you will notice that the damage values are all on steriods. Enimies have over 100K health, Enemey Ships have over 500K health. Your damage for you ship is about 50K to start off with, and gets exceptionaly higher. However if you look at the health bar of your enemy, you notice you are doing the same amount as if you where in origins. So why are the damage values on steriods? To make us feel powerful when really nothing has changed?


- Bounty Hunters/Mercenarys
These enemies will be the single most annoying part of this game. If your bounty is high enough, a Merc (Mercenary) will be sent after you. Except the system is horribly broken. They will spawn 50-60 Meters away from you and auto route themselves to your position where they will attack you on site. Bounties will increase if you kill, or steal. Even when a quest has you defend yourself from enemies who start a fight, if you kill them, you get the bounty. If you decide to defend yourself from a merc, if you take to long, another will come along to join in on the fun. Soon you will find yourself facing 4+ mercs/hunters when it all started with one. You can pay off bounties from the Map screen but as you level up, the cost goes up.

- Quest within a Quest within a Quest
While the main story line does keep you interested, that is only happening if you are actually doing a main quest. More times than I can count the main story would have me do a side quest. Problem is that side quest has 3 quests of its own, and to top it all off, even some of those quests have their own to do. These sides quests follow the same pattern as any other side quest. Kill, Find, free X person/object. It feels like useless padding of the game when you are having to travel all over just to complete what started out as one quest and has turned into 10 of them.

- Enemy Damage VS Yours
Some targets and grunts can use Posion, and Fire. IF you are hit by their weapon you have the status effect immeditly applied. However when you attempt to posion or set an enemy on fire, you have to build up a meter above their head before it is applied. To make matters worse, if you have an effect applied by an enemies weapon, you take large amounts of damage to your health while if you manage to apply one to an enemy, he/she only takes upwards of 500 damage. Totally makes sense to have an enemy take 500 posion or fire damage every 2 seconds when he/she has 100K health.


I kept playing this game hoping it would get better. It didn't. Unless the cons are addressed in some way, avoid this game. If you want to still get it, wait for a sale first. It wouldn't be a ubisoft game without Digital and Gold packages after all.

10/10 will highly recommend this game at full price.

Pros:
- Fluid and strong land and naval combat.
- Map and environment is vibrant and full of life.
- Great and intersting story.
- Exploring Ancient Greece is fun and rewarding.
- Fighting mythical creatures.
- Makes use of historical events in games. (eg. plague of athens, battle of sphacteria)
- Bounty system is great. (I've not encountered the bugs that everyone's been talking about)

Cons:
- Tombs can be boring to explore as they lack the variety in AC:Origins
- Camps lack uniqueness and challenge in terms of size and enemies like in AC:Origins

Overall story: Okay

Gameplay: Amazing

Ending: 4 Possible Endings
Best Ending-Sub Par, short, no impact
Sad Ending-Okay
Worst Case Scenario Ending-Feels like a conclusion, has a greater impact
Secret Ending-Basically a big oof (Don't break your promise)

Overall Game: It's a good game but comparing to origins there's alot of pros and cons.

Buy during Sale

P.S Main Story takes 40-50 hrs to complete. Main story ends at level 42.

The first dlc, Legacy of the First Blade is really well made. The ending is a treat for people who have played Origins

Takes about 10-15hrs. Ends at around lvl 48
Each episode 3-5 hrs

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey begins more than 2,400 years ago at the onset of the Peloponnesian war: a decades-long struggle between Athens and Sparta for dominion over the ancient Greek world. It’s a fitting period to explore that’s rife with social and political intrigue, full-scale warfare on land and sea, and a tangible air of myth and legend. And after an astonishing 60-plus hours of galloping, sailing, and slicing through that historical-fiction sandbox, it’s easy to see why it was worth fighting so hard over.



Odyssey's world is the biggest and most vibrantly colorful of the series.
Odyssey’s world is the biggest and most vibrantly colorful of the series. Even though much of its playground is blanketed in the fickle blue waters of the Aegean sea, its playable acreage is immense and rivaled only by its sheer jaw-dropping beauty. Greece is a stunning series of picturesque locales: white-stone isles, eternally autumnal forests, sun-blasted desert islands, an endless expanse of beach, alabaster cities defended by titanic statues of bronze and stone, and the inviting, rolling waves of the open sea. These beautiful scenes explode into life thanks to a lighting system that still causes me to stop and snap a picture even all these hours later.

Of course, as with virtually all grand-scale game worlds, flaws lurk just under the surface. They range from minor immersion-breaking hiccups like draw distance that never seems to be quite far enough to capture the view, textures that arrive moments too late, or slightly off-sync audio, to the more severe: getting terminally stuck on geometry, finding an unlootable lootable item, or having your tamed beast become untamed when you die and reload – which may very well cause you to die and reload again if you happen to have had a tamed bear. Bugs like these were annoying, sure, but not quite frequent enough to sour me on exploring what has become one of my favorite open-world maps ever.



History / Herstory
For the first time in an Assassin’s Creed game we get a choice of whether to play exclusively as a man or a woman: siblings Alexios and Kassandra. True, as far as the story’s concerned they’re effectively the same character, but even though they’re superficial there are some meaningful differences. Namely, Kassandra’s voice acting is generally more consistently well done than that of her brother.

For that matter, accents and voice delivery throughout Odyssey are hit or miss, usually falling somewhere between good and outright scenery-chewing, especially when it comes to no-name NPCs who sound like someone who’d watched My Big Fat Greek Wedding once before being asked to do an impersonation. But the facial animation of the marquee characters is superb, and you can sense the subtle disgust or confusion on the face of Alexios or Kassandra without them having to say a word.

These protagonists are easily the most flexible characters in any Assassin's Creed game to date.
These protagonists are easily the most flexible characters in any Assassin’s Creed game to date when it comes to their personalities. As a mercenary, my Alexios was free to be whoever I decided he should be. A merc with a conscious, a one-track-mind horn dog, or a ruthless murdering psychopath – there are no wrong answers, but there were definitely consequences to the decisions I chose.



Most dialogue decisions usually don’t carry much meaning outside of whether your character is an upstanding person or a total ♥♥♥♥. For example, a desperate fisherwoman pleads to find her husband she fears was overtaken by pirates: I could agree to help find him for the sake of love and reconciliation and all the brownie points, or tell her I don’t work for free and watch her hopes dashed to pieces like the body of her former spouse upon the rocks. But some of those choices do affect the greater world around you: varied side missions become available according to your deeds, and certain characters could live or die – all the way through to the multiple possible endings. I never felt like I screwed myself out of something I wanted to do, but I had the freedom to be who I wanted to be.

I had the freedom to be who I wanted to be.
Who I wanted to be was someone who’s often too lazy or self-assured to hide his murderous ways, which put me in conflict with Odyssey’s new notoriety system. It’s a simple, common-sense approach: the more crimes you commit, the more likely it is that someone in the world puts a bounty on your head, and then a relentless cadre of procedurally named mercenaries begin to hunt and track you down.



While I initially found the mercs who were sicced on me to be little more than loot pinatas, as I leveled up the generic names and descriptors – like Ilona the Agile (who was admittedly quite agile until I sunk her vessel and she drown in the Aegean) – began to get more bombastic and threatening. For example, Mariah the Glimmering dogged me throughout my level-30s and her flaming spear and voracious pet lion worked in tandem to skewer or maul me into sweet oblivion on multiple occasions. I eventually just started running away when she had tracked me down, before finally ending her reign of terror some ten levels later. Sure, the loot wasn’t great, but it was worth it.

The mercenaries sent to kill me eventaully earned my respect.
With a high enough bounty, this endless procession of relentless pursuers began to show up in force to complicate matters while I was in the middle of sieging a fort – and before I could finish fighting one another would join, eager to hunt my head for coin. Then another, then another, and soon I had to choose between battling five headhunters while I tried to complete my objective in a defended fort, or turn tail and run. They eventually earned my respect, and I appreciate the chaotic X-factor they bring to Odyssey. Rising through their ranks to gain the attention of their legendary warriors is a fun meta-game in and of itself.



Similarly, the nation struggle system allows you to help the war effort for either Sparta or Athens in each region. By destroying supplies, pillaging war chests, or deposing a national leader, you’ll trigger a conquest battle. While these huge melee or naval battles are thoroughly excellent combat scenarios and reward you with some good loot, they mean disappointingly little to the story. Regardless of whether you’re attacking or defending, which side you join, or who ultimately wins, the war machine keeps turning. Eventually, I got to a point where I was able to weaken a region and trigger a conquest battle rather quickly, which made these mini-wars effectively farmable. That sucks some of the grandeur out of them, but seeing a hundred soldiers, captains, and mercenaries locked in combat is always a sight to behold.

Plying Your Trade
Weapons behave just differently enough for meaningful nuance.
Odyssey continues what Origins started last year, moving combat to a free-flowing dance of light and heavy attacks. The weapons are swords, daggers, axes, maces, spears, and staves, all of which behave just differently enough for meaningful nuance. In the heat of battle, it’s an easy-to-grasp system of slashes and skills, and I’m still picking fights just for the joy of it – especially against improbable odds, like the Greek legends of old.

There’s a staggering amount of equipment to find, upgrade, and engrave with powerful perks. Odyssey smartly offers you the chance to upgrade an old piece of gear to your level for a hefty fee, depending on its rarity. Thanks to that system, I didn’t have to say goodbye to my favorite sword and axe that I used throughout much of the adventure – but that attachment cost me a small fortune in resources to keep them up to date every few levels. But even if I didn’t always have the crafting materials or currency needed to upgrade my old reliable Spartan War Hero helmet to my current level, a constant stream of new viable gear continued to pour in, giving me options unt

Getting back into Assassins creed was a leap of faith so to speak, yes there's an open world to explore and yes there's fetch quests; and also "bullet sponge enemies" in higher level areas. It's not these things that make the game appealing in the long run, it's the amazing scenery and landscapes that really leave an impression for wanting more.

As of today, 3 hours played so far. I'm absolutely hooked. The graphics are incredible, the story is wonderful.
I'm playing normal and exploration mode, it's absolutely worth it. I'll probably notch up the difficulty as it's a tiny bit //too// easy for me.
Honestly, not on sale its worth it, on sale its also worth it.
I cannot wait to explore more of this game and what it has to offer. So far I am absolutely impressed and I love it.

The culmination of all the best parts of the other Assassin Creed games resulted in this epic, well-crafted experience inspired not only by their own games, but by the best in the industry.


Story
The writing and different dialogue options from The Witcher 3 are present. Narrative elements are definitely improved from previous entries, and the new writing team they have hired have done a great job, and it shows. Side-quests range from your generic fetch quests to actual hour-long stories with well-written characters, twists and turns. The story is especially long, but is interesting enough to warrant my playthrough. There is a great greek family drama to be experienced here, with some very emotional and dramatic events.


World/Graphics
The open world is enormous - too big in fact. Going from one place to another can sometimes feel like a chore, but every single area is filled to the brim with details, has its own artistic representation and feels different from others areas. The amount of effort here is outstanding and deserves praise. I still haven't explored the whole map after over 70 hours of gameplay, and I am not bored of it. Not to mention how beautiful the game always looks, day and night. Be ready to take amazing screenshots.

Gameplay
The gameplay is solid and is inspired by the Dark Souls formula, with the added mechanic of abilities like spartan-kicking your enemies and watching them fly off the edge of a cliff. There's a lot of variety here, especially since they added the ability to upgrade and drive your very own ship. Gameplay elements are abundant : sword-fighting, naval combat, stealth, bows, epic large-scale battles. It also heavily relies on RPG elements, like making sure your loot is up to speed with your character level, upgrading your armor and weapons, crafting, enhancing your items, managing your inventory, etc. They have also introduced a new mercenary system where these powerful enemies will hunt you down if you commit a crime, which can be fun since they always drop powerful loot. They have also introduced a system where you hunt down members of a cult after discovering clues hidden around the map. Lots of fun content separate from the main story really blows this game out of the water in terms of quality and variety.


Naval combat and exploration is a core feature.

Overall
Of course, like always, Ubisoft had to shoot themselves in the foot by adding some insulting microtransactions, forcing you to have to do sidequests in order to level up your character enough to be able to continue with the story. Although it's very annoying and deserves to be criticized, the game has more than enough to warrant your purchase, and really outshines recent Ubisoft games in terms of world quality, story and gameplay.

---{Graphics}---
Looks pretty good, areas start to look samey after a while but still good graphics all around

---{Gameplay}---
Solid, plenty of depth between the classes, quest structure is repetitive with padding added to make quests feel longer than they could have been

---{Audio}---
Audio is solid, plenty of queues and decent quality, music gets hella repetitive after a while.

---{Audience}---
This game is either for people who want a really long RPG to play, if you don't have time this game can feel very grindy

---{PC Requirements}---
Expect around 60-50fps if you don't have a strong pc build regardless of settings

---{Difficulity}---
This game's difficulty is determined largely by levels, anything at your level will be easy to fight, but you'll notice enemies even 1 level higher than you will be a bit harder to fight, enemies can feel very spongy when they are 2+ levels higher than you, unless you have a full stealth build then you one shot anything when not in combat

---{Grind}---
This game's grind can be pretty bad at times. You can tell the game was made and balanced around making you buy XP boosts. Without any boosts you can need as many as 5 quests per level which really adds up after 40 levels.
---{Story}---
The story is good, a humanizing tale about a greek peasant who ascends to greatness. There are 3 stories within the full game, and each builds on the character development from the previous ones. Much better than previous AC games.

---{Price}---
The game is worth buying at any price under 50 dollars. Though if you don't like long games you'll be hard pressed to buy the permanent xp boost for 15 bucks. this is by far the worst part of the game

---{Bugs}---
I have had some crashes randomly, no progress ever lost. other than that nothing to report sir.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the successor to last year's Assassin's Creed Origins and it improves on it's predecessor in almost every way. Assassin's Creed Odyssey now puts a much greater emphasis on role playing elements than it's predecessor. The game now has dialogue options, branching quests and multiple endings which can be decided by the players in game choices. Like traditional RPGs stealing and killing civilians will earn you a bounty which results in mercenaries hunting you throughout the game world. Odyssey now has a romance feature which allows you to develop romantic relationships with NPCs in the game.

Odyssey does a great job expanding on the RPG elements seen in Origins and also brings back a beloved feature from one of the previous games. Making it's return is the much loved naval combat from Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag. Just like in Black Flag, you are free to roam the world in your ship, which can be upgraded along the way. Using your ship you can take down enemies and board them in order to gather resources. This was something I loved about Black Flag and to see it back in Odyssey is amazing!.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is set in 431 BC during the midst of the Peloponnesian War fought between the city states of Ancient Greece. Players have the ability to choose between two main protagonists, Alexios or Kassandra. Both these characters share the same story so choosing one over the other will not impact the narrative. The story follows you attempting to reunite your family while attempting to uncover an evil cult called the Cult of Kosmos, who are attempting to take over the Greek world. The game's world feels and looks amazing. You have the ability to take part in massive conquest battles as well as join forces with Athens or Sparta. There are so many different locations in the game world and each has it's own objectives in order to complete that location.

Despite being set 400 years before the birth of the Assassin Order, AC Odyssey somehow still manages to feel like an Assassin's Creed game without Assassins. The familiar mechanics of AC are still here but this time the assassins do not exist. You don't have the iconic Hidden Blade but instead the Spear of Leonidas a legendary relic belonging to the Great King Leonidas of Sparta. The game's parkour and combat feel fluid and smooth and provides players with a pleasant experience while playing. Overall Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a step in the right direction for Ubisoft.

Verdict: 9/10 Fantastic!.

English is m second languige, therefore, I apologize if I sound like Yoda.

Good: After playing 16 hours I can say its not a bad game (first Assassin's Creed that I enjoyed in a long time). Good characters, RPG elements.

Bad: But after my 8th hour in the game, I forced myself to play it. The reason being is simple - level scaling (game world is very unbalanced).

I was able to turn level scaling off in AC: Origins, however, in this is not an option, trust me I tried. I contacted UBI and they lied to me that this feature can be toggled on and off in the gameplay settings. I searched yet was not able to find it. I searched UBI forums there were people like me. Then UBISOFT tried downplaying it by diverting attention to the difficulty setting however it still does not change level scaling. I wish I could return this game but its way too late for that. From hour 8 till 16 I forced myself to play this game hoping I get used to level scaling, however, I cannot do that anymore (I want to enjoy games I play).

Example: When I left Tutorial island Phokos was capped at 8-9 or 10. Now I'm level 24 and Phokos is at level 22, same as the tutorial island. I personally hate it. I know that there are people who like level scaling but I am not one of them.

Solution: Make level scaling optional like in AC: Origins

Verdict: For me, level scaling takes away the feeling of accomplishment if you like me don't waste your money.

Review: My Assassins Creed: Odyssey experience so far

The new Assassins Creed as a promised fullblown RPG game.
Which is set in the peloponnes war in greece (404 to 431 b.c.).
I´ve played almost every AC game, expect Syndicate. Because AC felt boring and out of ideas, gameplay wise.
But behold, Origins was a very good game, which I enjoyed to the end.

Now Odyssey picks the formular which made Origins a good game and mixes it with some new gameplay elements.
Decisions that really have a impact, for example.
I had to make a decision if I would kill or save a family that seem to have somekind of virus.
Of course I spared their lifes, just to see the whole land get plagued with their sickness, later in the game. I was shocked and amazed at the same time. I thought that my decision wouldnt make a difference in the Game.


World:
The Gameworld is larger and even more beautiful than the World in Origins.
It is packed with locations to discover, boss animals to defeat or beautiful cities to explore.
And dont even get me started with the sea which can be sailed with your own ship.


Combat / Gameplay:
The Combat is the same as you are used to AC games, expect the adition of “abilities” that can be leveld up and be used while in combat.
Its too bad that you cant use a shield like your enemies do.
Depending on the location where you are, enemies are on a higher or lower level than you are.
Which makes some fights really hard and challenging. Some enemies can only be slayed, if you have got a almost equal level as them. Just like in Origins.
The “God Challenges” and “Papyrus Riddles” from Origins make a return in Odyssey.
The Challenges are mighty and majestic animals that you need to track down.
But the “Papyrus Riddles” are only extra perks for your weapons instead of legendary equipment and weapons.
Which is kind of a let down.


Story:
The Story is interesting and versatile. I have played around 36 hours to this date of this review and it feels like that the story is almost as good as the story in AC 2.
Alexios (The protagonist) has character depth to him and even some humor, based on your answers to the NPC´s.
I am curious how long the Main story will take me to finish and how it will end.


Graphics:
The Graphics are just as good or even a bit better than in Origins.
The Lighting is vivid, textures are highly detailed and the performance seems good.
I get around 40-60 fps on a 1920×1080 resolution, with a GTX 1060 (6 Gb), at High to Ultra Settings.
But there is a problem with the texture streaming sometimes.
Some textures seem to take a longer time to load and appear blurry and messed up for a short period.

Conclusion:
A first review of this game, even if I am kind of early in the game.
The Story and gameplay is very good and just got some minor flaws until now.
Alexios is a charismatic and likeable guy, who acts based on your decisions.
The gameworld is vivid and one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.
Even if the Game has some Ghost Recon: Wildlands vibe to it,

I would recommend this game to every Assassins Creed fan or newbies to the franchise.

9/10

Odyssey is truly a long and adventurous journey


⏰ How long to beat Assassin's Creed: Odyssey:
- Main Story - 43½ Hours
- Main + Extras - 83 Hours
- Completionist - 137 Hours

By this point, this is the longest Assassin's Creed I've played to date, with over what I was hoping to be. The world itself is massive, and you will spend close to what I've spent, if not more, if you want to repeat the game on Game Plus on the other character (Kasandra or Alexios).

In the beginning, the game felt nothing like Assassin's Creed and the whole direction really left me feeling a bit empty as I didn't click right away with Alexios. It took me at least 50 hours into the game to get used to him and how he was as a character to later in the game actually appreciate, value and really like who he has become.

The main campaign was nice, but what really topped up my entire enjoyment was the DLC's that I will be talking about later in this review.

⚔ Gameplay:

🔲 It's a one-time experience
☑️ Only for achievements
🔲 If you wait a few months/years (try playing with mods)
🔲 Definitely
🔲 Infinitely replayable

The game contains a lot of side quests and side missions that will keep you engaged for over 150 hours if you're a completionist. If you want to replay the game, you can seek the Game Plus after you finish the whole game, but unless you want to see the alternative, I don't see why you'd want to do it.
The game itself expands on the previous instalment AC: Origins, intending to upgrade it. Unfortunately for me, I feel that Origins was a superior game in terms of gameplay as I enjoyed more the setting and the skills in the game early in the game.

😄 Fun:

🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry
🔲 Hard to enjoy
☑️ Repetitive
☑️ Actually pretty amusing
🔲 The kind of fun you'll remember
🔲 Ride of your life

As a big fan of the series and of the RPG genre, I can say that I have enjoyed this game more and more as deeply as I got into the game. I really believe that Odyssey needs time on for players to fully value the work Ubisoft has put into and ignore the fact that it no longer aligns with the direction once Assassin's Creed became.

It keeps the old elements of Parkour and assassinations but doesn't expand on them, yet this game really does a great job with the beautiful world and lore behind it.

If you love Greek Mythology, you will find this game fascinating to explore and enjoy. I know I sure did.

🏞 Graphics:

🔲 MS Paint
🔲 Bad
🔲 Meh
🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game
🔲 Good (nothing special)
☑️ Beautiful
🔲 Masterpiece

The graphics of this game are gorgeous, and I needed to upgrade my PC's CPU to play it to its fullest details fully. The world is gorgeously crafted, and I can't give credit enough to Ubisoft for the beautiful work.

🔊 Sound:

🔲 Makes your ears bleed
🔲 Bad
☑️ Not special
🔲 Good
🔲 Beautiful
🔲 Masterpiece

I felt that as the new RPG era progressed, the whole world felt a bit bland and not so much alive. I can't say that I fully enjoyed the music and the ambient sounds of this world, but it's not bad either. Voice acting can sometimes feel off, but that's because this game contains hundreds of characters that needed voice acting, and I can understand that this may be why sometimes it feels like it could have spent more time in the oven.

📖 Story:

🔲 This game has no story
🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story
🔲 It's there for the people who want it
🔲 Well written
☑️ Epic story
🔲 Masterpiece

Without spoiling anything, I'd like to point out that this game takes time to grow on you regarding the story. It does a great job at creating emotions between you and characters along the way, and with the 3 DLC's you are bombarded with beautiful finishing touches of the great story.

I felt most intrigued playing the DLC's because they were topping down on areas of the game that left me craving to know more about Alexios's story, and I appreciate that.

I can tell you that despite the criticism regarding the direction the game takes you, on its own, you will enjoy it. The most enjoyable part of all the other Assassin's Creed's I've played is that your decisions actually matter.

🧵 Length:

🔲 Long enough for a cup of coffee
🔲 Short
🔲 Average
☑️ Long (if u can even finish it)
🔲 To infinity and beyond

According to Ubisoft Connect 188 hours, the game took me, but Steam recorded 283. It's a long game, and at some point, it felt like it was never-ending. I thought I could finish it a lot sooner, but the long journeys between objectives and if you're a completionist like myself, you'll spend about the same time.

I wish it would be shorter.

💷 Price:

🔲 Free
🔲 Underpriced
☑️ Perfect Price
☑️ Could be cheaper
🔲 Overpriced
🔲 Complete waste of money

Depending on the Edition you want to buy the game under, it can get pretty pricy. I recommend getting the Ultimate Edition through a Sale, as it's a bit too much. Do know that by spending less than £40, you will be spending a lot of time in the game. If you love the world and all, you'll feel that the price for the game is just perfect as you got a lot of content to explore.

🧩 Difficulty:

🔲 My 90-year-old grandma could play it
🔲 Easy
☑️ Normal
☑️ Hard
🔲 Dark Souls (if u play with bell demon and charmless it's extremely hard)

At times the game can spike in difficulty, especially with the issue of Level differences. You will find yourself struggling with enemies that are levels above you, but as you get better at the game and unlock skills and better gear, you can expect to dominate the battlefield even when facing foes 5-10 levels than you.

I don't want to brag, but I have managed to defeat an enemy ten levels above me, with a few trials and errors. So, if you're persistent, you can do it too.

⚖ Pros & Cons:

➕ Pros:
+ The World is Gorgeous and you'll have a lot to explore.
+ If you're a fan of Mythology or Greek Mythology, you'll love this game.
+ The story with the DLC's are nicely written, even though it focuses less on the ideology of Assassin's Creed.
+ You get to have a lot of items and gear to mix around and play.
+ Some romantic moments here and there, and you can enjoy them all.

➖ Cons:
- It's not what Assassin's Creed used to be, and this may be a turn off for some fans.
- Too long; I really wish it would be shorter.
- The world and the people may seem big, but sometimes I wish the cities felt more alive.
- Voice acting can be quite poor at times and can kick you out of the emersion.
- I wish the main story Cultists were a lot more similar to what the DLC (Legacy of the First Blade) did to give them a lot more reason behind being in the cult; only a few of them get that treatment.

⚙ Bugs:

🔲 Never heard of
☑️ Minor bugs
🔲 Can get annoying
🔲 ARK: Survival Evolved
🔲 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

I've encountered a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing that would bother me. I've got a couple of crashes in my entire playthrough. I would think about 5-6 in total. Not too serious. The game sometimes gets overwhelmed and simply crashes for me. That was more often when my CPU bottlenecked my GPU.

⭕Conclusion:
AC Odyssey is a beautiful assassin's creed game that focuses more and more on the lore of the Cultists (Templars) and their origins. While AC Origins focused on the beginning of the hidden ones, Odyssey focuses more on the begging of the Cult to create a reason behind it.

If you want to explore a gorgeous world filled with mystery, mythology and magic, you may enjoy Odyssey a lot more than you think.

The game is good, the microtransactions are not. It's very obvious they designed they game so you should feel inclined to buy from their store. Shame since there is a really good game underneath all that!

لعبة ممتعة جدا بعد جزء Black Flag

هذا الجزء فيها تنوع في القصص

يوجد 3 قصص فرعية مرتبطة بالقصة الاساسية للعبة

فيه توازن بين القصص و الترقيات و المرتبات

كالعادة عالم كبير حيث اني ما دخلت 3 مناطق بالكامل

اللعبة سهله تقريبا توصل لرتبة 20 و معاك كل شيء اسطوري و تقدر تطور فيه الى نهاية اللعبة

ساعات التختييم تقريبا 50 ساعة للقصة الرئيسية

اللعبة ممتعة جدا انصح بالشراء

I have met so many people, gods, kings... The results will be different if I rule the world. I know, Ikaros, I know, I am tired now.
After I encountered so many epic pieces, I realize, eventually I am not just playing the game... is the love of Kassandra. The special K.

Nice works Ubi.

The good:
It's a beautiful game, the map feels large and rich with things to explore, and this is about as enjoyable as it gets.
Branching dialogue is also a nice touch, and your decisions can have consequences later on.

The bad:
THIS IS NOT AN ASSASSIN'S CREED GAME! It may be flogged as such, but the way you encounter enemies (be that by stealth or in a fight) is nothing like the assassin's creed games I'm used to (i.e. AC 1-4). Instead of focusing on being defensive, countering attacking against the various distinct types of opponent you're now fighting a sponge with a health bar, which arbitrarily gets higher with the tier of opponent, but visually looks the same.
There are no longer any visual clues about how tough an opponent will be. A tiny little guy (or woman, because according to Ubisoft apparently egalitarianism extends back in time) in a toga can shrug off an axe blade if they're a higher tier than you, that would fell (or at least do significant damage to) a guy who rivals Goliath for size and is decked out in full armour, just because he's your tier or lower.
But you get some absurd (...ly frustrating) situations, like being unable to assassinate someone of a higher tier WHILE THEY'RE SLEEP! Or shooting a guy 20 times in the face with a bow and arrow and he's still alive and chasing after you.
Then there is the dumb stuff like taking all the challenge out of navigating your environment. So you can climb ANY shear cliff/wall/100ft high bronze statue with such ease, gone are the days when you need to look for geometry (e.g. a window ledge) which you could grab onto. And while you take fall damage, you can't die from it, so you don't have to plan your free-running routes anymore, just hold shift and run in a direction and everything will work out.

I'm not against all levelling systems in games, but when there are 50 tiers and it's practically impossible to fight someone just 1 or 2 tiers higher than you (and for reference 30hrs in, I am only at level 15), just so Ubisoft can flog a premium thing to make you level up quicker, I think we need to not just accept that "it's part of the game" but ask why? Because it's a fun game mechanic, or to make you frustrated and hand over more money to Ubisoft?

As unfinished as the first assassin's creed was, at least it made more sense than this pile of rubbish does.
I'd give it a 3/10

Improving on the already masterfully made Origins by adding even more RPG elements like armour pieces and ability mapping as well as the much loved open seas sailing. If you loved Origins then this is a no-brainer must buy. If you liked Origins, but felt the RPG elements maybe weren't fleshed out enough than this is again a must buy. If you don't plan on playing this or you just haven't played the series since the Ezio trilogy than you've already given this a 0/10, but when you finally grow up and decide to think for yourself, then this game is more than worth your time

Funny how a lot of the negative reviews are based on 1-2 hours of playing the game. I am 20 hours in at the moment and while it is true that the original feeling of AC is no longer there it does bring something new and it is an Open world RPG. If you cannot accept that then you should have known based on Origins that this game was not going to be for you.

The game itself is great and offers a lot of features that make the world feel alive.
Easily you can spent 100+ hours into this game without ever being bored.
For me this game is a 10/10 because I know that I will get every penny out of it and enjoy it. Ubisoft has done an amazing job and I advice everyone that loves RPG's to try this out.

PLUS it comes with the Season pass

- LEGACY OF THE FIRST BLADE: Fight alongside the legend who first wielded the Hidden Blade to change the course of history.
- THE FATE OF ATLANTIS: Confront godly creatures and uncover the secrets of the legendary sunken city.
- AC 3 REMASTERED
- AC Liberation REMASTERED

Like bro. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ worth it. Don't you dare think something else!

Excellent title and addition to the franchise, however veterans of the AC franchise should be weary as many staples of AC have been long lost to time. Regardless, loads of content, good DLC and absolutely beautiful world and graphics.

Assassins Creed Odyssey picks up where Origins left off expanding upon the newly designed AC game play, this is no longer just another cookie cutter Ubisoft formulated franchise.

ACO follows the rich story line of Alexios or Kassandra depending on your choice with the other character mirrored as the main protagonists. The journey through ancient Greece is engaging through a series of complex and intertwining story lines of more than a half a dozen ally’s you form along the way.

Unique story and side quests with characters that come full circle and reinforce the main story and ideas of ACO rather than previous titles and franchises using the same remodelled quest formats that nobody has been interested in for the past 10 years. The main story follows a level system requiring you to explore and quest between major story arcs which some had dubbed as a “grind”, however, with the high quality of side content and quests this couldn’t be further from my experience.

The open world is truly one of the best open worlds in any game to date. Never once in any of the dozens of zones did I feel content was reused constantly or out of place with each area giving their own vibe and local. There really is just so much to explore and interact with as you slowly tick off points of interest and collectables along the way.

These are all significant steps above Assassins Creed Origins which already took the series to new heights and expectations after breaking the mould of a stagnant series and reinventing itself to a true RPG experience, providing just as many hours of game play after the main story is completed in about 50-70 hours.

Assassins Creed Odyssey is no longer a short story driven game with the open world just tacked on, it is a true RPG open world experience and rivalling in many aspects some of the best.

9/10

A really great game, that feels like Origins with allot of new stuff, which is a good thing since i really liked Origins.
The combat is more fast passed and requires dodging and parrying.
The exploration is Amazing, tons of beautiful locations and you get Naval combat and exploration from Black Flag, which is just simply amazing.
Lots of gear and skills customization.
And tons, tons things to do in this Huge world.
The only draw back for me was the story, you dont get that closure that you get in Origins. But here you have 3 different story branches. You will have to finish all of then to get ending for each branch. Which can take for ever. But that can depends on personal preference. Overall its a great game. And i recommend to for anyone to play it who liked Origins.
8.5/10

In Assasins Creed Odyssey, you play as the ancestor of a Spartan warrior.
The game features great graphics and a lot of very energetic fighting sequences.
I can only recommend this game to you because the story is on of its kind, it gives you your "family" story
back one by one, so that you can start to understand the whole story.
Get this game until it is to LATE :)

I couldn't explain to you just how much I love this game. The only downside that I have for it, is because of my own personal preferences. That specifically being, that I play a game for the story, or to play with my friends. This game I play for the story and the game DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE AN END. I am 36 hours in and it feels like I am only halfway through the main story. I don't really do side quests either. I chase after the story line with a lion like fervor and it JUST KEEPS GOING. Wonderful game, love it to death. Hope to see the ending before I meet my grandchildren.

Ubisoft lies again, they said about Odyssey:
“Since the story is choice-driven, we never force players in romantic situations they might not be comfortable with,” Dumont says. “Players decide if they want to engage with characters romantically. I think this allows everybody to build the relationships they want, which I feel respects everybody’s roleplay style and desires.”

And now they force Kassandra into a heterosexual relationship at the end of the DLC, even if you clearly choose to not romance the guy, even if you played the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game as a lesbian, and they even had the guts to call the success "Growing Up", because homosexuality is just a phase you know, and to become a "real" woman you need to get knocked up by some random guy.

They advertise romance in this game as something similar to BioWare games and now they pull that kind of ♥♥♥♥ , bait & switch at it's finest, I'm done with Ubisoft.

After completing everything this game has to offer so far I can safely say this is one of the best games I've ever played. Some people will complain about leveling but that's because they likely skipped most side quests. Had no problems with levels ever. Take your time to do everything and explore.. Game is amazing.

Incredible RPG, but if you're looking for more Assassin's Creed Lore, this doesn't have many of that, although the few bits it does have are very good.

If you love Greek Mythology, RPGs, Something comparable (although not better) to The Witcher Series in how good of a storyline/gameplay this is, then this is the game for you.

This RPG is def one of the best games i've played, and even though i might say this is in no way as good as other games like The Witcher, it's def still up there at the top and 100% worth playing.

Look at this as an RPG set in Ancient Greece rather than another Assassin's Creed and you'll most def enjoy this.

I haven't played Assassin's Creed since the original. I thought this looked quite different compared to the rest I've seen of the series. So I gave it a go and I wasn't disappointed. Gameplay is great, lots of side quests, armor, weapons. It's definitely branched out into an RPG and has a lot more depth than I was expecting.

the story is driving me so far it's really inspiring i can't wait to finish the game and explore it even more.

Amazing game. It really sucked me in. The battle system is a little spongey, but it forces you to analyze your talents and figure out different ways to beat your foes. The scenery is gorgeous, the story is captivating, and the music is phenomenal. Totally recommend.

If you liked origins you will like this one as well because its basically the same game just different story and location, Origins was a better setting imo but that about the only thing that was better. Oddessy is a upgrade in basically every other way.

I would recommend the game but there is a system that as you rank up , your enemies also rank up, and so at max you can have 3 level difference between your and your enemies rank. So enemies are not that easy to defeat. Its game mechanics is not same as Assassins's Creed Origins but this major thing of it I don't like. Anyways I love the game, bought a year ago, Thought of refunding the game after it got cracked , but i lost the chance . Please buy the game for supporting the developers and for showing your friends that how many games you have and for steam achievements.

Let me paint you a picture..

Kassandra, a descendant of Leonidas is exploring an island and stumbles upon a long lost tomb of Ajax,
When she stumbles upon a partially crumbled wall- She notices that there is a room behind the wall, and breaks through to find herself in a room untouched for hundreds of years.

As she explores the room, and follows the hallways connected to it, she finds nothing but vases with coin offerings, snakes and spiders; Until suddenly, she reaches what appears to be a throne room. On the throne, a skeleton. long-dead.
behind it, a stone slab telling an ancient story- and a treasure chest..

What did she find in the chest you ask? Well.. Garden Peas. She found Garden Peas in the ancient tomb.
To make matters more interesting, the description reads: ''Several vibrant green pods of FRESH PEAS that make for a deliciously sweet snack''.

Well done Ubisoft, well done.

I loved playing this game. It took a solid 60 hours to complete the game and that was only one ending, from what I believe there is another ending but I'll let you spoil that one for yourself. The game is creative and passionate about their combat system and the abilities you can acquire. I like how gory the game is and the different animations when you end a soldier. Besides the beast gameplay, there are some flaws to it as well. As you may know you can travel around the world by a ship but it'll take a while to get there. There are also some bugs but I don't think it has a big impact on the game. Therefore I give this game a big thumbs up!

20 hours in and I feel like I've done everything in the game. Very repetitive and watered down. Not worth 60 dollars when you can play origins and do all of the same stuff.

Purchased this game for $60.00 a year ago, now I can't play it because the UPlay account I registered this game to is deactivated. If I can't own what I purchase, then I won't be buying from Ubisoft ever again. What a garbage business practice. What a garbage company.

I studied Ancient Greek + Latin for 6 years in high school and all those myths, gods and monsters always seemed a bit abstract to me and inside this hazy head of mine, I could never seem to bring e.g. the Minotaur or even Crete to life. I simply could not do it justice.

That is why they've always remained merely "just stories" I would read about and translate. But oh boy, AC Odyssey embodies everything I studied; it's like the climax of all that I have learned for the past decade. Beautifully crafted into a single videogame.

From standing face-to-face with my holy savior Socrates to just wandering through historical sites I've only experienced in the magnificent opera - such as the likes of Herodotus and Thucydides - is a fantasy come true. It gives me chills and it's a surreal feeling because all the places seem incredibly familiar, in a way. It's as if I'm a Parisienne playing AC Unity: I feel right at home.

However, I can't help but mourn the fact that my classical studies teachers (who are your typical "what's a pc?" boomers) never got to witness this piece of art. Truly tragic. It should be mandatory for classicists to experience Ancient Greece in Odyssey (and make it to Sequence 9 ;)) before even thinking about graduating !!

The game itself is visual eye-candy and the world is accurately presented. This was my first AC game since Syndicate (then I took a break from the franchise). It is both refreshing and made me question the status-quo that I had in mind in regards to the whole series. Not once did I get bored. In fact, I enjoyed the "grind" most people complained about, simply because I was not in a rush. I took my time soaking all of it in.

The side stories albeit lackluster and predictable, still proved themselves a welcoming addition since they tend to keep my OCD occupied, along with the endless amount of explorable question marks scattered throughout the map. Playing as Kassandra was cool and felt natural. I grew fond of her in the end. The ending was perhaps a little weird and cringeworthy, but that's because I got the "good ending". Oftentimes Kassandra would act as the deus ex machina in sticky situations, but it adds to the charm of the narrative and setting, I guess.

Tl;dr: overall solid game that's worth your money if you're a Greco-Roman history nerd like me and into games that offer hundreds of hours of gameplay. If the game is on sale, do not hesitate.

EDIT: spelling errors.

Great direction for the series but poorly executed. Takes a step back from Origins.


They're trying to make a more RPG style game which I'm totally on board with but they've made a lot of bad choices. The talent system is weirdly dependant on how far through the story youve progressed which results in you not being able to level skills or abilities to match your playstyle. The map is similarly gated which is a necessary evil but it's wayyy too extreme. Naval battles are pretty similar to Origins with the addtion of some meh crew mechanics. I'm 20 hours deep and I've been forced to waste several points on skills I don't need and don't use.

The animations for this game are...strange. The female character is weirdly masculine because I'm pretty sure they've just reused the skeleton and animations from the male lead, facial animations are the usual disaster. Fighting and freerunning both feel slower and less fluid, it's awkward and there are a lot of mistakes. There are lots of terrain bugs and stuff you should be able to climb but for some reason can't. When sailing it's pretty easy to get stuck on the coast or have trouble turning around in the harbor. I haven't gotten trapped in any geometry but I've been killed several times because I leapt into a corner and then just hung there which is a staple of AC games but it's happening way too much in this one.

The story and dialog so far are a mixed bag. I'm not far enough in to really judge but the game hasn't made it very clear when you're making a big decision and when it's just flavor. The main characters so far are kind of meh and the voice acting is ok. I'm playing as Kassandra and so far she seems really shallow and I don't see much changing. She's also crazy aggressive with the ladies and ultra cringey. So far the absolute worst part of the game is the writing.

I'm not sure I'm sold on the gameplay loop which is funny because it's not very complicated. There's tons of busy work to do but it's not very interesting. Mercinaries is a bastard mix of the Phylakes and the Nemisis system and is so far completely useless.

Of course the game looks great. Running on Ultra it peforms better than Origins did on the same build and I'd say looks just a bit better. i7-7700k and 1080 both water cooled and I maintain a rock solid 60fps @2k. I get occasional tearing and I have also noticed several options resetting themselves.

Overall I like the ideas and RPG elements they're trying to work into the game but I wish they'd taken a year off and really thought about what they were doing and why instead of just cramming a bunch of stuff together and calling it a game. The gameplay is half baked and considering how technically similar it is to Origins the amount of things that they got wrong or got worse at is pretty amazing.



I'm sure they'll take care of some of my complaints with patches but unless you're a big AC fan wait for the Winter Sale. I was bored and had the cash but I'll probably get about 25% through this and then drop it for a month or two while they fix all the bugs.

The game itself is fun, like the other titles of the game.
Almost 2 hours in and I still enjoy it, can be a bit tough if you're not used to the controllers. So if you are new to this type of game I recommend you to practice the controllers a bit. The fightings can be rough. Still enjoyable though.

Open world for sure it is, as the previous titles, beautiful and fun with good interatcions with the surroundings.

A scale 1-10 I would give this a strong 7.

well to actually talk about Odyssey, i just gonna compare it to Origin because of how many thing Odyssey improved from Origin but also ruined thing Origin done right.
- The combat is vastly improve but they gave every enemy a skills now so all the merc and arena bosses you fight just not feel as special anymore, compare to Origin which only gave those special enemy unique atk pattern to catch you off guard. Some may think what Odyssey did gave you challenge but you can only fight the same kind of enemy so many time before you got bored and just use your strongest atk to kill them all.
- The world is way to large but lack in a way for you to fast travel, many time during my playthrough, i just leave it to auto-run then look at my phone. This is even more annoying because of the lack of fast travel points, unless Origin, there is no city or dock travel points so you often have to run around quite long time to get to where you want. Specially traveling on ship, there are many island so far way, sometime even over 6m.
- the large map also make travel through city or enemy's camp a pain since they will force you to slow down. While i can understand slowdown the horse speed in the city but why would you slow down the character's speed overall? that is what the crouch button for.
-The tombs are mostly copy/paste, only few in Atlantic actually have some pattern, they just throw in bunch of snakes and call it a day.
- You can mixed match the gear in this game and it is great but then epic gear are just recolor of normal gear and have better stats, instead of added new pattern on the gear to make them stand out than the rest of the gear like Origin. You may say it is easier to mixed gear set but instead of give them different material like in some low rank gear that let you switched from bronze to gold, but the epic gear just not feel as special.
- And speaking of gear, you can't buy any armor-looking skin for your horse from the shop in Odyssey (not count thing from the store shop), a lot of what you can get from the game are just re-skin of a horse with different effect like add a fire or shadow. It just look like you ride on a random horse instead of your trusted companion.
-They took out the "shield at the right time to counter enemy ship's arrows" so the ship combat is pretty much just you try to kill enemy first to recover some health and continue to fight other ship, there just no skill anymore and just how fast your arrow/spear can cooldown.
- The romance choice can be super weird since there are some serious conversation and you just "can i kiss you?" and since most of those option are just stranger you happen to meet that day, the romance option just not feel as impact or meaningful, unlike the first blade DLC.
- For some reason they decided to chop out eagle vision so they can put it in as skill slot even though the thing you need the most in this game, the diving skill got removed.
- Let you switch between gear load out but no skill load out, so if you actually want to build different loadout warrior/assassin/hunter. Then you have to switch your skills around to actually get it to work.
- And most important of all, there is no headgear during cutscene, there are many set just feel off without the headgear. Origin manage to improve the hood in cutscene with Bayek took his hood off during the scene he need to eat, drink or make out with his wife and even changed his voice if he wear full helmet. But Odyssey just throw it away because of "we want to showcase char's emotion" even though many headgear not even covered the face, it just sound lazy.

There probably thing i forgot to put in there but the game is clearly rushed with many thing just reused to saved time. Not to mention the game seem to forced itself into AC's lore and messed it up. If they actually make a different series instead, i would say it can became a really fun Greek game, just not good as and AC's game.

But if you don't care about the lore at all, then it is still hard to recommended this game,because while the gameplay can be fun, it will get really repetitive at some point. I personally think large open world game only fun when you have some kind of power to run around in it, instead of locked into one speed and have to wait till it reached the target.

As for why i complain so much yet still have ton of playtime then because i only play few hours a day so i can avoid feeling repetitive but that still not help after you reached close to the end and not much thing to do because all the running around to finish some quest line.

Mixed feelings about this game. It is good for the most part, but it fails to deliver in the most important aspects.
Odyssey is a big downgrade over Origins. Origins was excellent and revolutionized the series entirely, it was perfect in my opinion, but Odyssey is just a copy paste from that game with bad story and bad leveling progression.

Good things are:
Very good port. Runs at 1080p30/High (AA, AO, Volumetric Clouds on Low) on i5-8300H and GTX 1050Ti, 8GB RAM. Very stable, only a few rare drops on cutscenes. Graphics are incredible and very detailed.
It keeps all good technical aspects from Origins. Origins was an incredible game that revolutionized the series. Improved combat, dialogue choices, parkour, stealth approaches and RPG elements were great things that came with Origins, and they are exactly the same in Odyssey. If you like the way AC is after Origins, Odyssey keeps the same trend.
The map is really very big. There's a lot to discover and explore.

Bad things are:
There is no story basically. If you're expecting some Athens/Sparta story, just forget about this game. The game is just you doing favors for some random people in exchange of unacurate information and nothing more. Everything just feels like a side mission thrown at you randomly while you explore the world. And there is absolutely nothing about the assassins guild in this game, you aren't even an assassin lol
This game is very very grindy (much more than Origins). You need to spend hours doing side stuff to level up quite slowly. The gap between sequential story missions is huge, which is ridiculous. You need to level up like 5 levels until you can continue the story, forcing you to do A LOT of side content; The developer should've made story missions progress correctly to the player's level. Very disappointing, indeed.
It doesn't matter who you choose to side with in the war. You need to kill whoever is dominant in a region to complete locations and quests; if you don't do it, you won't earn XP.
Nemesis system copy (hunters/bounty) is incredibly annoying. These guys won't stop chasing you as they always spawn close, and they can ruin all your stealth approach or story missions because they are usually above your level and will always attack. Doesn't matter if you kill the hunter or not, your bounty doesn't lower and he get's replaced by another one instantly, even repeated guys start to appear lol

The developers increased the level cap and reduced the ammount of XP earned to force XP booster microtransactions making the game very grindy.
As the story is not intresting at all with zero representation of the assassin's guild and almost nothing related to the the history about Athens/Sparta, I didn't really feel motivated to spend hours slowly grinding levels by doing side content to progress the story.

The game is not bad, it's the developer's greed that ruined it.
Reduced XP and copy pasted previous game for quick cash grab.

Perfect case of quantity over quality
Long story short. There are over 30 regions in Assassins creed Oddysey but its a shame you do the exact same 4 activities everywhere

-Cities feel lifeless
-Sidequests are glorified fetch quests
-World filled with only forts and lifeless cities
-Combat is repetitive and spongy
-Resource grinding is slow
-Money is practically useless in a game where u are a mercenary with the goal of getting money
-Parcour went from a carefully designed world to you can literally climb anything
-I quit before i got to midgame but heard there is a giant xp grind to continue the main quest
-Assassinations aren't even a 1 hit anymore
-Optimized like crap
-Microtransactions to help u through the xp grind

The only positives i can note is the setting, cult system and the main story

Just give me a smaller world that is more dense with actual fun stuff to do and dont let me waste 30 hours 100% boring forts and looting chests for money that i dont have any use for

This was my first Assassin's Creed game ever. I really liked it! At first I felt kind of miserable because I tried to play it like The Witcher 3. Then I realized that it was more like "Breath of the Wild" on steroids; you can climb anything. The story was a good (a bit weak at some points though), but the writing was overall great. Most of the characters are really well-written, especially Kassandra. Best protagonist in a game that I can remember in recent years.

I could write endlessly about all the things in this game that annoy me after forcing myself to complete it but here are the big cons:
1. This is single-player game with no offline mode. Ubisoft Connect is currently down and I can't even launch the game. Do not pay for this game; do not support Ubisoft or its terrible business practices.
2. This game starts to feel like chore after a while, but at least when you do household chores, you have the benefit of a clean house. The story does not offer a satisfying pay-off at the end so unless you're really invested in the gameplay, don't waste your time.
3. If you have already played an AC game, do not expect new and improved assassination / stealth gameplay. It might be fine for a first time player of this series, but that's probably the only area that's been done more poorly. I thought it was a major disappointment.
4. The bounty hunter system means that you will have other mercenaries constantly homing in on your location. They'll see you, blow your stealth cover, and then have about 5x the amount of health of similarly leveled enemies. You can't assasinate them and even if you do, another one will just come after you until you pay off your bounty or run away for long enough.


The positives are that the world is very well designed and the open combat is more fun than previous games.

Running fine on my rig (i5 3570K GTX 1060 6GB) on high settings. The world is beautiful, the characters are away more interesting than in Origins and Kassandra is now my waifu.

So far so good. Good job, Ubisoft.

If a vast, beautiful open world, engaging combat/stealth, fantastic side missions and tons of activities is what you're looking for this game is worth a buy.

I loved AC4 and the fact that this game doubles down on the freedom of that game and removes the super annoying "real world" sequences and frustrating tail missions makes this game a vast improvement in my opinion.

While it retains many elements from Origins, it feels much more polished this time around. (Optimization could use a bit more polishing)

It's different enough that it feels like a fresh game, worthy of the many hours of my life I'm going to waste playing it.

Product refunded

Was pretty excited to play this game, but after an hour of gameplay it became completely unstable. PC should have been able to handle the game, but couldn't make it work. All other assassins creeds play just fine and even after doing a full clean up of my computer I was unable to correct it.

Thankfully steam gave a refund.

I wish I could write a better review on the game, but not with that little gameplay. The only thing that really bugged me with this game is they rewrote the controls compared to other AC games. Hard to pick up.

This game was waayyy too grindy, probably to push the in app purchases to boost XP or something, The story was okay though but having to grind sooo much to progress the story was a bit annoying.

To begin with, I must say I never got into the Assassin's Creed train from the beginning. The games just did not compel me to play them at all and they seemed a bit boring to me. The last game I touched was the 2nd game in AC line of games before trying it up again after so long with Odyssey.

I was blown away by how big the map was now and the controls now feel very fast paced and fluid even with a keyboard and mouse. The underlying tone of the Greek mythology was interesting and the game now seemed quite pleasant to play.

After finishing the game and most quests, I feel like I can add my own personal review of the game now.

Do note I played using an I7-8700K, 32GB of DDR4-3466 RAM, EVGA RTX 2080 FTW3 Ultra GPU and a Dell S2716DG monitor (1440p, 144hz, 1ms, TN panel, G-Sync)

Pros

- Game looks beautiful
- Fluid and fast paced roaming
- Easy to control and master combat
- DLCs are very interesting
- Ship combat wasn't too tedious and often could just be skipped
- Lots of places to explore, tons of quests to complete and bounties to do
- Gear can be upgraded with you if you do not mind investing materials in the process


Cons

- G-Sync seemed to cause screen tearing so I was forced to use V-Sync to prevent it but it capped my game to 60fps
- Some of the legendary monsters and hunts fights were a bit too hard even if you try lowering the difficulty (for me at least)
- Upgrading the ship fully required more materials that it feels like it should have
- Was able to tell who the Cult of the Kosmos Mastermind was midway into the game (but not the reasons why it was that person though)


To summarize, I would give this game a solid 9/10. I was quite surprised at how much I liked the Oddysey entry in Assassin's Creed line-up of games despite never having enjoyed the games at all before. I just wish they would fix the G-Sync issue to allow a higher framerate cap and buttery smooth gameplay.

Both my spouse and I are playing this game (me on the PC and her on the PS4) there is so much content that it is crazy, and the game even on easy is challenging.

UPDATE: I'm not a slow poke or completionists. And at 32hrs currently, I'm only just past what I would consider the beginning. There is no way I get less than 120hrs out this game!

Me a bit earlier: F* Ubi.im done with them
time passes
Odyssey shown at E3

"hmm... This looks interesting. But it's UBI so I will probably hate it."

game released
positive reviews start flowing
"man this does look neat. No self! Remember? F* Ubi. I'm not paying that much for a game that Wil be trash"

steam sale exists
"well.... I will try it. I can always refund if it sucks"

Me now: look Ubi, lets be adults about this. We both said and did things we didn't mean. So rather than squabbling about who was wrong, let's just make up."

Tl;dr - if you hate ubi, this is the game that deserves you giving them a second chance.

This is my favourite game in quite some time.

Tip - play as Kassandra

It takes a little to get used to the controls, but once you have it dialed, it's great. So much to do. So many different ways to get xp. So many places to go. There are some 'go deliver this' or 'go kill that guy' quests, but I think that every open world game has them and after a while, you learn you can ignore most of them. If you get bored of something, you have so many options of, 'Well, you know, I guess I'll just try this other thing for a bit then.' (Story, extra quests, legendary animals, mercenaries, Sparta V Athens battles, DLC, exploring, ship battles, collecting sets, etc)

I bought Origins (and others) after this, because people said it was better. I disagree. Odyssey is better in terms of gameplay, controls, story and voice acting. Origins and Syndicate felt like a chore to get through a lot of the time. Often it just felt a slog to get to 'the good stuff', or had these little added in time wasters that don't add to game play, but are there just so you end up playing 'longer'. For me, in Odyssey it felt like they instead added more content to make you play longer.

I also found the controls of Odyssey more intuitive compared to previous games. (I use a mouse and keyboard.)

I guess the best thing I could say, is that I bought this game on the summer special, where I got the platinum (or whatever) version with all the DLC for like $45cad. However, having now played it, I would have happily spent $100+ on this game....and am in fact looking at getting the next one on release because of the experience I had.

But play as Kassandra!

30 Hour REVIEW

If you were a big fan of Origins you're going to love Odyssey, it does more with the gameplay mechanic introduced in Origins and fixes some problems while not going far enough with some others

The game is huge, overwhelming at times. If youre the sort of gamer that wants to burn thru a game as fast as possible youre going to hit level walls that would require grinding unless you play as a completionist right away, and for some this is exactly the game you want, but if you plan on getting RDR2 in two weeks you better be rethinking it because this game will pull you in for 40+ or more, WORKING PEOPLE OUT THERE you've been warned, this isnt a bad problem and Odyssey does a good job at keeping you going

My thoughts

+Side Quests greatly improved with interesting characters (vs Origins)
+One of the best Stories in the series
+Beautiful game world, with great vertical elements and awesome underwater biomes
+Great Merc system (Similar to the Nemesis system in SOM/SOW)
+Addictive Gameplay with a abundance of Loot
+Large Scale battles are awesome
+Combat system improved, much faster pace and difficult

-Present Day storyline is lacking, (I loved the present day storylines from earlier games)
-Ship Combat isnt as deep as in AC4, probably due to the timeline
-Picking factions doesnt have any storyline impact, you pick who you like
-Hunting has a smaller impact in gearing up
-Level Scaling FORCED On (I personally dont like it, I want to feel OP when I head back to older areas, Areas with a certian level cap will increase with you based on your game difficulity but not match depending on their true starting level)

First assasssins creed game i played in a long time, if you are a fan of the assassins creed franchise for the "Hidden Blade" this isnt for you, but if you are just a fan of assassins creed AND RPG games, This is the PERFECT game for you. Whole heartedly do i say that this was the MOST fun game ive played in 2018.

Assassin's Creed: Odyssey released a year after Origins thus the first thing that came to my mind was that it was going to be a copy/paste of Origins but boy was I wrong. It's basically an improved versions of Origins that is bigger in scope. This time around you have the choice of playing between two characters Alexios and Kassandra. Kassandra is the better character to play as, mainly because I feel like her voice actress did a much better job than Alexios and the fact that it's more interesting to play as a female than the generic tough guy.

Odyssey is a very gorgeous and detailed game with a lot of things going on in the cities and villages to make it feel very alive and active. A couple of the music tracks give a Witcher 3 vibe, although i'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. Exploring on a ship feels nice but slow. The ship combat on the other hand I wasn't a fan of at all and avoided it at all cost. Microtransactions are present in the game, in the form of cosmetics, XP & drachmae boosts as well as map packs that add icons to your in-game map to make hunting for certain things easier. Honestly the cosmetics and map packs could have easily been part of the main game as rewards. The XP and drachmae boosts however shouldn't be a thing. The game is easy enough without them anyways.

As you would expect from a game of this size, it has TONS of exploring and quests. But for the most part a lot of the quests are bland fetch quests that serve no purpose other than to pad time. From my experience you can skip most if not all without being under leveled for the main quest line. However on the bright side there's a good handful of fun and interesting quests. The dialogue choices in most of the non-main quest line (and even some main quests) suffer from the Telltale syndrome. Where every option leads to the same end result or the choices doesn't matter in the end.

There's 3 main styles of combat in Odyssey. Hunter is mainly ranged abilities that use a bow. Warrior which is close-quarters combat and the stealthy Assassin. You can obviously mix and match your skills to either be jack of all trades or be proficient in 1 or 2 roles. The combat for the most part is really easy regardless of which route you take. Hack/slash, evade and repeat or shoot arrows and kite around your enemies while using your abilities whenever you have available action bar. Luckily the game allows you to easily reset your skills indefinitely so as long as you have the small drachmae it charges.

No longer do you have to worry about equipping a new and better piece or armor that would ruin the look you were going for! The game has a very nice system that allows you to change the appearance of any of your weapons or armor pieces, assuming you have looted the armor piece or weapon in the game world. The system keeps track of everything you have looted so far as well as everything available in the game. Although don't expect every item to have a unique look. Most of the items have small differences from one another, while a small few are fully unique.

Despite the size of the game, at times it can feel somewhat lifeless. Apart from the occasional frame drops in some crowded areas, the performance is smooth otherwise. There's some minor glitches, but nothing serious or game breaking. I recommend you play the game with a controller since it feels more natural. The problem with using a controller is the bow aiming, but can be fixed by enabling lock on. It's a bit cheaty but you're pretty much OP for most part of the game so it really doesn't matter in my opinion.

Pros:
+ Interesting story & setting
+ Lots to do
+ Male & female protagonists
+ Very gorgeous and detailed

Cons:
- Microtransactions
- Repetitive and grindy (at times)
- Ship combat & exploring

SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT - NO, REALLY, SPOILER ALERT -

Combat and stealth are fun and can be fulfilling when you successfully infiltrate a fortress and complete your objectives and slip away unseen.
However, the RPG elements are poorly implemented and a huge letdown for me.

I wanted to roleplay an embittered Kassandra: who no longer considers herself a Spartan and accepted a life as a mercenary. One whose life was dictated by that one moment on the mountain -and getting thrown off.
When you finally confront the man who threw you off said mountain I merely wanted to return the favor; but the game would not let me. Instead she releases him and seems conflicted about her revenge (no no no no; just [Spartan-]kick him off the ledge already !). When he mentions he loved both Kassandra and her brother, she snaps and runs him through (right, that apparently was the straw that broke the camel's back; I mean really?)

There is spoken dialog in a cutscene of how you wished you had finished off a certain character -and when you finally have a confrontation with this person, my character starts to apologise and couldn't we all be friends. WTF?
When I get a chance to say I'm no longer Spartan. mother says otherwise and I immediately agree with her.
I play several missions a specific way that will rub someone the wrong way; but I just don't subscribe to their suggested path. When my character gets berated, instead of justifying herself, she starts a rite of contrition.

Every possible path that seems to divert from the middle of the road experience, is somehow automatically funneled back onto the main road; as if the game wants you to tread a single path that was laid out by the designers of the game. The illusion of choice is just that: an illusion -and a bad one at that. My suspension of disbelief quickly became just disbelief.

When my character berates Barnabas -the captain of your ship- for being too looselipped towards a stranger (who turns out to be Herodotus), the next sequence that plays out leads up to some major silly if not stupid dialog: my character does not wish to divulge anything they've discovered to Herodotus and he calmly explains that while there are many people who cannot be trusted, he is not one of them -okay, so my character immediately does a 180 degree turn and trusts him implicitly.
Also, apparently the best possible ending is when everyone of your family -old and new- are spared/saved; WHAT?
Nikolaus chose duty over his family and for me that warrants no happy end for him; his newly adopted son is a devoted fool who -as far as my character is concerned- can share his step-dad's fate.

When in Sparta before the two kings I wanted to tell them to take a hike and that I would see Sparta be brought to its knees; instead I have to fulfill some lame quests to reclaim the old family house -I would've rather torched the place down.

Throughout the game my Kassandra was dancing a routine that was choreographed in total silence and then had a strangely chaotic instrumental track tacked on, showing a performance that was both out of sync and coiling around itself, constricting and choking the very life out of it. It feels like a roller coaster ride that -instead of being fun and thrilling- leaves you nauseous and reeling. Opening Pandora's Box would probably have been a good thing, if it meant a game-over screen.
All of my character's motivations seemed one contrived contradiction after another.

The game would've been more coherent -and consistent- if my character's replies and responses were all of the same vein. And not veering off on a very promising tangent, only to make a U-turn and return to the inconsistent swamp where you slowly but surely get mired down.

And the game would have been so much better if you could actually make deliberate choices that would steer you either left or right -and not all just filtered down the middle. It's like watching grains of sand passing through an hourglass.
Over time I became less and less involved with my character, until I eventually stopped playing.

So, in a nutshell -or straightjacket- combat and stealth: excellent.
RPG elements / dialog choices: a jumbled, inconsistent and contradictory mess.
A slightly buttered scone, but eventually not my cup of tea.

What a game! I extremely enjoyed this game and the 90+ hours I have put into it. I believe that the Assassin Creed series is heading in the right direction as this is a big improvement since syndicate and unity.

The game itself is huge. The map consisting of the Greek Islands is incredibly expansive and I have had a lot of fun exploring each area. The time period that this game is set is something that really interests me anyway. The history, architecture, military, mythology etc. are only some of the things I can list that have drawn me further into this game. The RPG genre that Ubisoft have adopted now I think personally has moved the series the right way. The ability to change weapons, gear, upgrade your ship by collecting materials is truely a lot of fun. The story is good. Some parts were sometimes lack luster but overall I was interested in the development of the characters. The addition of the historical figures was something I liked. Seeing these idolised people either through quests or lore defined the game further.

The land and naval combat was nice. Land combat with the use of the ability tree I had no trouble with and I thought that the different trees that you could explore into gave a lot of freedom and would allow you to approach your own playstyle. Naval combat I reminisced with Black Flag. Love boarding other ships and also ramming boats in two was brilliant. The level and material system personally for me not an issue. I didn't have any problem with levelling up and I didn't necessarily have to grind. Other features such as the mercenaries tab and the cult of kosmos I enjoyed working through.

My only downsides with Odyssey is a couple of things. Some of the quests were a little repetitive in the sense of basically doing the same thing. As I played as Alexios, I felt his dialogue could've been improved with a little more emotion and facial features.

Overall this is my game of the year no doubt about it. I have really enjoyed playing this game and it makes me hopeful and excited for future content that Ubisoft plan to create. I highly recommend.

9 / 10

Literally just came here after writing a negative review for AC: Origins. It make me realize just how good AC: Odyssey was, and that I must shout my love to the world. Rarely can I play a game for more than 100 hours without losing interest. Dude? I was so sucked into this world. Stunning. Such a major improvement from every other AC game ever made. I keep playin em, despite having never had a high opinion of em. Highly recommend this game, so much fun.

Also, the Fate of Atlantis DLC is some of the best DLC I have ever played. Maybe tied with Witcher 3's Blood and Wine, actually. I had no idea what I was getting -- it's gorgeous, and it has a lot to offer. You really get so much out of it (I probably spent 30 hours on it??).

My only complaint, which is the major complaint I have with all AC games, is that story & characters are yet again lacking, BUT I found it to be a huge step up from previous games!

I would love nothing more to play this game. checked specs weeks ago everything was good. 2 days before launch ubi decides to update system specs without telling anyone. Now countless people are out because ubi decided to use AVX. How can every other AAA title be played on my pc in high to ultra settings yet no ac od? This was very decpective business practices utilized by UBISOFT. Wait until all the pre orders come in then change your specs? Beyond Deceptive shame on you ubisoft. Steam better be prepared to refund ALOT of purchases.


Update: Thank you ubisoft for the fairly quick patching of this problem. This game is everything i wanted it to be and more. Next title you release please make sure its 100% ready at launch.

Alright, having played 173 hours and completed 90% of the achievements, I can gladly rate this game an 8/10.

It's gained a lot more RPG elements (the type that require you to grind) since the older ones I've played, although that change is welcomed. I like that you can customise the visual appearance of gear, although the feature isn't as robust as in a game like Diablo 3.
Having the main story lines (plural because there are many that contribute to the overall "Main Story"), as well as the DLC tie strongly into Greek mythology as well as history is fun and exciting, as you end up learning more about the Theogony than you would from most media. The real world plot is also good, as it's escalated a lot since Black Flag (my last AC game).
tl;dr
Looks great, plays great, lots to do, lots to learn and lots to feel :(

One of the most desirable versions. The Assassin's Creed Unity make me boring, but the Odyssey is different.
Pros:
- Fun......!?!?
- Stunning graphics
- Bassic Parkour.....,but its ok for me.
- The biggest map in the series!
- Awsome characters!
- Story = 8. AC2 still best story ever.
Cons:
- This game is really heavy, you need a powerful VGA like Gtx 1080 to have a smooth 60 fps experience.
- Combat is hard.
Ok!!! I suitable AC Oddyssey only after AC3
Score: 8.5/10

Whether or not this is the best game in the series it's sad that i payed full price when this was launched blinded by the ign and steam reviews.

Problems:
1. Side quests are forced to complete the main quest (which is quite interesteing although no masterpiece) but as soon as the joy of riding your house and the combat system (which is pretty solid minus a few flaws) wear off you realise there's no backbone and its point a to point b with no substance.

2. Combat is initially fun and i had mine set to hard and confidently say it is completely ruined. The damage enemies deal and damage you deal is petty. Having been used to dark souls 2/3 hit kills would be perfect and fair but instead it takes you about 5 hits to die and you can easily heal within combat. The worst however is that your weapons are so flimsy you pretty much have to hit a regular enemy with 30 hits (about 10 combos) before killing him and this isn't even a joke unfortunately. So when you are facing 3 enemies good luck finishing them off in under 2 minutes. In fact this is the worst when it comes to legendary animals on hard it is laughable spending 15 minutes fighting a 'boss' with about 3 different uninspired attacks.

3. Armour and weapon system is a shambles. I love collecting good armour sets then not having to worry about my gear for the next 5 or so hours, unfortunately here you just pick up and roll with whatever set happens to be the highest level. So that nice shiny legendary sword you just got will be used for a single level before being cast aside. Want to level it up to keep using it? Well good luck paying the massive price to level up and customise it for a single extra level before its once again thrown out. I love that feeling in witcher 3 and skyrim when you just got that new weapon/armour set and you feel at your strongest before in another 5 hours of gameplay you replace it again. Here its just frustrating to have to keep upgrading i would have even preferred no armour weapon/system where everything just levels up itself it would be still poor but less tedious than the current system.

4. Microtransactions are awful. I find it sad that people pretend this didn't happen as if they didn't find a way to insultingly jam pay-to-win into a singleplayer game. Microtransactions for cosmetics are bad enough for a completionist when you just spent £60 but paying money to avoid tedium is some free to play mobile game scam not triple A.

- Tamed a bear.
- Equipped a weapon that increases pet damage by 100%.
- Deployed said bear into an enemy stronghold.
- Sat back and relaxed as the bear took out every last enemy for me.

10/10 would do again.

The game is great and it's clear that a lot of work has been put into developing it, however it's a single player game that costs 60 Euro and if you want all dlc you need the season pass which is another 40 Euro PLUS a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ingame store. Ubisoft are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥.

Honestly one of the best games i've ever played.There is plenty of side quests, armour sets, weapon sets,huge and beautiful world etc.I will admit this game does not feel like a traditional assassin's creed game , but as an open world rpg with lots to explore, this game definitely hits the mark in that aspect.

I recommended this to my friend as the refinement that AC: Origins needed, with better story, better characters, better environments, et cetera. But now that I'm in the late game and it's 70 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hours later, I am nothing but frustrated with this beautiful looking chore. It's like having to take out the garbage every hour in a beautiful Norwegian landscape. I mean yeah, it's gorgeous, but that's kind of lost on you when you have to take out the garbage for the 48th time in 2 days.

I really want to like this game. I tried really hard to like this game. Initially, I did like this game, and I enjoy how beautiful and faithfully recreated it is. The opportunity to stroll through Ancient Greece is a historical wet dream, but it just cannot seem to stop getting in the way of me having fun with it. It's too busy either: Padding out quests to ridiculous amounts, or a level scaling system that's supposed to 'challenge me' the entire experience through. But the only thing it does is make me infuriated that the region that had level 19 enemies the last time I visited suddenly got upscaled to level 41 to match my current level, and takes away all sense of progression. You feel like you constantly hit the same weak blows the entire game through, because you don't encounter lower level enemies literally anywhere because they get upscaled. Higher level enemies suddenly feel like absolute tanks even when they're just a level above you in the ~40 range because you haven't found any good gear recently to make you viable and it just serves to make the entire game feel too long, too tedious, and too irritating. In order to stab a guy to death, you need to critically assassinate somebody and while I understand what they're trying to for here, you need to walk up into range, hold your weiner for about a second until you can use the charge-up prompt to critically assassinate somebody, and then hope in that time nobody has come past or the guy you're trying to stab didn't think to turn around in the meantime. I don't know how they managed to mess up assassinating in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Assassin's Creed but my god they did it. The solution in my opinion is that you could charge a critical asssassinate on the approach with the exact same prompt, much like you can charge a heavy attack in combat. But god knows that would make too much sense.

And the quests are some of the most runaround nonsense I've ever seen. I appreciate what they're trying to do with the story but the entirety of Episode 6 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ padding.

>You're back in Sparta. Cool, we want our house back.
How do we do that?
>Do these two things for the kings.
What things.
>Help in conquering Boethia
How do you do that?
>Travel there
>Kill these four champions
How?
>Do minor sidequests to get access/advantage to these four champions
Ok, now what?
>Kill all of them individually.

And that's just the one thing. You need to do some nonsense with the Olympics in this episode as well, only to end up tying back to getting your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ house back 5 hours later. Maybe this is an effect of me making a poor decision earlier and if it is, I'll own to it. But this is fluff. It's retarded, irritating, unnecessary fluff. And there's already so much fluff in the shape of sidequests. I didn't think I'd ever level the critique of there being too much to do in a game, but there is. There is too much ♥♥♥♥ to do and it's all incredibly uninteresting. Pair this with the ♥♥♥♥ progression in terms of combat and sense of power that you get from this shoehorned RPG system and it's just frustrating. The flow of just meandering into a camp and stabbing everybody in sight like you could in the older Assassin's Creed is replaced with having to hold your ♥♥♥♥ for a second every single time you want to stab the ♥♥♥♥ out of a brute because their HP bar is an arbitrary number and your own assassin damage arbitrary number isn't big enough.

All in all I can't say I have genuinely loathed a game as much as I do this game, especially not which is perfectly competent, and beautiful, but which is it utterly and totally mired with such stupid design decisions that it takes away any sense of wonder and enjoyment long before the end comes. I love Kassandra as a character, I love the improvements they made on the story from Origins and I absolutely love how they manage to make this ancient world come to life. Again, I really, really want to like this game. But I just can't. It's just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tedious. It's not even boring, it just takes too long to make the story get anywhere, and in the meantime you'll have played 50 hours of monotonous, same-y combat that feels exactly the same as it did on level 2 as it did at level 44 with absolutely no feeling of change or increase in power. You're gearing up to stay relevant, not to get /more/ powerful.

I am so incredibly disappointed.

This game is beautiful and fun as hell for the first 25 levels. That's when the grind begins. I don't mind, and even enjoy, a certain amount of grind. But this level of grind is a game breaker for me. Despite breaking down virtually all non-legendary gear and buying materials from blacksmiths, I never have close to enough material to keep my legendary equipment current. To upgrade a legendary torso to level 38 costs 442 iron, 885 Soft skins, 133 obsidian glass and 8846 of the currency. It's the same cost regardless of whether you are upgrading a level 16 torso or a level 37 torso. You get soft leather by hunting animals and a deer gives you 3 soft skins. Even the larger and less common animals such as the lion or bear only yield between 10-15. You do the math. It's a brutal grind.

The RPG aspects of the game are strictly based in the gear the character wears. We invest time and resources kitting out our gear to develope a character and then are forced to wear other non-legendary gear that may or may not fit in with the RPG character we have developed. Or . . . we can pay real money for resources. I mentioned earlier that a level 38 torso requires 885 soft-skins. It will cost you $10 to get 420 soft-skins, 420 iron and 14 obsidian glass. $10 will not get you enough materials to level a 38 torso! Including weapons, we wear 8 items, and I've only talked about the torso, admittedly the most expensive piece to upgrade.

I'll keep my eye on the game notices to see if Ubisoft makes any changes, but I'm done.

My favorite games are RPGs and when I purchased this game, I did not anticipate that Assassin's Creed Odyssey would tap into that genre quite so thoroughly. With beautiful scenery, vivid characters, and enjoyable combat (including naval battles), I am thoroughly obsessed with this game. I would strongly recommend this one for any RPG fans.

Not an Assassins creed game anymore, but has a good story, if you can ignore the grind, the game is actually good,
Not a bore fest like origins was.

This series tends to get more and more like Mass Effect and less like Assassin's Creed. Still, a very ambitious and well done game.

This could as well be a compleatly seperate game from the AC series. This has so little connecting itself to the AC universe the things that do connect seem more like easter eggs.

Game itself just poorly done wannabe RPG. Super boring gameplay, I don't believe I will ever finish this title.

Would not really recommend to anyone.

Honestly one of the worst AC games. The story is super fragmented. And in order to complete the "main" story, you have to buy the DLC.

The "episodic" release of content is a new idea for single player games. But it really makes the pacing of the game feel very off to individuals looking for a simple linear story.

Do you want to get into Atlantis? you gotta buy the DLC.

I think is game improves on AC Origins, but this game is more of the same but changed certain aspects, the setting and gameplay is simply amazing to explore and the game is less of the empty feeling, much to play here with the content provided. if you like origins you WILL like this one for sure! recommended to ac fans and people who like open world rpgs.

THEY FINALLY GOT IT! I can't believe how many years have passed waiting for an amazing assassin's creed game to play, and they have finally done it. Yes, it is true that the game has changed their line with the assassin theme but it had to be done. You can't always give the assassin content expect it to be sold gargantually every time. So it is very good to see that the gameplay and story has improved so much considering the other games like unity and syndicate. Graphics are ABSOLUTELY GORGEUS. Well done Ubisoft, well done !

Dont no from where to start, I was so inspired for game hardly wait to comes out and is worth every penny of it, got deeper mechanics then AC Origins, bigger map and game is huge I already play around 30 hours and I am nowhere near to end. In general game is not much changed from Origins, just deeper and more rpg, while Origins was more like GTA.
I actually see here many stuff similar to Middle Earth Shadow Of Mordor, mercenaries is put in same list like captains there also happen same thing is try fight them all, they come more and more so in this kind view this game is more for "Assassin style" compare to Origins(for me this personally this is not so great but some people who love this style will love it).
Ship battles here not so good and deep like in AC Black Flag but is good enough and specially this crew and recruit system is great it helps a lot also make game much better.Also pet taming is much better then in AC Origins, pets return on max HP after battle end, that make it more usable, and skill system give much more personalization for play style. I recommend this game for anybody who like open world and rpg games.
Game got and some bad sides anyway, on visual aspect is just more grey then AC Origins colors not so beautiful and bright, graphics almost similar maybe improve some textures , but just not look that great like Origins who was mindblowing(I didnt see any game look like that).And here again this AC Odyssey become even heavier then Origins like system recommendation, little bit improvement on some way then Origins awful town performance but still unstable and really heavy(this game is heaviest from all at the moment, there no else such demanding game, so must have good system if want play this, I recommend at least GTX 1060 for 1080p Medium-HIgh for 60fps and that is not constant if want plat on max on this resolution need GTX 1080 at least).And last bad thing what makes me impression is world, most towns and wild locations looks almost identical that is a shame is just not so varied like was in AC Origins, here if put me in some town I really cant tell what town this is because look so similar, same for wild locations.
Either way game is amazing gameplay and world is so complex, there is just few titles who can come near this game so my rating overall is 9.5/10

THE GOOD

Graphics, even at low settings the game is beautiful

Environment. ambiance, historical locations

Story

Cut scenes

Quests

Areas keep pace with your level and it's configurable

Good difficulty options

Melee, ranged and stealth combat. It's not overly complicated

Sailing and ship combat

Mercenary system

Cultist system

Crafting. Enough options to keep it interesting

Sound and Music

Some free content updates even without the season pass

NPCs

Being able to climb just about anything

THE BAD

Getting stuck on small objects as if you where climbing them

It's a bit too easy to run into a restricted area by mistake and get attacked by the guards.

There's an awful lot of yelling going on the ship.

THE INDIFFERENT

Two character options with no customization

Generic non intractable NPCs do not speak localization language

Tamed Pets (when they aren't in the way, lost, getting non intended agro, or not entering an area) they are actually good once buffed

Every Assassins Creed game I played is a masterpiece.
Nice story, excellent graphics, brilliant atmosphere that immerse you into the ages of Peloponnesian Wars
One thing that is new in this game, is navy - birreme. Driving the birreme through the see and the sound of the see makes you very relaxed and joyful.
The beginning of the game is somewhat boring, but it gets more and more interesting as you play.

Definitely recommend this one.

Not being an assassin, but mercenary adds a lot of RPG variety & immersion IMO.
Huge and diverse. Better than Origins in almost every aspect.

Pros:
- RPG style Assassins Creed
- Amazing graphics
- Easy combat
- Conquest battles
- Fun naval combat
- Good Mercenary system (an improvement over AC origins Phylakes system)
- Customizable outfit, gear, horse skin, ship skin etc.
- Amazing soundtrack (but I guess that's not why you wanna buy this game)
- Decent story but doesn't quite feel like an Assassins Creed game

Cons:
- Side Missions are very repetitive (for eg: STOP asking us to get 3 seals from Spartan or Athenian generals 8 billion times!)
- Selecting one opponent system during combat is broken, frustrating and stupid
- I'm almost at my target location by the time Phobos arrives (the stupid horse gets stuck behind everything)
- riding Phobos in cities, town, villages or any sort of restricted areas is frustrating because the horse basically starts jogging slowly
- The game still has a ton of stupid collectible treasures which are repetitive and do not provide any good gear. The only time these treasures are worth opening is at the beginning of the game when the main character is not developed enough. After level 30 or after the completion of the main story these treasures are worthless and only serve as area completion objectives.
- worst voice acting amongst all AC games.



Would I recommend it?
Absolutely, despite of it's shortcomings, the game is still a ton of fun.

I like this game. It has it's flaws for sure. But as a Greek I can say that the look of the hills rocks and mountains are really close to real life . The world is alive and really beautiful , especially the cities but you can't react with it a lot. It's just there. The quests are repetitive and sometimes really tedious. The combat is a bit boring sometimes but most other times it can be fun when you hack and slash while trying to dodge. Nothing challenging though. Stealth was an interesting approach but it can get really boring really fast. The main story and some side quests were interesting to follow but I never felt engaged in them too much. Overall if you are willing to see past all it's flaws it's an enjoyable game.

Beautiful adventure with loads of stuff to keep you busy for quite long time (exploring, questing, and fighting; land & sea). The environments within this game are truely breathe taking and believable. This adventure also has an epic tales (mains & side quests) which your every choice (decisions) you choose will effect you and the world as a whole. During your travels you can meet up with some interesting characters along your adventures some famous and not so famous from past history in this game; each with interesting stories of their own. I really enjoy my time within this game and think you would too.

First off I have to say nuts to the reviewers who said this was a "good RPG, but bad Assassin's Creed game." I heard that phrase tossed around A LOT while reading and watching reviews about AC: Odyssey and looking back now, I am annoyed by that sentiment. Having played so much of it now, I think people said that just to sound clever because it is one of those phrases that MASKS itself as clever by saying one positive thing about a genre and one negative thing about an entire franchise, so it almost sounds believable.

I'd say they're horribly wrong. This is as AC as AC can get with how your main character, whoever you choose to play as, has a friggin Piece of Eden with them at all times, first of all, and second of all, if these people paid attention to the cutscenes, particularly the ones in Athens, the supporting cast as subliminally training you on how to become an assassin in terms of how you conduct your business. Yeah, sure, you're a mercenary in Ancient Greece who also happens to use stealth, but doesn't use a hidden blade. Fine. But again this is a pre-prequel to Origins and you are playing the precursor to what would later BECOME assassins.

Not to mention we finally have a 3rd person to see the modern story through, and although she's kind of boring, it's a nice step in the right direction after all these 2nd person experiences that felt disconnected even though the modern era characters were addressing you, the player, directly. We just need a better modern era character to play through who is actually an assassin descendent and it would literally save the entire modern era part of the franchise, I don't get why Ubisoft doesn't see that. Did they forget how awesome Desmond Miles was as a character?

Anyways narrative aside, I can say with absolute certainty this is one of the best Assassin's Creed games I've ever played. There's a lot of systems to get acquainted with and it is overwhelming, but overall I think this is the best gameplay an AC game has ever had so far. The combat has been reworked to be more challenging and engaging, along with ability oriented that you can develop through the RPG levelling system.

The stealth is still pretty good, but I don't like the overuse of bushes for this, I miss just peaking around walls like in Unity and using hay bails. It's also not as satisfying to use a broken spear instead of a hidden blade. The animations could've been cleaned up too, I hate seeing the weapon missplaced in the enemy from where they actually bleed and got stabbed from. I don't get why Ubisoft opted for this loose way of handling animations because in earlier AC games iirc, the stealth kill animations had the player and enemy locked in a fixed animation together instead of two animations happening at once by two separate sprites.

Otherwise the stealth is still good with the air kills, the wall kills, and despite my hate of bush overuse, I do love me some bush kills where you take the enemy into the bush, kill them and then BAM no need to carry the body and hide it somewhere, your kill does that for you.

Ever since it was introduced in ACIII I kind of hated the naval battle system. I just feel like it's a whole different game, but I can see why people like it. This time around you can upgrade the hell out of it and I dunno, docking other enemy ships should've been done better like it was in Black Flag where you can swing onto their ship instead of waiting for this slow and awkward docking animation to get you close enough for you to hop on. Honestly, I hate this battle system as it feels clunky and awkward, but I can see why people would enjoy it as it has been vastly improved since ACIII.

Oh and I gotta say, the map looks cleaner as interest spots are spread further apart. Compared to Unity's mess of a map, this is pristine. The SIDEQUESTS are actually fun and engaging this time around, rivalling the likes of Witcher III where the stories actually kinda matter, and the rewards are mostly worth it to feed that greed for more loot you can either equip, sell, or break down for parts for crafting. There were some sidequests where I actually got invested in these side characters' stories which is very rare in AC games to do because before it was just talk to some static NPC who doesn't even look you in the eye, that you can even walk away from while they're talking, but no. This time around, there are cinematic camera angles to deliver actual looking dialogue between assassin and NPC. ABOUT TIME, UBISOFT! GAWD!

Anyways, very damn good game, highly recommend. Odyssey vastly improves on all previous titles and cleans up the feel of the controls. However, combat is awkward on controller as you have R1/RB and R2/RT for light attacks and heavy attacks respectively. It's a strain on my fingers, personally, so I remapped them to Y and B on my Steam controller, along with making X my assassinate button because wtf is Y the assassinate button this time around? That makes no sense. Mapping the controller controls is kind of weird as a button used for several functions might not be useable if you map your controls in a way that conflicts the game's several situational controls (ie combat vs stealth, navigation vs interaction etc).

I think the next game should address this control issue as well as remove naval battle (PLEASE), and maybe even clean up those kill animations so they look like they're actually part of the same interaction, then that would be a perfect Assassin's Creed Game.

A seemingly richworld infrastructured through bland mechanics, unfortunately

A bright ore
A very beautiful world to see and to hear! Many places to explore and stories, through past and present, full of richness for our mind to question and learn.

Sculpting yours
Many ways to express yourself:you can wear different clothes as weapons and skillsets to hud personalizations and great graphic options with many others. Built-in screenshot taker and editor (simple editor with filters). I enjoy alot screenshotting and testing to see what was around me in a different way.

A flat deep
What's unfortunately did not catch my volition to support this wonderful place is the gameplay, which is really important in a game too. The strenght and sweat going in your sword swiveling through an encounter doesn't feel good, a bit "colorless" as the impacts: the combat dept feels shallow and doesn't let much space in creativity. It leads myself to remember what i lived in this world except when swords were drawn.

The persons
The incredible colors of the sea is as the people: their presences fully enrich whats around them, good or bad. As I travel along the many roads, as villages discovered as people, unfortunately, most interactions that I had seemed unfriendly and unkindful, as I walk among them, foots and horse foots, people pushed themselves or felt pushed. I felt like I was here with my existence but my impact on their lives did not add goodness. Their behaviors are quite all "culturally" similar and the lack of interaction varieties encourage to me not actually interact with them much (^_^) .

A fire burning plastic
RPG often inspire and leads to rich worlds to walk into but struggle to decide how to keep us, instead of why: it guides to an atmosphere of well seen oblong levels and the time it asking you. A beautiful world, yet, full of quests that doesn't reach my hearted and mindful volitions.

Economy philosophy
The price to support seems very fair and honest at 20-25€. More means commitment in your loveness and supportness of what this project (this game) encourage, goodly or badly, in the industry.
There is a in game shop where real money can be spend:it even sell things to evolve faster your progression.


My choice
Thank you to give me and many others the chance to attempt this beautiful game for many days freely. The world enrich my mind but mechanics couldn't reach me: I decided to not support it.


Thank you for reading and please, have a pretty lovely day <3

It's fun and full of things to do. I'm amazed at the research they put into the historical facts. The exploration is super fun. The handling of the ships is a bit different than in AC BlackFlag and Rogue, I needed a bit to get into that, but it works fine.

After a while, it does get a bit repetitive and tedious (like many Ubisoft Sandbox Game).

Still, would buy again.

I've played 6 different installments of Assassins Creed, AC Odyssey is in a league of it's own .
You have in your mind an idea of what an Assassins Creed game is from the few you have played in the past, right? drop them
You have never experienced the AC world in this way. Vast, beautiful, detailed and completely immersive. Sea battles, cultist hunts, mythical characters, large scale land battles, and of course.. assassinations. Side quests weave organically into the main quests back into the secondary main quests. I have found very little about this game i don't like and around every turn is an ancient greek world that works well together.

So it's a good game. It brings together all of the best mechanics of the past few AC games. It tries to bring in some inspirations from games like Witcher 3 and Shadow of Mordor with mixed results. Mid-game starts to feel really grindy, I think because this game has microtransactions. They're trying to sell boosts. A few quests REQUIRE a certain amount of coin or upgrades to proceed, and you just have to grind it up. It's not all too bad because the game is gigantic, almost bloated. There are so many places and quests to discover, but they are mostly very thinly written, so there's plenty of exploring to do, just not a lot of good narrative payoff for it.

Visually the textures and models are fantastic. But the facial animations are SO BAD. The voice acting isnt terrible but the way the models eyes randomly move around and with very inappropriate gestures and expressions.. cant take any of the cutscenes seriously.

Overall I give it a B+. Solid game. Entertaining combat and exploration. Worth a purchase. But it's not a game-of-the-year type experience due to the above gripes.

There is nothing new here, just a difference circus.

Hmm...

A brilliant game. Large open world RPG. Plenty to do, gorgeous to look at and explore, and mostly fun to play. There are plenty of good positive reviews out there to read and get specifics.

But........

I find myself chasing the same exact numbers I did over 30 years ago.

---------------------------------------------------

With 35 years of games grinding I am tired of chasing larger numbers. I understand that the state of RPG gaming is advancement with adventure filler, but with 100 million dollar budgets I'd hope someone would start looking at how we can find other ways to induce dopamine fulled motivation other than carrot and stick methods.

I need new experiences, not the same ones I had 30 years ago.

I should of waited till it was on sale.

Buy it if you are young and beautiful, but if you are a greying jaded old curmudgeon wait till it is on sale.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey Review

The Assassin’s Creed franchise is a one of the greatest franchises in
gaming history, but has also been a…Less than mediocre franchise at
times, to put it nicely. I still remember when I first played the original
Assassin’s Creed game, it was an entirely new and unique genre at that
time. There was no other game like it, and since then it has inspired
most of Ubisoft games to be like it in design and gameplay. But then the
bad years of the AC franchise came when a new AC game was an annual
event and every new game just felt more and more like the previous
game, but with more bugs. I can’t stress how great of a choice it was to
take a break a few years back from making a new AC game. Last year,
they came out with Assassin’s Creed: Origins and that was a fresh new
installment. It had all the good mechanics from past AC games while
adding new ones. All in all, it rejuvenated and breathed new life into a
once dying series.

So now, what about this year’s title? Odyssey - Is it back to the
monotonous and dull games of years past or does it match up with what
Origins had to offer?

Is this still Assassin’s Creed?
One stark change to the franchise (since Origins), is the fact that the
game has moved to a much more of a focus on having RPG elements
than being Hack and Slash-like, like in the original. This game also has a
huge importance on collecting unique and fancy loot. While it may not
be like the loot collecting in games such as Destiny and Warframe, it
does hold its own. In the end it is not in the same genre as these other
games and is not designed to be a looter game. Therefore, for a game to
not be a “looter”, yet have the astonishing variety of loot found in this
game is a huge positive.

Combat and Gameplay Mechanics
Something that is common to RPGs, but not to most previous AC games
is the level system with skill points to put into various abilities. At the
start you will not have many abilities or skills and the game may feel like
a hack and slash game, but as you progress through the game, the
combat will also get better. I can say with certainty that this game has
one of the best combat mechanics you will see in any game. You have a
wide variety of blocks, attacks, assassinations, etc. at your disposal.

There is a bounty system, if you harm innocent lives and commit crimes
then there will be a bounty on your head. And at times when you least
expect it, you will be notified that 1 or more bounty hunters are after
you. Now these aren’t the same as the tiny, trash mobs you fight most of
the game. No, these bounty hunters are more like boss fights. And when
you see them you better run as fast as you can unless you want to risk
your life.

There are many more unique gameplay elements that I will touch on in
other parts of this review.

Story
I will try and give a brief summary of some parts of the story without
spoiling anything. You have a very basic character creation system with
the main choice being whether you choose male or female character.
Throughout the story you are trying to reconnect with your past while
also trying to change the future of Ancient Greece for the better.

You face a cult throughout the story and you are given this flowchart
with various members of the cult but with their identities hidden. You
can perform missions and other quests to uncover more information

about these members and once you have identified them you can take
them out. One by one, you try and take down the entire cult. But keep in
mind that most of these members aren’t easy to kill, they are extremely
challenging and there is a hefty reward for killing them with exquisite
loot drops.

You also have Greece split up into various regions and in each of them
you can influence a particular faction such as the Spartans and Athens.
Once you have earned enough influence you can wage war on the other
faction in the area. These triggers a war-type mission which is a huge
scale battle. Once you have defeated enough of the enemy you have to
fight a final boss to finally defeat the faction and gain control for your
allies. This is a unique game mode not seen in other games and is a
wonderful addition to this game.

Naval Combat
Now earlier in this review I said that they added new elements but kept
good ones from previous games, and one good decision was to bring
back the naval combat from Black Flag. There are a few changes such as
no cannons, since there weren’t any cannons during the period the
game is set in. But they have replaced them with things such as a javelin
barrage. All in all, there are small changes to the naval combat, but it is
just as good as in Black Flag. One thing that adds to the experience, is
the gorgeous water textures and graphics. Sailing through this huge
open world looks, as beautiful as you can imagine.

Graphics and Performance
This game has some of the best graphic design and artwork you will see
in any game. Yes, some of the assets are reused from Origins, but that
just tells you how beautiful Origins looked and this one is even better. To
add to the amazing graphical quality, the game runs, as smooth as
butter. And this isn’t just for me, but for most people on the internet.

This just shows how much has changed since the days of AC: Unity
where the game was a bug infested mess on release.

Go and get the game ASAP!
What are you waiting for? This game is a masterpiece. While there are a
couple of issues when it comes to the leveling system being a bit too
much of a grind towards the end game, a couple of side quests will help
you on your way. Don’t buy the microtransaction currency to boost your
character, don’t support this corporate greed. Just play some side quests
which won’t be an annoying thing to do, as this game is truly enjoyable.
It’s a game you will come back to time after time and enjoy over the
period of months rather than rushing through the game in a weekend.
This game is definitely worth the money for old fans and new ones too!

Rate: 10/10

Can't spell assassin without twice the ass and a little bit of sin
Standard fare open-world hacky slashy "RPG" from UBISOFT, hot off the heels of AC: ORIGINS; Odyssey seeks to further expand on the Isu side of things by introducing you to an even older ancestor but also giving you the choice to choose whether or not it will be a man or a woman (though canonically its supposed to just be the woman Kassandra)

By now you will have already read a ton of reviews or even videos about this game so let's keep it kind of brief.

Combat is more or less the same from Origins except you can't block anymore, only parry and dodge. The skills / perks / abilities or whatever you wanna call them will help you traverse, murder, scout and track as you explore the greek isles. Voice acting and sound design is pretty good, can be quite immersive sometimes and it really gives you that greek feel.

Graphics are pretty great, optimization can use a bit of work as you will notice a lot of frame drops in certain areas (most especially in DLC areas) but they don't stick around or happen to often that it becomes an issue. Well at least not for me during my 100+ hour run.

The side missions aren't as optional as I'd like because you kind of need them to grind EXP just so you can survive the next story mission. The level / exp scaling is off a bit so it can get pretty tedious. If this game didn't hook you with first few minutes, you're likely not gonna have a good time.

They have transmog in this game so long as you've picked up that armor/weapon before so that's always a plus in my book. The story has a lot of good moments but they aren't as memorable as past AC releases, you might finish the game and find that the DLC story stuck to you more than the main story.

All in all, I would rate this game a solid 3/5 cause it does have a lot of moments where its dull and it also has a lot of moments where you really enjoy what you're doing. Does this make me hopeful for the next few AC games? If they stick to the assassin motif, sure. But i'm not holding my breath.

Catch this on a sale

People will continue to bash the series I guess, no matter what is made of it. I like the fact I play every game way after its initial hype, AC series always keep me hooked.

It has lore, it has gameplay, it makes me happy and having a lot of fun. That I won't argument with anything else but with the facts I've finished every single one - besides Origins, which I'll do soon - to the end of main quest line. Nowadays barely 10% of the games I'll finish because they're so empty.

AC games are the ones I'll buy with no regrets, no doubts. With Odyssey they added choices, old-Bioware kinda way, AND I LOVED IT. Thank you Ubisoft for never giving up on such a amazing series - I'm excited already for the next installment.

Decent game, but shockingly buggy, given both it's triple A status, and the fact that it uses basically the exact same game engine as Assassin's Creed Origins, which seemed to have none of these bugs. I've had UI elements disappear randomly (including my health bar, and tags above enemies - those are pretty rare. Much more common is the popup information about inventory disappearing). Another common bug is the eagle breaking so it can't be using to find tablets. The game is also a bit too repetitive, and features microtransactions. The item UI also makes selling large quantities of junk items (Which inevitably build up in your inventory) and buying large amounts of wood, to upgrade your ship, needlessly aggravating.

The map is also pretty bad - quests will often tell you what region they're in, but the map desperately needs a search function, given the large number of regions and the unimportance of the region and subregion names mean you won't be learning most of them.

Otherwise, it's a decent game, certainly more colorful than its predecessor. The writing for the main questions and "yellow exclamation mark" is consistently good, the voice acting is fine. The gameplay is just like the previous one, albeit with a more interesting skill tree, and a smattering of tiny new gameplay elements.

I would not recommend paying full price for the game, but think it's good enough to be worth picking up on sale. I wish there were a more neatral option, but I'm marking this as not recommended.

Odyssey is not your typical Assassin's Creed title and will disappoint long-time fans who expect it to fit into the same criteria they came to expect from these titles.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey fits more into the world of Witcher or Skyrim than anything. The world is beautiful and vibrant. Size wise, it is definitely larger than any of the titles that came before it. The world does not feel empty. There is always something to do as you are traveling between towns and cities on your quests.

Similar to Assassin's Creed Syndicate, this game offers a male and female protagonist to play as, however the choice whether to be one or the other is made at the beginning of a new game. There is no option to switch back and fourth. Personally, the female protagonist Kassandra appealed to me the most. Her voice acting was done extremely well, unlike Alexios, who sounds goofy and off time to time.

The story line captivated me to keep playing for hundreds of hours. Your role is not one of an assassin, but rather of a mercenary who sets out to help others with their problems. You will be saving villagers, raiding forts, taking down wild animals, pillaging tombs, and more as you set out to explore ancient Greece.

There are many fun perks to play with that will enhance your character and provide you with different options to handle your enemies. You may choose to specialize in close range brutal combat setting your weapons ablaze, kicking people off ledges with the infamous spartan kick, or ripping enemy shields out of their hands and smashing them with it. Perhaps a more stealthy approach is what you will go with, utilizing poisoned weapons and smoke bombs, assassin daggers, and more. Finally, the bow is another option for those scared to fight toe to toe with the ancient legends of Greece.

As you play you will discover new weapons and armor and gather supplies to upgrade your trireme, Adrestia. Unfortunately, the new equipment quickly becomes meaningless after you gain a few levels and outgrow it, requiring a lot of materials to upgrade it to fit your level. This may come off as a bit grindy and put some people off. It's definitely not a system that is quick to navigate. Prepare to spend hours gathering supplies and money from exploration, quests, and looting enemies to get what you need.

As far as the actual game play elements. No gripes. The game is fluid. Combat is great. It's easy to learn and understand. Climbing has been made easier and less frustrating. However, it feels a little stupid sometimes. For example, falling from heights will no longer kill your character. No longer how high up. Will always leave your character on a sliver of health left. For some it may be great as it will save the frustrating of wasting time to climb down, but for others it may ruin the immersion.

Speaking of immersion, the game handles it beautifully. The graphics are amazing. The character progression is done well. I spent a long time just listening to conversations between characters and was given choices by the game, that actually mattered in what happened in the world around me. These were some of my most exciting parts of the game. I looked forward to those cutscenes.

At a quick glance:

Combat: 10/10
Graphics: 10/10
Immersion: 8/10
Quests: 8/10
Story line: 10/10
Characters: 10/10
Character Development: 9/10
DLC content: 6/10
Grind Level: 5/10

Hope this review helps! This game is definitely a must play!

I bought this game 14 days ago. With todays update all sound got ruined and Ubisoft descriptions on how to fix it are vague and hard to understand at best. I contacted their support agent and he just gave me a link to the troubleshooter so not much help there. Such an old game with such big bugs i would not recommend it for its price.

Honestly the game isn't worth the time if you're someone like me who grew up with the Ezio trilogy. The story for this game is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and is nothing amazing like Ezio's story. Other than that the gameplay is alright nothing stands out about it.

Edit. To be clear. I really dislike the way Ubisoft has been releasing games far before they are ready. If this game launched as it is now, I would have originally recommended it. My original experience with this game can be found below but it essentially was full of bugs, had a bad script and facial animations, and a lack of content other than chores that are an exact copy of a looter/shooter like Ubisoft's The Division. The ONLY thing that could be praised was the exceptional graphics and environment that was MASSIVE.
Currently, most of these issues have been fixed. There are no more glaring bugs or performance issues. The issues with the script and facial animations can be avoided by playing as Kassandra instead of Alexios (I seriously do not understand how two main characters can be so different in animation quality). And Ubisoft rebalanced the loot and combat system while including new content that makes the game less of a grind and more enjoyable to play. I STRONGLY recommend you purchase the game including all its DLC only when on sale as even with all of these fixes the game just doesn't justify such a high cost.
Overall, if you can get the full game (the DLC here should have been included in the base game) for $60 or less then it is worth it.


A Franchise Gone Wrong:
To be very clear for anyone who loves the assassins creed franchise and playstyle, this is not that kind of game By Far. This is Warriors Creed designed to be a single player MMORPG in a world of precurser artifcats. I do like some of the game and it does some things very well, but unfortunately, it does more than fall short in many important aspects.
Pros: Graphics (10/10) in all aspects. Nuff said.
Audio (8/10)
Less out of Animus time.
Has a ton of content.
Huge world.
Cons: ITS SUCH A GRIND. All games have progression, but not all make it feel like so much work.
Item system is chance based and MMORPG style.
Combat system is lengthy and unbalanced to support the MMORPG chance based item system.
Story has a good concept but extremely poor script and delivery. It is unmotivating and unbelievable.
Repetative as a spinning wheel.
Oeverall: This is an amazing looking and sounding game about grinding for the next item/weapon/armor to grind to the next level through repetative side quests so you can see the poorly written cutscene (that is well acted and looks amazing) so that you can grind for more money and resources to upgrade your gear to grind to the next level and get better gear so you can get to the next cutscene. Repeat this for 25-50 hours depending on how much you want to explore and complete. And my biggest gripe is that it is almost impossible to play as an assassin until mid-late game. I would not have minded the grind if the combat was more balanced or if the story was half decenent but overall this game felt like work for unapealing rewards. I hoenstly was more drawn to a novel I was currently reading then playing this and I am a long time game lover, especially of rpg's and the assassins creed franchise. In hidnsight, I would most certainly purchase the game again, but only on sale because even if the amount of content is equivalent to the purchase price, most of this games content felt like repetative work. I probably won't come back to it for a second play through for a very long time.

~80 hours into this game and just finished it (haven't finished the DLC yet). This is the best game I've played in a while. The story is fantastic, controls are excellent and intuitive, and the world, while gigantic, was relatively easy to navigate and not too tedious as many other open-world type games tend to be. The amount of content in this game is absolutely bonkers. Nearly every action you take in this game feels challenging and satisfying to complete - from simply finding somone who's lost in the woods, to single-handedly wiping out an entire fortress full of Athenian soldiers. This game makes you feel like a demigod to be feared and respected, I'll be taking a break before I return to clear up the DLC. Highly, highly, highly recommend this game.

Well I am extremely happy with this game, at first I was unsure due to the assassins creed franchise in my opinion not my sort of game at all. I am a far cry and skyrim kinda gamer ya know.
So I for the first time downloaded this game illegally....
I fell in love and wanted to participate in the growth of the game so I went out and purchased the top copy and have never looked back, I have so far have had nothing but fun I did however need to start the game from scratch as the cracked game (save) I can only assume was different then the legit steam copy as it never worked.
So now after starting from scratch from LV31 I am now LV42 on my new save and am STILL NOT BORED!!.
I can highly recommend this game and yes IT IS NOT ASSASSINS CREED! So if you LOVE FAR CRY then you should BUY THIS!!! and you get to still be sneeky beeky like as also in farcry

I like when steam does the freeweek, otherwise I don't think I would have ever tried this game, for what I saw today,I have to say that it's a masterpiece, a beautiful experience that every gamer should try.This is not the right moment to buy a new game, but maybe in the future I will do it, I hope.

This game's world is so mesmerising that, even if it had just the gameplay of an average walking simulator, it would still be a 10/10.

Add in an engaging action RPG gameplay with stealth elements on top of that, and you've got one of my favourite games ever.

I remind myself how much more fun I had playing this game in retrospect when I played valhalla - I didn't play too much despite my 50 hour playtime since the game is simply massive, maybe too massive for it's own good but still a very refined, very impressive game

I started playing this right after finishing Origins. I really liked Origins, but I felt it was more of a foundation and it could have improved on many things. I was looking forward to what improvements were in store for me in Odyssey, but from start to finish this game felt like leaps and bounds backwards from its predecessor. The disappointment and boredom I endured parallels that which I felt while playing Far Cry 5. There is so much wrong with this game, and that's excluding my personal distaste for mythical creatures, superpowers, dialogue choices, and lack of a hidden blade in an Assassin's Creed game. I could have withheld those complaints if it weren't for:

So my review turned out pretty long, and Steam wouldn't let me post it. So I posted it here[docs.google.com] on Google Docs.

However my main complaints would be:

- Lazy world design
- Bad quest design, especially outside the main story
- Bad combat/gameplay
- Pointless mechanics such as the battles and mercenaries
- Endless roadblocks and time wasters that are intentional to try and influence you to spend real money.
- Bad gear system

ive played 2 hours and refunded it.... please read this before you buy!

theres microtransactions?! to boost your progression hmmm but why would u need that? because the quests under pay u with exp and gold which always makes you weaker than your enemy. the combat system is awful and lazy going with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gear score system where if u try to fight someone who is 2 levels higher than u then be prepared to hit them 100 times atleast, that is not an over exaggeration. u can have a good looking sword nice dmg then u can go to the blacksmith and get a wooden sword that does double ur dmg? yup that makes sense? its just lazy.. but if u like all that ♥♥♥♥ then the game is great. graphics are really nice, from the quests i did, they did have a nice story to them... but honestly overall i give the game a 3/10. dont give ubisoft ur money for this lazy game...

The good:

- Content is plentiful and the map is huge, lots to explore.
- The stories are well thought out. The plot is interesting enough to keep you playing.
- The RPG elements are more dominant here than they were in Origins

The bad:

- Runs OK but considerably worse FPS than Origins.
- There is no 'definite' end to the main story arc. This makes the game feel grindy at times.
- Upgrading weapons is way too expensive.
- KEY PLOT POINT ARE ONLY EXPLAINED IN THE DLC. As such, the game is only worth its salt as an Assassin's Creed game if you get the season pass.

All in all, I recommend getting this game, it is sure to captivate you and keep you playing for a good while. The graphics and gameplay mechanics are good. The controversial microtransactions are kept in the background enough for you to not notice them as a gameplay feature during normal play. The season pass is a must, and for what you get, I think it's double worth it.

Assassins Creed Odyssey has to be one of the best yet from the game time that I have. There is so much to do and it can be very challenging for the player when it wants to be. You can explore the world at whatever pace you like and when you look at the size of the map it truly is amazing. The graphics are incredible and I cannot wait to continue playing and exploring more of this game.

In short, this is a great game and it's worth the money.

Pros
- Main story is not up to the quality of stories in games like Witcher 3, but it's great. There are many side quests that have interesting stories, but feels like the player is doing the same thing in such quests.
-Gameplay - I like the whole leveling systems and different abilities. (Tip: Don't upgrade your armor and weapons each time you level up, upgrade once every 10 levels). You can play and experiment with lot of builds.
-Graphics - It's more like origins, I wish the engine supported SLI.

Cons
-Game takes lot of influence from Shadow of War, Witcher 3 and Mass Effect. But they are not executed well. More precisely, game does not offer innovative features. But this does not make the game bad. It feels you have experienced the same thing before
-Large area, but less details. City of Athens and Sparta are different, but other locations feels the same. They seems to have the same design.

It's probably the best Assassin's Creed because it's so unlike an Assassin's Creed game. Much of the gameplay is still there - the stealth, assassinations, and combat (though the combat is different from older AC games). But because it takes place before the canonical founding of the Assassins and Templars, they aren't present in the game. Furthermore, the modern branch of the story is reduced to 4 very short sequences, and one of them is entirely skippable.

About 5% of this game is rooted in Assassin's Creed - talking about Abstergo, the animus, the first civilization, the modern story, etc. These are easily the worst parts. The dialogue is terrible, the characters are poorly written, and ultimately it's just not interesting.

The remaining 95% is absolutely amazing. The dialogue is usually pretty solid, the characters are interesting and memorable (they did such a good job here it frequently felt like playing a BioWare game), and every location is beautiful. The story is pretty great, and it really does feel like playing through an epic about a Greek hero. It has enough twists and turns to keep things fresh, but it still isn't too self-serious or self-important (other than the Assassin's Creed tie-in garbage).

I'm not really absolutely sure why the "grindy" criticism is so prevalent. I was consistently 5+ levels ahead of the curve by doing all of the secondary quests, and the micro-transaction boosts were entirely unneeded. So I never had to grind - I just had to keep playing more of the game with fresh, hand-crafted content, and it kept me ahead of the XP curve.

That said, are 2 kinds of side quests. There are loads of simple, "infinite" quests such as "kill 5 wolves" or "kill that nameless commander over there," and these can and should be ignored. Then there are secondary quests which are extra hand-crafted content outside of the main story. In Skyrim terms, these are radiant quests (which are bad and should be ignored) and non-main quests (which are great and you should do them). Just like in Skyrim, if you ignore the non-main quests, you are missing out - you'll both fall behind in XP/gear and you'll skip some really great story/characters/content. Just like in Skyrim, you shouldn't play the radiant quests because they are horrible and grindy and you aren't really missing out on XP/gear or content.

Another criticism I've seen for this game is that it isn't enough like the other Assassin's Creed games. Gameplay-wise, it's definitely a solid improvement and iteration on the AC formula (which is another thing that makes it unlike an AC game, because the franchise is notorious for not innovating or improving). But story-wise, it is absolutely a far cry from other AC games. This, to me, is only a positive thing - I didn't actually know that anybody liked the AC story/canon, because I (and most people I know) think it's kind of garbage. But it's true that if you want a game heavy on the AC canon, this game might disappoint you. Perhaps if they just kept the same exact gameplay, but removed all references of Assassin's Creed and its canon/story, I would like this game more and so would AC fans.

Ultimately, like almost every game on the planet, you will run out of things to do. But it took me 90 hours to get to that point, so... It's got some good longevity. Its replayability is somewhat lacking, and I think that's mainly because it doesn't have mod support. Ubisoft are releasing new content, such as some small side quests and a boss fight, but they're sort of underwhelming. There are other open world games that I can keep coming back to because I can completely change the experience (Elder Scrolls), but it's impossible for this one.

Absolutely stunning game ,totally loved it.The fact that it allows your to build your character to your gamestyle itself is an achievement. You can play as assassin ,warrior or hunter builds and all three are fun as well. This is never seen before in an ac game .The ancient world of Greece and the detail to things is incredible. Even side quests feel like fun.Totally recommend it if you want a fresh and different experience of an ac game

10/10 I cannot recommend this game enough. It is in my opinion one of the best open world rpg ever made.

Pros:
-Massive open world, ~130km² with a LOT to do, and see, and experience.
-Deep character ability tree and equipment selection, allows you to customize your character to fit your play style from super stealth assassin that would make Solid Snake proud, to a hard charging head first rage filled mercenary warrior that would make Leonidas proud, the style of play is completely up to you.
-It has an amazing story
-Equipment appearance changer, find a new sword that has great stats but hate the way it looks no problem you can make it look like any other sword you've found, don't like your helmet change the way it looks, want new shoes not a problem, you get to choose exactly how your character equipment and gear looks.

Cons:
-Massive open world, I mean the map is ~130km² you can miss stuff easily, it can take time to get where you need to go (though the journey is always beautiful)
-The sailing can be kind of boring, gorgeous but boring, honestly the naval battles are really fun but I just wish the out of combat sailing speed was turned up a little bit.

oh I almost forgot the best part of the whole game, THERE'S A FRICKIN UNICORN IN THE GAME. A unicorn that you get to ride around ancient Greece on, its hilarious and awesome.

After a good deal of time as an Assassin's Creed veteran, I've taken the time to detail a short review summary of this game.

Combat is great
Graphics are amazing but you need a strong PC
Story is average with some good plot twists depending on the choices you make
Open world is astonishing
Sea combat returns from Black Flag!

But there are downsides...

Certain skills have no use
Frustrating bounty hunters
Leveled enemies blocking you advancing unless you level up
The grind is real

All in all, this is an excellent game in terms of content and gameplay
This is NOT an Assassin's Creed game though. A good game but drifts too far apart from it's original identity.
8/10

Even though Odyssey breaks some rules which made the AC series one of the most well known game series in the world, like the absence of the Hidden Blade or the fact that you can choose your protagonist (This is different than Syndicate, where you can switch between the Frye twins, Jacob and Evie, at any time in the game. In Odyssey this choice is 90% just for customisation and appearance, and you can't change between Alexios and Kassandra during your playthrough, unlike in Syndicate.), it's still a VERY good game. I finished the main story and i think they did a good job with it, although it could've been better. You can spend 100+ hours in this game and not get bored, thanks to the open world activities and the awesome side quests. The representation of Greece is just amazing. Ubisoft sure knows how to make a good open world. I would rate this game a solid 9/10

Just finished the main storyline and I can say that this is not only my favorite AC game but one of the best games that I've ever played. The open world experience is so immersive, this is one of the few times that I feel this much immersed while playing. I'm a big fan of Ancient Greek and seeing Sokrates, Sophokles, Pythagoras, Plato, Hippokrates, Herodotos, Democritus, Aristophanes and many others was amazing. The RPG aspect of this game is absolutely amazing. You literally can play these historical personages' questlines, talk with them and have an individual journey with them.

The cities and platos are amazing too. In some cases, you climb somewhere high and look really far (I mean kilometers far) and then start riding there without any loading screen or interruption. It has a HUGE map including Makedonia, Athens, Mykonos, Kephallonia etc. and you can travel through these places without any loading screens. And I have to mention the citizens' idle animations. I'd like to give it an example. After finishing a quest in Arkadia, I was walking throught the streets of Ancient Greek and I saw a man, teaching two kids how to fight. I stopped and started watching to see how much they invested on animating them. They listened their teacher and then started fighting and It kept going. There are musicians on the streets, salesmen, bounty hunters, sometimes region leaders, normal citizens, drunk people, fishermen etc. The game is full of immersive elements that keeps you in the game for a really long time.

I'm a big fan of this combat system too. Shadow of War is one of my favorite games of all time and Odyssey's combat style is really similar to that but much realistic with less brutalism. In the other hand, the ship fights are amazing. I loved Black Flag and It was really groundbreaking at It's time but this game took sea traveling and sea combat to another level for me. The system is pretty similar but with more features. You can upgrade your ship and get stronger and fight other ships. You can either destroy them from far or you can anchor their ship and have a death battle. And the gaming experience amazing.

I haven't completed or started the DLC content properly yet so I'm not capable of reviewing those but from only the base game's experience, It was AMAZING. I started the game and started doing a side quest storyline and lost myself into it, thinking It was some part of the main storyline because they were too good to be side quests. After completing some few quests back to back, I've said farewell by having an affair with my quest giver and the questline was over. At that moment, I've realized that It was just a sidequest and I knew this game is going to be amazing.

Overall, just discovering new places and walking in the cities is so much fun by itself. And the maps are beautiful. Beautiful environment design! I'm probably going to be completing all of the achievements after completing the DLC contents.

I loved Origins too by the way. It was a great game too and really fun but this is on another level. Even If you're not a fan of AC series you should definitely try it. It's just beautiful to be able play a game set in Ancient Greek era.

It's a great game, one of the best in the entire franchise. It has a great story, a great protagonist (regardless of which one you choose), and a great environment and world. AC Odyssey has wonderful RPG elements to it, making for satisfying fights in boss battles and conquest (war) battles. Although the series has leaned heavily towards the RPG genre, it still expects the stealth and strategy from the previous games in the franchise through its mercenary system that is more forgiving to the silent-assassin type players that loved the previous entries to the franchise. It uses skill trees, making the player have personalized experiences in the game, while still allowing an easy shift in play style but allowing it to be reset for a seldom, almost negligible drachmae. Additionally, there are numerous unique and often hilarious side quests that allows the players to enjoy even a quick session of the game. Admittedly, one of the major criticisms towards the series is its plethora of side-quests, which can be overwhelming but it could also be satisfying, depending on how the player takes them on. For instance, when I could only dedicate minutes of my time towards playing the game, I just do a chain of side quests that often leaves me satisfied and entertained once finished. The naval battles are entertaining, and it is very satisfying to either board an enemy ship or just cleave it in half. It's also very user-friendly, it allows for older fans (especially AC Origins players) to jump right into action and for new players to learn the game mechanics (of both keyboard and controller) easily.
That being said, I'm aware that, like many games, Odyssey is not everyone's cup of tea but I can truly say that I love this game.

Pros:
- Graphically, it is the most stunning Assassins Creed game to date.
- Gameplay is addictive for approximately 30 hours.
- Everything Greek Mythology from epic legendary heroes and their weapons to Gods to battles to ships to poets to beasts and monsters are within the game (Think 300, Achilles, Odyssey, Cyclops, Theseus, Socrates, etc.).
- Extreme detail in all aspects of the game from visual to combat to communications.
Cons:
- For all it’s marketing, there isn’t any long term outcome to any decisions made whether stealing or interactive decisions.
- NPC’s (Think Fable) DO NOT react to character progression and always react the same to you regardless of your level or decisions.
- Bug when you tell Phoibe whether you’ll come back to Kephalonia or not... she later appears in Athens saying you said you weren’t coming back even though you choose the decision that told her you were.
- Cult side story seems completely out of nowhere and tiresome, I would rather they fleshed out more of the Athens verse Spartans and mercenary parts.
- Synchronization points start to become dull buildings etc. after awhile when first they were epic statues of Gods
- Gameplay gets repetitive (Think combat, missions, general things to do, etc.) after approximately 30 hours or after level 20
- Random “fetch me this” side quests that bare no reason
- Annoying weekly emails from Ubisoft to buy a statue or merchandise or content including ingame microtransactions to assist you
- After a certain point your character can leap off any depth and take no fall damage, can purchase a unicorn skin for your horse, and general unrealistic things that take away from building “Your legend.”
In conclusion, this is THE most visually stunning game I have ever played, however, you never truly feel addicted or immersed into this world. There are subtle things that detract you from fully enjoying this game such as non reaction from NPC’s (Should have some different reaction towards your decisions and progression), random cult quest that has nothing to do with Greek mythology, general feeling of a mercenary outcast that is constantly being attacked by both Spartans and Athenians, Unicorn horse skin and zero fall damage taking away from realism, no long term reward for choosing benevolent decisions/not stealing vice versa, constant emails offers to purchase merchandise by Ubisoft and more.

"Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle....."

At least that's how I think someone else described this game, and it's quite apt. The game is gorgeous graphically, there is some good voice acting in places, a lot of work has obviously gone into it, and for that, the developers deserve credit. However, there are a number of reasons why I can't recommend this game, unless you can get it on sale like I did.

- The levelling system. You never really feel a sense of progression in this game as everything more or less scales with your character's level. Most enemies can generally kill you in just a few hits, unless they are several levels below you. Archers and warriors with poisoned or flaming weapons are always a big threat, regardless of your level. You are constantly forced to upgrade or buy new gear as the level 7 sword you have now at level 7 is markedly inferior to the level 8 spear you can buy from a merchant when you reach level 8. For some inane reason, the game does not allow you to get rid of legendary items or sell them. Instead, you have to lug all this junk around with you or else store it in your personal chest on your ship. I guess this was done because, heavens forbid, some people might get upset if they can't complete their legendary armour sets because they accidentally sold a piece of it.
- Brain-dead AI. With enough time and patience, you can assassinate most of the soldiers in any fort by simply hiding in the same bush, whistling until someone comes over to investigate, then assassinating them. Rinse and repeat. Lone Athenian soldiers will recklessly charge into outposts of Spartan soldiers that outnumber them 5 or more to 1. Any time someone attacks you in a village, the locals all seem to whip out brooms from nowhere and fearlessly take you on as well, with no regard for their own safety. Villagers and, occasionally,their pet dogs, will stray too close to a flaming brazier, catch on fire, then proceed to burn to death while everyone else just ignores them and carries on as usual even when their charred corpses are lying on the ground.
- In-game microtransactions. This is already annoying in itself, but does Ubisoft really have to insist on advertising their other games in this one? I noticed that when I tried playing this game again after a long break, I suddenly had complete sets of Viking armour and Renaissance era armour in my inventory, and some of the characters from other Assassin's Creed games are now available as lieutenants on my ship. Even if you don't assign them to your available lieutenant slots, you can't dismiss any of them, and you can't drop or sell any of the armour either. I don't like having all this forced on me without earning it - I'd prefer to recruit lieutenants and find/buy armour myself over the course of the game.
- Repetitiveness. The game is great fun to begin with, but rapidly becomes extremely repetitive. There is little variation in the general gameplay. You sail across the sea, arrive in a region suitable for your level, take on quests from notice boards or NPCs which generally involve you giving them money, sinking X number of ships, delivering a message, or killing some bandit/soldier/politician, just so you can accumulate enough XP to be of sufficient level to follow the main story, which seems a bit tepid in itself. Occasionally you will have to infiltrate a fort to rescue someone or retrieve something, which usually involves you bumping off most or all of the resident soldiers by hiding in the bushes and assassinating them. There are also conquest battles, most of which are thankfully optional and involve you fighting for a specific side and killing as many enemy soldiers as quickly as possible so your chosen side can win the battle. Rinse and repeat.
- The writing. Very basic and seems to be aimed at 16 year old console junkies with raging hormones and limited attention spans. Example is the cringy dialog when you try to recruit Odessa in Megara, with every second dialog option being an "I want to shag you" option.
- Other stuff. Why can't I use a shield when the classic Greek warriors of this era generally used shields?
- Having to have UPlay installed in order to run this game. 'Nuff said.

I don't have Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but it sounds like Ubisoft have already attempted to address some of these issues (like levelled items and repetitive quests) in that game, so good for them.

If you can get past the terriable lip sync, and the fact that they only have 4-5 different faces on all the interactive NPCs. It's a pretty good game. But, srsly, everyone looks the bloody same except for a few different people.

One of the best RPGs ever made. If you like history / ancient Greece / mythology, then you cant miss this one. Highly recommend.

- enormous map with fantastic exploration and things to do.
- complex and vast combat / gameplay mechanics
- amazing storytelling
- impressive graphics
- very immersive

No words can really describe what a revelation this game is. You have to try it for yourself and get blown away by its complexity. I have played a lot of RPGs, but this is easily the best one in my opinion. No matter the price/discount you should get it, it's a MUST HAVE.

This game had so much potential to be one of the best games in terms of the atmosphere, fighting dynamics and advanced rpg elements, unfortunately it failed due to a ridiculous game system and decisions to be made.

When I first started the game, I was amazed by its world, the atmosphere was great, the map was huge, I was free to travel on land and in the sea, the assassin elements were nice even though they were much less than other ac titles.

After a 25 hours of gameplay, i noticed that i'm just doing the same missions over and over again and i had to do hourless side missions. The atmosphere is great but the graphics seemed less detailed than origins, horse riding is unrealistic, the number of in-game animations is low. The parkour sucks, basically the worst assassin's creed parkour game of all time.

Odyssey missions are always the same and take hours, after a while gets boring. While you are 35 levels, you can be asked to be 40 levels for the new mission and again, you have do side missions for hours. also there are 42 cultics that has to be killed. my gosh...

Lastly, there is a video of comparison between odyssey and origins...fyi

An amazing alternate spin on the AC series, this game plays more like a classic RPG while maintaining most of the standard AC elements. In terms of meta story, it's one of the best, if not the best since AC Brotherhood. Kassandra is also an amazing character and is the number one favorite now of the series in total thanks to her wide range of character dynamics, aided by the multi-choice story mode, but her story in general is an absolute experience recommended for all players new or veteran.

Very fun and immersive game. You'll definitely be spending some time playing this game. I love it. Though I wish you could have, Sword and Shield, Pet animals, Chase scenes, Ambushes and a lot more blood. Origins actually has all of that. It's like they cheaped out on the animations in this game as their is very few. Theirs no assassins blade either. I still haven't beaten it yet. I'm 80+ hours in only half way through the story. Their is so much to do, like twice as much as their is in origins. I'm not a fan of the voice acting either though it is nice to hear a woman's voice for once. It's awesome to be a female too as I love looking at female backs instead of male ones. The Season Pass is 50$ CDN and It might not be worth it if its gong to be anything like Origins or other Season Passes and DLC's. They were always short and barley anything new. I give it a 8.5/10!

Don't get the Time Savers. Don't worry about the level-gate, it rears it's ugly head once and not for very long. This is a game where you should be going out and diving into all that it has to offer. Blitzing the story on an open world game is quite ridiculous, in my humble opinion.

Explore. The world is beautiful. I enjoyed roaming/sailing around. Even raiding them tombs for extra ability points.

Kill. There's lots of Cultists out there. Sometimes the only way to find them is by going through alot of people.

Loot. Once you're done with the above, you get the goods. Collecting the armor sets or just engraving what you find is enjoyable to boost your primary playstyle or try out specific "builds".

I hated Origins, but I loved the heck out of Odyssey. I am going to blame it on the setting. My rig isn't the most powerful, but I was running on max settings for most of it. I only turned things off/down when it came time for conquest battles, when lots of things were going on at once graphics-wise.

I am a fan of Assassin's Creed franchise and I have played its every single game (except Origins). This however, is really an extraordinary game. There are so many instances that keeps the player glued to the game. I'm really happy to have the Sea Adventures back. The last time I had so much fun was back when Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag came out.

Yes! I admit that the game is different compared to its predecessors and there are so many so called fans whining about it. For an RPG Lover and an AC Fan like me, It's something I'd definitely recommend you buying.

Whenever an RPG game is out, people usually compare it with CDPR's The Witcher 3 The Wild Hunt. I love The Witcher and my heart felt really heavy after completing the game. I find this game an alternative in that case. I have like 68 hours in this game and have made it to Episode 6.

I am aware about "Legacy of the First Blade" and will definitely give it a go once I'm done with the main Quests.

If you really want to Enjoy this game, just DON'T rush it.

UPDATE: I finally completed the main campaign after 102 hours. LOVED IT!

if this isn't Assassin's Creed, I don't know what is!

[+] Beautiful Landmark With Historical Knowledge Everywhere U look at this Game. It's like fantasy of modern day Assassin's Creed players.

[+] The RPG approach only make the game lengthy & gave a reward for exploration. Nothing wrong with that unless u get distracted from the main storyline!

[+] Various Armor with Real Time Rendered Cut Scenes were eyegasm.

[+] Auto Save were frequent with a very convenient manual save feature. Kudos to That!

[+] Details level across the landmarks were mindblowing & fun to explore.

[+] Photomode Exists (only complain Frames & Presets could've done with little bit more variety)

[+] Yes, one hit stealth Assassination is possible! (Need a little brain in between ur eyes to craft & approach to ur preferred playstyle xD)


[-] Most useless ride & weird Horse physicality I've ever seen!

[-] Same location used for multiple side quests, made the experience a bit generic.

I recommend this game only & only for Non Biased Assassin's Creed Players & RPG lovers, Peace! :)

What a game! :D
No shortage of things to do, interesting characters to meet who you start to care about, legendary animals to hunt down, tombs to raid, sharks to kill, ships to sink and what not. A beautiful story interwoven into an even more gorgeous Ancient Greek landscape.

Yes, there is grind but only for people who like it. I enjoyed strolling through the landscape taking in the views, so it wasn't much of a grind to me, only more fun. People seem to be complaining about the in-game purchases but this is again only for those who want that. During my entire playthrough, never once did I feel the need to get anything from the in-game store.
Absolute masterpiece of a game, and with the two DLCs coming up, hopefully it's going to get even better.

This is one of the best Assassin's Creed games ever made. I have not played or purchased an Assassin's Creed game in years because they all felt the exact same with barely any differences. This game is a straight up RPG that has a main character with a fully developed backstory that you care about. The map is massive and the combat variety is welcomining and allows people with different play styles to play the game however they want. There is less of the modern aspect of the story so the player can spend more time in the Greek world. There are so many quests and areas that I can easily see myself playing this game for 200+ hours. It's also refreashing to see that Ubisoft will continue to add content to the game for months to come. This is easily the best AC game since Black Flag and definitly worth the money.

Do not buy this game yet. Constant crashes, frame rate issues, and constant game breaking glitches are par for the course. Wait until Ubisoft finishes the game they just released first

It's the same as Orgins but at the same time not really. I like what they did with the combat. Its much more fluid compared to origins for me. The enviroment is also very beautiful. Overall I'd say its worth it so far

A breathtaking game, and for all the right reasons.

Assassins creed Odyssey strays so far from the original games, yet still manages to be my favourite, a game with endless possibilities that I can keep coming back to.

Graphically, it really does not get better than this. Stunning landscapes and seas, with an ever-present dynamic skyline and colours so true to reality. Travel the seas or explore hidden caverns, and still experience the eye-catching details that this game brings to the series. From the breaking and ebbing of waves to the glowing of a splint, graphically, this game is close to flawless. Let it be said, however, that it does require a hefty computer. Would definitely not recommend playing on a low end PC.

Second, I want to touch on the story and the characters. I don't believe that this game brings the most lovable or the funniest characters of the series, but I must say that the overall storyline is definitely intriguing. The way the assassin ancestry comes into play is very interesting, and catches you at the perfect time. Sometimes, voice acting in cutscenes is not amazing, I should add, although there are one or two well done performances among the rest. Overall, however, the story does stand out as a good one among so many rushed narratives in today's market.

Now, the gameplay and variety in this game is second to absolutely none. I'll say it again, there are no limits to what you can do. I am amazed that they managed to make the sailing and swimming experiences so lifelike, yet still have an outstanding combat system. Battles, whether large or small, are always satisfying and always rewarding, and you will never feel as though it is burdensome. Everything outfit is customisable, upgradable and there is no end to what is put in front of you in this game. In previous AC games, I have to say I was bored of side quests and bored of the constant grind. It often felt like a chore. In Odyssey, however, Ubisoft presents something so different. There are not only main quests, side quests, bounties, contracts, deliveries and more, but also a system of mercenaries and a system of occultists. Everything you do, whether assassinating an occultist or taking out hordes of Athenian ships, has an incredible reward and progression system. Everything is pointing towards a certain end goal, and so everything you do has worth and meaning. That is exactly what I have been waiting for in a large title like this.

And just as i thought the game couldn't get better, Ubisoft delivers one of the best soundtracks ever in a video game. The way it varies between an eery, intense assassination melody to an open-seas naval battle anthem is just incredible, and the music keeps you gripped and divulged in what exactly you are doing. Environmental sounds are also incredible, again immersing you into the surroundings.

So, onto the historical aspect. Awesome. I had always dreamed of living in the past, and that is what Odyssey brings to life. The Ancient Greek world is fascinating, and I believe very true. I love sailing Greek waters, bumping into pirates, Spartans, Athenians, and seeing what it really was like to live in the Greek world. Obviously, no representation can be perfect, but I really like the approach odyssey has taken to depict the legendary civilisation.

I am reluctant to say something is 10/10 because that theoretically means it is perfection, but right now I believe that Assassins Creed Odyssey is the best open world game out there in 2019, and I definitely recommend purchasing it, as it results in endless adventure and endless fun.

Do not buy if your CPU does not support AVX (Intel 1st gen). The game will not run.
Ubisoft has not said anything about a patch to resolve this yet.

Ubisoft has blown me away with this game.
Assassin's Creed Odyssey delivers hours upon hours of cleverly written quests, stunning graphics and voice acting, and thoroughly enjoyable game mechanics.
Oh, and it's all based in a beautiful and immersive reconstitution of ancient Greece.
And it's very decently priced for a "triple A" game.

I mean...What else can we possibly ask for?

The game is actually OK in the beginning but eventually becomes too repetitive.

The level scaling doesn’t work well. On the highest difficulty you get weaker with every level (long grindy fights). On the second hardest difficulty you become unstoppable at high level (boring). There is no balanced difficulty setting. I preferred the old game design, which didn’t include leveling. No leveling is better than a bad level system.

There is a lot of content. Actually, there is too much content. As a completionist, I tried to finish this (DLC included) but got bored at some point. The gameplay gets stale at some point and is not adequate for such a long game. The gameplay needs to be deeper and more complex. Even the skill trees are not fitted for the end game (you just add you skill points in some minor buffs like +0.4% sword damage).

It also doesn’t feel like an assassin's creed game, especially on the highest difficulty. At high level and max difficulty I need critical assassinations for everything (even for fragile archer). This is an example of becoming weaker as you level. Normal assassination worked fine at level 1.

The active abilities are very powerful. This is why enemies must be so durable. The active abilities are problematic as they are driving force in combat instead of a complementary part (feels like a MMO not an action game). Overwhelmed by a powerful mythological creature? The cooldown waiting game awaits! Abilities like "you cannot fall bellow 1 health/die for 20 seconds" don't belong in an action+stealth game.

This game is not only repetitive, but also very generic! So you can get bored quickly!

Conclusion: OK at first (first 40-50 hours) but eventually turns in a generic MMO experience. There is a ton of mediocre content. Might be worth playing for the first hours but not at the full price. This is a decent option if you want to waste many hours. Or you could play a better game.

I was a huge fan of Assassin's Creed.
This game is not like the old games. It is different on so many levels. But I like it. It is the best game I have played after The Witcher 3. A lot of story, many characters, a lot of things to do in the vast open world. It is almost perfect, although it is from Ubisoft! I am still a fan and I hope that they will continue to develop just like that.
I advise you to give it a try!

Assassin's Creed Odyssey isn't the perfect game.
It has various flaws, like the very forgettable side-quests but I have been having so much fun just exploring the ancient Greek world and marveling at how good the game looks and still manages to run on my old i5-2500K that I can't help but love the experience as I roam from bandit camp to bandit camp, murdering everyone to get loot and complete meaningless side-quests or advancing the main story.

One of the aspects of the game I've really liked, apart from the ability to choose to play the game as Kassandra (my choice, she's great) or Alexios, it's how some story choices have a certain effect on the world, making the player question their actions. It helps making the story feel a bit more like something we're really shaping while we keep moving forward in our quest.

The game has issues and flaws, but it's something I definitely enjoyed, something I've put so many hours into and I'm still playing as I work toward reaching the end (85 hours and still exploring all the various isles instead of tunneling on the main story because I get sidetracked so easily) since I find it so easy to get lost in it.
Definitely a recommended purchase from me.

Update 17/05/2020 original review still stands... Playing it after a year's break and liking it.

I can but can't recommend this game at the same time... hear me out.

I played Assassins creed origin's for quite some time, just under 100hrs to be exact and absolutely loved it and I feel that because Ubisoft took a break from producing one every year Assassins creed origin's was perfect but I digress.
Assassins creed Odyssey is a pure copy and paste of Origins now I know that you think "Well Odyssey must be good as well then" but I think it isn't the only thing good about it is the theme which is ancient Greece!!

if you have not played Assassins creed Origins then yes 100% buy this and play it however if you have played Assassins creed Origins then prepared to be disappointed for a copy and paste of a game like Call of duty, Battlefield, Fifa etc don't waste £50+

Definitely a buy if you are into RPG games. You may like it, you may hate it, but it has the nemesis system from shadow of mordor and that can sometimes frustrating. You try to fight a tough capitan and 2 more show up; when you thought the situation wasn't bad enough, 1 more bounty hunter joins the fight :) That's the only thing I don't like, anything else is awesome, gorgeous landscapes, lots of quests, an interesting story and the ship battle is back!

I couldn't play any AC games after Brotherhood. Same gameplay each game with minimal changes.

This game changed everything. Open world, equipment, skill tree, dialogues choices, crew, secondary quests. It's almost an RPG, even if a simple one. I can only hope Ubisoft will continue to develop future AC games in the same way.

Fascinating graphics, magnificent scenery, mythological creature, aesthetic equipment, vivid characters, addicting gameplay. These are the pros.

Occasional glitch that lets you float in mid air which ends up dying, terrains that definitely look possible to climb or jump on but can't, melee being absolutely useless in combat especially on higher difficulty, high hardware requirements, input delay. These are the cons.


It has all the elements for a good game, simply can't really ask for more. One of my favorite games.

This game sometimes feels like a chore.
There are grinds that are fun but in this game its just the opposite.

Why I Dont Like it

A lot of meaningless side quest and not fun at all to do.
And the game feels unpolished one example riding the horse just dont feel good and buggy.
(Thanks UBISOFT)
Most voice acting/dialogue is lifeless for character except, Kassandra.

The good thing is representation of Greece which i appreaciate. *and Spartan kick

Already know you cant get the old AC back :)

Returned when I realized the forced grind that was present in the mid game. They conveniently sell "boosters" to speed up XP progression. This game is using a mobile game business model by forcing grindy, boring side missions in the mid game and selling a way to speed the game up.

Obviously it is not necessary to purchase the boosters, but I refuse to support a game that even flirt with the idea of enforcing grindy gameplay unecessarily while selling ways to speed up progress. That is BS.

To give a little bit of a background on my experience with the franchise I played from the first Assassin's Creed to Unity and then stopped because I was burnt out and the story from Black Flag and Unity disappointed me (I was expecting them to wrap it up honestly or something).


The visuals,
it's very pretty and well balanced nothing hard on the eyes sometimes the light sources can become weird but it's nothing that will last usually. Also the game runs pretty well, at least on my machine I know it's not much of an indicator but at least you don't need to be scared that it's a poorly optimised game and you'll want to throw your computer out of the window.

The world,
It's very big but if you are one to explore you will quickly notice that it's quickly repetitive and will feels very empty since there are not enough side-quests that don't feel like fetch quests to do. The locations and enemies will quickly feel the same as well, everyone fight the same generally. The AI is pretty bad and their path finding is a joke to the point that it feels immersion breaking when you see it. There were mythical creatures that had their own little quest and those were actually fun to do but there are only a handful of them to beat so it's short lived. It is fun to navigate with your ship but I felt very little incentive to use it since it felt like there were very little interesting underwater content or events to do. Side note, the horse can be annoying to use when going uphill as it turn left and right randomly.

The gameplay,
that's the bad part sadly and I can't really excuse it as much as I want to love the game.

1. The combat system feels dated and at times unresponsive, I'm standing and spamming the key for an ability and it takes 5-6 presses for the game to finally react. Dodging and parrying suffers from that same randomness and I wanted to believe it was on my end but I honestly tried my damn best to do something about it but nothing. I had to resort to change my build to avoid combat as much as I could because it would drive me insane.
2. A lot of strange mechanics like you can jump as high as you want and never suffer from fall damage or abilities that makes you nearly unkillable just pushing you away from being an assassin but another fantasy game hero.
3. There is some build diversity between the Hunter, Warrior and Assassin abilities but a lot of them are sort of useless if I'm being honest so it's not so crazy like it would make you want to start a new save for it probably.
4. You are not an assassin anymore, you need a good build to do that because the game has levels and RNG loots.
5. The parkour/climbing is dumbed down way too much to the point that I don't even feel like I'm playing the game anymore, I hold shift and look somewhere and off you go, there is no jump button, no sprint button it's all with shift which is another aspect of the franchise that I loved lost. Also it stops working sometimes as my character would just not do anything and I would need to climb somewhere else or with a different angle. Lastly it will stick too easily to climbable surfaces near my character when I would run in tight spaces which led to some really clunky looking parkour or simply frustrating navigation.
6. The gear comes with rarity and random stats there are legendary items that are not thankfully but the inventory management is still annoying in my opinion and also thank god for visual customisation you don't have to look stupid for wearing pieces from 5 different looking armors.
7. The level system is pretty bad, if you are fighting an enemy 1-2 levels higher than you it will reduce your damage and increase their damage ridiculously and vice versa.

The story,
it's not a masterpiece but not bad, most characters have their charm and the storytelling is good. The main character (I played Kassandra) is likeable and everything is voiced perfectly. However like most of the game it's not really an Assassin's Creed anymore as you don't get to play much of the growing up phase. It did feel drawn out at some point if I'm being honest.

The side-quests,
20% good, 80% generic/boring and I'm not talking about the repetitive quests. Also the repetitive quests are a plague, too many and they feel as if they are only there to fuel some kind of grind added with the levels.

Side note,
there are micro-transactions but they are not mandatory however they are p2w but you can "magically" get a 100% discount on everything if you are a wizard. It's still scummy and if you are going to buy this game, just don't feed into it so they can maybe understand how stupid it is to monetise a SP game with an in-game store.


Overall, it's a really watered down AC if you can even call that an AC game anymore, it's pretty but bland in content. You are paying for the visuals more than an actual good game and if you are going to buy it despite this review do it on a big discount at least because it's not worth the money.

Review: An Odyssey

The giant boar has killed me again. What was that, the dozenth time? I lower the difficulty again, but I'm not enabling enemy health bars. I don't even want to know how much it has. How many arrows have I put directly into its face, 43? 67? It was a lot. Of course, that was before the fight even started, as I hid in a bush, trying to take it out from stealth... but you have to start the fight by letting it see you. Otherwise it won't actually take any damage, and start the long slog through multiple waves of smaller boars and makeshift bullfighter gameplay.

A bounty hunter shows up out of nowhere halfway through, interrupting the fight and providing a much-needed distraction. The bounty hunter and their pet wolf get gored by the giant boar and his little pals, but I missed one of the smaller boars, and I'm dead again. How many times have I tried this fight now?

Eventually I end up killing it easily by spamming its face with Devastationg Shots and ignoring the smaller boars entirely. Apparently it was always that easy.

Since when was Assassin's Creed about multi-stage boss fights, spamming your spacebar to dodge around while whittling away at enemies' absurdly high health pools? Health pools so high that even Spongebob would cringe in shame at some of the bullet sponges in this game, especially on higher difficulties. This isn't Dark Souls! Apparently this isn't Assassin's Creed, either.

And let's not forget the time that 2 bounty hunters came after me at level 15. After getting demolished a few times, I re-enabled the enemy level and health bars to figure out why. Both of them were a couple levels higher than me, and each would take countless dozens of hits, knicks, stabbings, bludgeonings and lacerations to kill, hitting them repeatedly for over a minute or two to actually deal enough damage to kill. Is that supposed to be fun?

It's annoying to be tracked down across the world by a constant stream of mercenaries, which makes it seem like you're being punished for simply playing the game. Sometimes one will show up nearly every mission, just to get in the way and cause you grief. Sure, you can outrun them, and apparently you can simply pay down your bounty on the map screen, but does that defeat the purpose of the entire system? When a feature is aggravating at best, it's not a good feature. The Shadow of Mordor/War games did this *infinitely* better.

The Slow Decline

After a couple hours messing around in Odyssey on Google's Project Stream beta, I was convinced I would continue to enjoy the game after purchasing it for myself. And, to Ubisoft's credit, I did continue to enjoy the game. Kind of. When it actually let me.

I started off playing on Nightmare, with as few HUD elements as possible. I wanted to have just a compass, since switching to the map to determine direction was a bit much, but of course that isn't possible to have without also showing points of interest on it.

Then, saddened to learn that Nightmare difficulty just multiplies enemies' health pools and makes them two-shot you, I lowered it to Hard. After some issues fighting higher level enemies, I enabled enemy levels. But that also shows their health bars, and every enemy gets marked by your bird while scouting, so I disabled that again.

Eventually I lowered the difficulty again to Normal, and simply settled for only playing in one region at a time, treating each like I would in a standard level-gated RPG, exhaustively clearing each point of interest, doing all side-quests for EXP and progressing to new areas only as the game (clearly) wanted me to.

For Sparta! Or not.

This game is an unapolagatic pile of contrary design that doesn't respect either the player or the platform.

This is woefully apparent when looking at basic options, like rebinding keys. For instance, you can't rebind important keys like Parry. Q is an awkward key to press while moving around, especially when you also need to hit shift to break an opponent's block.

You can disable most or all of the HUD elements in the game, but the game design makes you feel punished for doing so, because without them you have no way to tell if a single attack on an enemy is enough to wound or kill them, without getting close enough to actually do so. Tougher and higher ranked enemies are usually dressed in more extravagant armor, but wi

Want to see only enemy levels, but not health bars? Too bad.
Want those without your bird marking every target in an area while scouting? Tough luck.
Want to have a compass, but not see points of interest on it? Oh well.

And the list goes on. The HUD options, combined with the arguably weak implementation of "Exploration mode" with its painfully simple descriptions, provide the players with the illusion of choice without actually offering actual gameplay. In fact, I'd argue that disabling certain HUD elements actually detracts from the game as a whole, due to actual gameplay mechanics, Better not miss your character's warning, or you'll get slaughtered by high-level enemies in an area you're not supposed to be in yet.

The level system is the Number One cause of frustration in the game. You fight higher level stuff, you die. That's usually how it goes. It keeps you playing in the same region, progression through specific quests. The open world portion of the game isn't very open in this regard.

The equipment rarity system is borderline useless when you factory in item levels, since one or two levels is a big difference when it comes to DPS and armor, despite losing out on an additional modifier or two, which usually consist of some single-digit improvement that's otherwise unnoticeable during play.

The Conclusion

Whenever I found myself closing the game, it wasn't just because I felt my play session had come to an end, but because I'd rather quit out of frustration than deal with yet another instance of baffled irritation. That's never a good sign.
Assassin's Creed: Odyssey is an open world with invisible borders, mired in conflicting mechanics that lead to frustrating scenarios at every turn. This isn't Assassin's Creed, it's something worse... it's Assassin's Greed.

I was right on the fence when it came to giving this game a Positive vs. a Negative review, because there is just as much good design as bad, if not more. How it all works together, though, leaves a lot to be desired, and I think a Negative review is a better indication that some of us expect better.

Late to the party, on the last sale on Steam, I decided it was time to play this entry in the series. After 167h and getting 100%, here I am.
I grew up with these games and I was sad to lose interest in them after Ubisoft kept pushing one out every year regardless of quality and while the modern story after Desmond was a cringe-fest that leads nowhere. Let me reassure you, the latter it's not any better in this one.
This game is so different than what Assassin's Creed has always been.
I review it positively though because that's exactly what made it good for me.

THE GOOD

This game is so far from being an AC that it doesn't even feature assassins. In this game, you play as a misthios, a mercenary, in Ancient Grece. It's somewhat connected to the other games, with one of the expansions, but being set prior to Origins, it's not actually assassins.
This makes this game the best attempt of Ubisoft at making a The Witcher 3-like game. I think they might have taken a bit too much inspiration as the soundtrack sometimes sounds extremely similar.
The main character can be chosen between Alexios and Kassandra, and their story, or better, Odyssey is really well written and interesting. The game has a well-rounded combat system, with a nice and detailed ability tree to make your own playstyle shine, in my case, Assassin. The map is big and full of things to do. Moving around is improved by the influence of The Lend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the gaming industry allowing the player to climb every possible surface and explore with freedom, but in this case, with no Stamina limits. Quests are really good and well written, sometimes featuring also Romance options which are often just a fade-to-black while kissing scene and have 0 impact over the game. I say often, as it's not always the case, but don't expect Yennefer and Triss level of romancing. From what I understand, the devs after the launch kept adding for free more greek world story arcs that feature a few missions and are written amazingly, easily one of the highlights of the game for me, after the main story. The game has an armor and weapon system with perks and whatnot making it even easier to customize your experience. By the end of the game, I had been using mainly an Assassin build with 100% CRIT Chance and 650% Crit Damage when full health. The game also features a transmog system to always look your best while using the best armors and perks. The expansions are not the best I ever played, but also not bad and they add a new story or new maps. At the time of writing on the last sale, I saw AC: Valhalla - the latest entry - at 30€ but 90€ with all expansions and packages. I don't think these were worth 60€ and I'm sure the pricing was the same at the time. I strongly suggest this game on sale to players who have a few hundred hours in their hands and want to play a game that is somewhat RPG, more in the building the character than the choice options and consequences, even though there are some highlights.

THE BAD

On top of good story missions, this game also features the worst possible missions you could think of. The classic: go there, fetch this, bring it back. Do it 15 times more for no reward other than money. It feels like Ubisoft is scared that if there are not 100 side-missions in the game but only 30 well-written people won't think it's worth the money they ask, which is a lot including the Expansions which are basically mandatory. They may look optional, but the modern story legit doesn't end in the game but inside the second Expansion. This is not just the only scummy-live-service thing in the game. There are boosters you can buy permanently to level up easier and get more money, which seems pointless at first before you see the prices on the last ship upgrades and also realizes after level 99 it actually goes on forever giving the player a chance to min-max perks and stats outside armor and weapons. The store also sells a LOT of unobtainable-in-game Armors, Weapons, and Ship Cosmetics which are amazing to look at and cost often 15€ each, in a single-player game. There's a way to get them but it requires grinding a resource through bounties almost daily - my Destiny 2 PTSD is kicking in - and waiting for the vendor in the game to rotate and maybe selling what you want. Ubisoft is literally telling single-player gamers: "Log every day and do bounties so maybe you could buy this beautiful looking armor which looks a m a z I n g when available, ooooor...it's just 15€. It also drops at your level and is epic. ;)".
The game feels like it has mechanics that are taken away from the player for the sake of making it easier. I'll make some examples of some I really didn't like.
The enemies scale to the player at all times, there's no way to disable it and the time it'll take you at level 1 to kill an archer by attacking it will be almost the same at level 99 with 8000 damage. Obviously with abilities and builds you can break it, but that's not the point.
Starting from level 20 falling from heights has no consequences or damage whatsoever. It's not a bad option, but I would rather have a higher fall distance than no damage at all.
Another mechanic the game strips the player of is hiding bodies. Coming from Far Cry 5 I assumed hiding corpses in the bushes would work, but in reality, the AI cheats and will go even outside the camp to find the corpse and then send the alarm. It would be boring, if not that very early in the game the player can access an ability that requires only 1 point to unlock and make the corpses of assassinated enemies disappear into thin air. If you plan on playing stealth it's almost mandatory especially when the option of not using the ability is not possible as the corpses are found regardless of how good you hide them.
Not the end of the world, but I just don't understand why not build on those mechanics but instead almost "disable" them.

CONCLUSION

The game is fun, not perfect, but bought on sale it's absolutely worth it. The microtransactions should not be there, to begin with, in my opinion, but I'm not the only one thinking this way as for these games there are always Inventory Editors and what not to still get those items without paying.
Get it if you're in the mood for a really good story, some beautiful side missions, a nice combat system, and a big world to explore.

6.9/10
Not the best game I ever played, but it's not bad either if you're a fan of open worlds and liked the previous games.

What I feel they could have improved upon
I really love the bosses in this game, everything from the Minotaur to Medusa and even the animals on steroids. Although I can't help but feel like they could've made some more memorable Greek mythology creature bosses like The sirens or a Hydra.

Other than the bad talking animations where the timings don't match or it's simply bad ( Ignored the Fact though ).
The game is HUGE, 86 Hours in and I've only Finished some Add Ons, Main Story line, not even the Side Quests, some parts are not even yet explored. So much exploration and Side Quests to do, lost track of how many I've already done tho.
Some didn't like the grinding aspect or that It got pretty repetitive doing the same tasks again, but I never encountered myself doing the same tasks over and over again, always found a way of approaching each Fort with some kind of strategy, biggest challenge has to be getting the Fort without being spotted.
Love that they gave purpose for everything, the Drachmae, Wood, Leather, Gems, Metal, everything is used.

P.S. Man, Adrestia Hull upgrade is expensive as ♥♥♥♥ for max upgrade.

I have completely finished the base game and its side quests to my knowledge and this game is very much worth getting, I also finished the fate of Atlantis and am a good ways through legacy of the first blade. Fate of Atlantis is great, and legacy of the first blade pales in comparison. Like most say, go for fate of Atlantis if you have to choose. Now onto gameplay, the combat and missions can definitely get monotonous, but there are generally enough bosses with new moves to spice stuff up. Also, fate of Atlantis lets you change abilities and consequently your playstyle. The missions are all mostly enjoyable, but if you want to see how I somewhat feel about their layouts you can watch Dunkey's video on it (A lot of following missions). This game is not nearly as good as the Witcher 3 storywise but it is a really good RPG in terms of combat, grinding, and world design. I've thoroughly enjoyed it this far and am excited to move onto origins when I finish, but angry Valhalla won't be seeing an initial release on Steam.

Lets start with saying wow, what an amazing game. It has an amazing story I loved every bit of it. There is plenty to do on this game and will keep you going for hours on end. I stopped playing the Assassins creed games, but I saw this on sale, I bought the game & DLC's. It got me back in to the franchise and is a masterpiece of a game. Only letdown for me was the Atlantis DLC but overall a fantastic game. 100% buy in a sale!

I went almost all question marks, got all the achievements, finish all the DLCs because:

-I love ancient Greek and its myths.
-Map is so beautiful. Historical locations are interesting. It is fun to discover it and loot around. Colors are really awesome.
-Story is interesting. Mercenary, cultist and ancient system is cool. Mini stories can make you laugh even upset.
-Gear design is good, there are plenty of legendary gears.
-Voice acting is good.
-Character movements are well designed. Skill tree offers you different play styles as Hunter, Assassin, Warrior or hybrid.
-Let's you talk with historical characters.
-I've played first 3 AC games plus Black Flag, RPG system fits this one perfectly.

There are several endings for the game and several endings for some quests. You can find out your 'good sounding answer' can result with 'bad way'. Still choose the one fits for you, it doesn't always end with good way.
Sometimes it was boring to bring this bring that kill this kill that quests. Other than that the most annoying parts of the game (like any other AC games) for me were climbing somewhere unintentionally, missing skills, getting stuck by objects while fighting and die because of all these especially fighting against isu soldiers.


This part includes spoilers, do not read if you're new to the game.
SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER


-How ISU can dare to want you to kill Leonidas? If someone followed the option to kill Leonidas, shame on him/her!
All ISU except Poseidon are a..holes.
-After Alexios/Kassandra said 'I'm tired I want to go home' I really felt that. I really wanted to go back to see Barnabas and my crew after Atlantis.
-Kyra was the best to flirt with imo. I wish they could put her somewhere so we could visit her and talk sometimes. I tried to find her in Mykonos but she wasn't there. And poor you if she jumped over the cliff in your game. I'd be so sad if it would happen to me.
-Testicles was very unlucky malaka. And dumb. Yet his name is very funny.
-After beating Cyclops i knew I could find that goat, loot it and get the eye. I failed to get it right after the quest but randomly when I visit Kephallonia I killed one goat and got the eye from it.
-I liked every photo of Alexios/Kassandra hanging down the Zeus' balls xD.
-It was hard to choose first phobos, thank you Markos.
-One of the most annoying Cult to me was Chrysis. Leave babies alone you b.tch
-I remember I played all the quest from the beginning again to save Barnabas' nephew. In the first save he and so many villagers died. You know you should not make Barnabas sad. I'm happy to find her daughter too. I let her stay in the Villa. Maybe I should've invite her to my adrestia.
-The fake Eagle Bearer part was also so funny. That damn rooster caused more damage than my poor ikaros LOL.


My previous comment was negative when I have 30 hours of game play, due to micro transactions/in-game store. I even said I won't buy any other Ubisoft game. Guess what, I bought AC Origins after perfect AC Odyssey experience.

UPDATE: STILL an awesome game!

NOTE: This is coming from a first time AC Player.

After playing this game for nearly 200 hours and completing almost everything (except some of the tougher achievements) I decided it's finally time to write a review.

THIS. GAME. IS. AWESOME!

Firstly, let me say that the price LOOKS steep but really it's not. Normally the "Ultimate Edition" is $119.99 but that's only if you're crazy enough to buy it off-sale. I paid ~$50 for the Ultimate Edition during a sale which I feel is definitely a fair price for a game that provided me with over two hundred hours of game play.

My favorite parts of this game were exploring the wild, coming across Ancient Greek monuments (that existed in real life!) and legendary creatures to defeat as well as getting the feel for what Ancient Greece was like. That was definitely a pleasure as a history nerd with a particular interest in Ancient Greece/Ancient Rome.

The graphics of this game are extraordinary although you will need a higher end PC to play it at max settings with smooth gameplay. I played on a computer with an 8700K + 2080 Ti and was getting ~85-90 fps with maxed settings @ 1440p.

Some people have complained that the game feels too "grindy", but honestly for me it wasn't a problem at all. I didnt even feel the need to use the "2hr XP BOOST" at any point. If you've ever played World of Warcraft the leveling is much faster than in WoW.

If this is a concern to you I HIGHLY recommend going out of your way and picking up all the fast travel points whenever you can so you can get places quickly and get things done without having to ride your horse all over the map. Sometimes I ended up spending 10 minutes going out of my way to pick up fast travel points but they almost always came in handy when I needed to get back to that point later.

With 204 hours in the game my character (Kassandra) is level 70 and I just started New Game+.

All in all I would give this game 9/10.

The only downside I can think of is that the naval combat wasn't as enjoyable as I thought it would be. It seemed to be mostly luck based and relying on attacking ships only if none of their allied ships were nearby.

Fortunately naval combat is present but it's not a huge part of the game. I just avoided most ships unless I had a quest to attack them.

I absolutely adore this game. It's beautiful, the lore is enticing, memorable, and accurate. I find the game play incredibly fun! I know a lot of assassin's creed fans don't like how the newer games have moved away from being simply assassins to assassin/warriors, but I enjoy it for what it is. Both styles of combat are fun and exciting in the game. If you like greek mythology I highly recommend.

Although I enjoyed the first assassin's creed games, I think this style of game alongside RPG elements makes it a whole lot better. Hence why I've been able to play for over 100+ hours during quarantine without getting bored.

If AC: Origins and The Witcher 3 had a gay colorful baby this would be it.

Just improves everything that AC:Origins had and picks of pros from the witcher 3 such as intuitive characters with actual depth to their personalities , fortunately this perk exists even in side quests which makes mundane sidequesting a lot more fun given that the game really incentivizes going out of your way and leveling up through side quests like its predecessor Origins did.

Another perk it picks off from Witcher is creating a beautiful scenery , wheras the witcher had a dark mysterious moody theme with heavy fogs and ominous forests with vibrant buildings and cities which made for a very life like environment , Odyssey flips it around to create one of the best most flamboyant and colorful escapade into the Greek world which already inhabits the beautiful Mediterranean pallet. The buildings , the lighting , the vibrance of every area is impactful and most minor cities and towns differ from each other significantly with alot of variety to explore. Coupled with a photo mode with most of the essential sliders is a cinematographs dreams.

Combat wise the game has evolved a lot from AC: Origins fairly mundane skill and static weapon perk system. Skills can be unlocked and upgraded through levelling and adrenaline is used as a fuel to use said ability , with different abilities for all types of playstyles (Melee , Ranged and Stealth) , it really comes closer to the MMORPG type direction that they wanted to take origins in. Abilities actually stand out from each other making them unique and fun to play around with especially when building combo sets for absolutely broken builds which makes combat a breeze if you can plan and execute strategies involving the abilities well.

Static weapon perks still exists but unlike origins , armour in AC: Odyssey actually affects the stats with 5 different armour slots (Helmet, gauntlets, Chest piece, Leggings and waistband). Another system known as engraving has been implemented , this is basically equipment perks such as percentage boost to overall damage or in rarer cases perks which provide significant buffs to certain abilities. Furthermore equipment can be engraved further at a cost from a blacksmith with an engraving of your choice that has been unlocked allowing for much more customization that what AC:Origins provided.

Other pros:
-Actual ship combat from AC: IV Black Flag returns (more on this later)
-HORSIES (Unicorns , Pegasuses , Bulls , Pegacorns ie unicrons x pegasuses etc
-Game incentivises exploration with the cult hunt system which takes you all across the world
-DLC add-ons which are actually worth the cost (Legacy of the first blade and Fate of the atlantis)
-Multiple endings based on your decisions throughout the story
-Alot of things to do even after finishing the main story line , some of which really branch out to integral story parts the game doesnt even force you to do.
-Rewarding sidequests , some of which lead you to important side story objectives such as cultist locations.

Cons:
(P.S I really dont have many , this is one of my favorite games of all time)

Ship combat ! Its back YAY
Actually Edward Kenway would be pretty disappointed , variety of the ships attacks are pretty much non existant this creates a very boring gameplay loop of opening with a ramming attack to do substantial damage, throwing javelins to create weak points , shooting said weak points with arrows for extra damage , and occasionally disabling ships with fire based attacks using the adrenaline bars accumulated from the tedious gameplay loop state before. Furthermore in Episode 2 in the DLC Legacy of the Hidden blade , you get a flamethrower attached to the front of the ship which drains adrenaline to well THROW FLAME.


Premium content and micro-transaction plague: Ubisoft being Ubisoft plagues the store with micro-transactions ranging from snazzy armour sets with fairly unique perk and engraving sets , purely cosmetic ship skins and horses all the way to legendary ship lieutenants with top tier stats and worst of all .... time savers. All of this for premium currency known as Helix credits obtained only by being bought with real money. Time savers passively increase all XP / ingame currency (Drachmae) obtained , some time savers even reveal locations of points of interest across the entire world map.

other minor cons:
- Lazy animations
- Still a lack of melee combo system
- You have to have a very assassin perk centered build to be able to one-shot assassinate even minor enemies in later stages of the game without the use of abilities which cost adrenaline.

Personally i love this game , defo a worth buy along with the DLCs which IMO should just be labelled as continuation of the main story. Id recommend it to anyone who is able to welcome the open world mmorpg world this franchise is heading towards. This has been a huge improvement from AC: Origins a definite 9/10 if not 10/10 in my books.

Definitely one of the best in Assassin's Creed franchise. The amount of content provided is ridiculous. Spent a total of 100 hrs finishing the main quest line, yet to complete further side quests and dlcs. Highly recommend to purchase the Gold Edition which comes with AC Odyssey base game, season pass and AC3 remastered.

Regarding the map, Ancient Greece is absolutely breathtaking. The map designers outdid themselves again after AC Origins!

Although, I can understand why this game alienates a certain group of AC fans with its unnecessary RPG play style. Hopefully Ubisoft can address this issue for their future AC titles.

I absolutely love this game, it's everything I want in a game taking place in this era. It's got war, customization, myth, naval fights, need i say more? Hands down one of the best games ever.

Great game so far! I have not run into any "grind" as others have stated. I am simply enjoying side quests, exploring and main quests every few hours or so and am almost lvl 50. (there are main quests, side quests, and what i may deem as grind/fetch quests. I don't bother with those. plenty else to do)

Beautiful game, tons of quests, done right so far! (50 hours in) I normally don't really like A.C. games that much, but this one really hooked me! (even better that i got it on sale, but worth it at full price too!)

Good bits:

Stunningly beautiful scenery. The sheer scale of the world you can travel is just phenomenal, all of it above and below sea absolutely beautiful. I will spend hundreds of hours here.
Customizng your equipment is excellent and this system is rich
The movement is phenomenal and intuitive. You jump, climb, drop, get on or off a horse all in a way that is so fluid that I rraely move a way not intended. Fighting mechanics are addicting.
You get to have full scale naval and land battles. Province by province.
The skills systme is good, easy to reset.
The fast travel system is great
Great voice acting

Less good bits:
Some of the forced dialogue is tedious.
You always run out of arrows and rarely have enough resources to replace as much as you'd like. At least you can craft them anyplace.
Besides the beauty, you aren't really rewarded for roaming the endless rocky hills. You will find olive wood and metal, but that's it. It just feels like there should be more resources out in the wilds.
Loot - literally a dot on very specific jars. This feels a bit lazy.
Sometimes to close out a locatino you spend a long time looking for one set of supplies to burn or one loot item, that is a bit un-fun.
The flirty dialogue is a little awkward for me

I have 90+ hours on this game on Kassandra alone - finishing the Cultist - Family - and the Artifact questline. Assassins Creed Odyssey has impressed me with the stellar writing and savage humour. Look, trust me when I say this but you will go "daaaamn that was savage" when you hear Kassandra snark at dumbasses and I have enjoyed this game so so much. Unlike other AAA games that were hyped so much but gave us a barely passable game that was absolutely barebones - this is the one game I totally recommend. Whilst you may be disillusioned by Ubisoft's questionable storyline from past games, this along with Origins makes up for a lot of the stupid ♥♥♥♥ that has happened.
This is a full length game, and the DLCs haven't come out yet - I am looking forward to that. So if you're looking to kill a lot of time doing some interesting quests and being sneaky sneaky, this is the game for you. yes yes. :D
Also, play as Kassandra. Alexios can wait, but Kassandra's VA acting skills is absolute gold.

I LOVE this game. And not just because Kassandra is attractive.  My favorite thing to do in the game is to trick an enemy to get up on the roof and just kick them off to their death. It's fantastic and I've destroyed many a mercenary that way. I can understand why people don't like it if they grew up with the original Assassin Creed games, but this is one of the only AC games that I've not only finished but sunk a lot of hours into. I originally got this game with my PC on uPlay thanks to AMD, but got it again via Steam for achievements. I have about ~130 hours and counting total and cannot wait to play it some more. It's one of my favorite games!

Pros:
The world is extremely big with a lot of different things to do.
AI has been improved tremendously since AC:O.
Mercenaries actively hunt you down if you are spotted by guards or start a fight.
Combat on normal is still hard because the AI mixes up its attack pattern.
Cons:
Game crashes sometimes which results in my progress being reset a lot for missions and even locations. Happens even though I have higher than recommended hardware.

Overall 9/10.

Best in the series.
After the trailer and gameplay video released I was not sure how this game will be, so I decided to play a pirated copy first, I was amazed to see how beautiful this game is, I ordered the Gold edition. Map is huge, beautiful environment, lots of side missions, and the main story is amazing. So much stuffs to do.
This game is my 2nd fav in the series after Ezio's triology. I chose Kassandra, and her character is so beautiful. Highly recommended.

I love this game.
But not because of the franchise attached to it.

I was an AVID fan of Assassins Creed as a young lad, I bought and played every single game up to and includng Unity. When that first trailer dropped for Unity I was instantly hooked, Ubisoft had grabbed my attention and locked me in with their flashy cinematics and faked gameplay - now to be fair, I was 13, I believed everything on this earth was beautiful and a game company wouldn't release something I wouldn't enjoy. Unity was the game I realised game companies aren't above rushing games and releasing them unfinished, they aren't above predatory microtransactions and bogus collectors editions. The franchise was eternally ruined for me.

This game changed that, a glimmer, a shard, the smallest speck of hope has come from this game. You can tell real attention to detail was given, actual passion and dedication was put behind this, time and effort, things previous instalments have clearly been lacking.

I honestly disagree with the comments about this game being a grind, that the story comes to a halt at a certain point. Who do you know that played through Skyrim story first? No one does that, anyone with an inquisitve mind would be instantly drawn to the open world and the hundreds of '?' that litter their map.

I'll be honest, the voice actors certainly have their moments of brilliance, but they're nothing to write home about, the story as a whole is genuinely fantastic, minimal trips outside the animus, they've finally realised no one actually gives a ♥♥♥♥ about Abstergo vs The Angst League, so they're focusing on what actually matters.

If the Assassin's Creed stamp wasn't slapped on this, I honestly think this game would of easily stood on it's own, and been a genuine contender for Game of the Year.

Hi all,

Time to review the latest AC episode!
I have played them all, with some absolute gems along the line (the very first was mind blowing, Black Flag, Origins) and of course some episodes that become very dull very fast. AC Oddessey is in my opinion the best AC game ever created!

As usual there is the main story, a main side line (The cult), a ton of side stories, and an endless stream of short quests, often on a timer. Apart from that there is the greek world to explore as you see fit.
The graphics are fantastic which brings me to one of the coolest addons in this episode: visual armor changes and weapons. The armors are all stunning and each part has it's own appearance. With the latest patch you can now even change the appearance of your armor so you can play with your favorite bonusses on your favorite armor!

This time you play as the grandchild of Leonidas (300) and for the first time you choose gender. Pay attention though: you choose between brother and sister so the other one will play a very important role in the story, additionally, I chose male but the storylines are clearly designed for you to chose the female. Some conversations will always adress you as female so for the optimal experience, you should chose female.
So, not to spoil too much, there is your main story interwoven with a Cult you want dead. You could say it's one story, and not two BUT the fact remains that if you finished the story chances are high not all cultists are dead yet. So after the main story you can continue to hunt them down and finish them.

Ships are back!! Though not as good as Black flagg it's a much simpler and easier version. But it's cool nevertheless, you can upgrade it and enter other ships again. I was excited to see your own ship back in the game and it helps a lot to get rid of mercs ;)

Mercenaries are back again, and this time they add certain value. The best (one of...) legendary armor comes from them. they are divided in tiers now, and you need to climb the ranks one by one. Each tier gives you a serious discount in the shops. They clearly learnt from Shadow of War/Shadow of Mordor here as each merc also has strengths and weaknesses now. As in those games you can adapt and hunt them down.

Athene and Sparta are at war all over the world, and you can (and often must) help one side or the other to conquer the province by joining the batllefield. Literally! it's awesome. If you want, you can even conquer the entire world for one side. Which I did once. Because I didn't like what they did to me in the beginning of the story. Ha!

Con's

-there are still some bugs around, causing crashes and freezes. or quest bugs causing you to restart. Not many more though as the last update annihilated almost all the con's I had written down. They pretty much fixed the few things that where wrong. Well done Ubi.

-Club gear is level 5. As a ubi member you can buy these extra content for their games right? If you didn't know, it's worth it to check as it's always extra content for free. The problem is that it's low level. I didn't know that and got it when I was level 50 (the maximum at that time) only to find that the gear is lvl5, so worthless. However if you get that gear at the start of the game, you'll get a nice advantage!

That's it for con's... I had more but they updated last week and fixed the level cap from 50 to 70 (YESSS), added extra legendary fights (oh I forgot about those, well you'll see if you play :)) and stability.

Pro's


+Magnificent graphics, both in the world as your gear.
+Mercenary system as in Shadow of War.
+No fall damage!!!
+Engraving lets you "craft" your own gear with stats that suit your own playstyle best.
+content is insane. I was lvl 50 and was only halfway the stories. Now they raised the cap to 70 which is perfect.
+levelling is perfectly balanced, not too fast, not too slow. It kind of forces to really roam around and do quests which makes you see the entire world and all content. I did not rush the game and it took me around 300 hours to completely finish it.I'm sure you can rush it and half that time but it shows you the insane amount of content it has.
+no inventory issues
+excellent support from Ubi. They add daily quests, weekly legendary monsters/ships/mercs. Updates that really help and fix things.

Total: 9.5/10
Graphics: 10/10
Difficulty: easy to learn, very hard to master (the higher settings take away quest marks etc!)
Content: 9/10
Price/quality: 8/10 I admit it's expencive. But the game is worth it.
Story: 9/10

Absolutely must buy game! The best in the AC franchise for me, a good combination of shadow of war and Black flag.

Beside overall satisfying graphics and somehow few interesting side quests, game is exetrmly repetetive and boring. Going from node to node on map to get same generic crap for a thousand of times, ive gave this game huge chance, Tbh ive played close to 300 hours, but somehow i was making my self to play it, price of the game ranging between 60 - 120 euros is crazy, in my personal opinion its just wrapped up Ubisoft generic content from Far Cry and Assassin Creed with exetermly repetitve content. If you just searching something with exetermly generic and repetetive to kill countless hours then this game will fit you, otherwise for anyone else i wouldnt suggest.

Ubisoft has been really redeeming theirself recently with many amazing games. Odyssey is one of those, with a great story, interesting characters (Kassandra expecially) and a huge world to explore filled with a pletora of things to do. The game is a little bit grindy during the first hours but if you do side quests you'll always find yourself way above the recommended level. The whole cultists hunt is incredibly fun, expecially when you stumble upon one of them without even knowing who they really are. Last but definitely not least a big kudos to the voice actors, Ubisoft decided to use Greek accent and pronunciation and the result is awesome. What can I say? Malaka!

Let's start with the obvious: the game is fun, and the story is the mediocre AC style story. Grinding and micro transactions are also part of the game, exactly like SW Battlefront 2; but let's start from the beginning.

Most of the assets has been lifted from Origin; which is neither a good or a bad thing. Performances are mediocre; and considering what you see on screen, and comparing it to other AAA games like the Witcher, runs pretty well. Better than Origin for sure, so that is a win.

The choice between the 2 characters has no meaningful reason to exist. Beside the fact that in Sparta there were no women that would fight or wear armor, and not all the men were stereotype of the caveman; you are left with the same exact story; minus some differences here and there in the dialogues. Even the animations are mostly recycled; which is ridiculous, espoecially if you play as Cassandra and lift a woman in a romance scene, exactly like Alexios did. I was hoping for 2 different point of views and some differences in the story; but forget about it. So play with whatever character you like; they are both obnoxious and caricature of real people.

On the contrary, the other NPC are well done, you care about them and get a connection instantly. Voice over is nicely done, altough the accent seems to disappear at times. I just wonder why don't they just speak English (or allow to pick whatever voiceover track you like), and leave NPC speaking ancient Greek, except when they interact with you. Makes no sense to hear someone from ancinent Greece, speak in English with a Greek accent; but this is what we have.

Gameplay is fun; although, it won't last too long. You have a huge map but the activities to perform are fundamentally variation of the same 4 activities. Like in Origin, if you don't like repetitive gameplay, this won't make you change your mind.
Combat is fun and mostly arcade; once you get few skills that are quite powerful, you will mow tons of adversaries easily. Until you hit the level wall.

Yes, this game has micro transactions; as such; the grind is implemented as form of frustration for the player. It is not a game that has X difficulty, and linear progression, and micro transaction offer you the chance to non-play the game (because some people buy games to finish them ASAP, not to enjoy them, but that's their choice). Here the grind is set on purpose; you can't pass levels beyond 14; without an insane amount of grind, doing over and over the same 4 activities.

But of course, you can buy boosts, to solve the problem; so on top of the 100 bucks to buy the high tier version of the game, you need to pay another 20-40 bucks for boosters; unless you want to spend between 4-10 hours grinding for materials, money and XP to finally pass the wall and finish the last few campaign missions.

Don't get me wrong, the game is fun; but it is fun for a limited amount of time. Then it gets tedious and boring; and unless you live to play these games, and are brainwashed by the current AAA companies that release games made to frustrate players on purpose, to then make extra cash; then you will put the game down once you reach that level wall, and probably won't touch it anymore.

So, for that, I can't recommend this game; but I can say if you get it for 50-60 % off, then get it. Origin like Odissey, is not worth more than 20-30 dollars; unless they start to think that people would gladly buy extras and expansions if the game would let you progress linearly, like it used to be in the times before micro transactions.

Nice free weekend ubisoft!
I also see the DRM you implemented is extremely effective. Too bad only pirates can actually play this game, non-pirates will be greeted with a nice 'This product cannot be activated right now'' welcoming message on every attempt to play.

I was a big fan of Assassins Creed Origins and expected more of the same. What i got was something even better and that's definitely a pleasant surprise. The game is packed with meaningful storylines, adventure, and bloody action. If you enjoy open world RPGs, this game will give you what you want and it's well worth the full price.

You will see alot of people complaining about microtransactions. Ignore them. The game doesn't push it on you at all. You can play this game and never open up that tab.

Instead, focus on how beautiful the game is. The map is huge and it is incredible. The most beautiful game I have ever played. I find the combat to be pretty fluid as well, which is something ive also seen people complain about. Greek lore is something I have always loved and this game does a great job with it. Overall 10/10 and well worth the price tag in my opinion.

Piss poor performance on a 970gtx. It's supposed to run at 30fps 1080p on high settings, which it does, but changing all options to the lowest at 1080p still only gets you around 45~fps and CPU is not the bottleneck here. Will come back to rate it on gameplay if more optimizations are added or I upgrade my rig.
For now, if you have a 970 and need to play 1080p @60fps minimum, this is not a game I'd recommend.

Bought the Gold Edition as well as some of their Helix Coins to get some cool equipment packs. The game is stunningly beautiful but quite buggy. Out of 81 hours of playtime, about 30 of them have been due to being forced to replay some content again and again because there are known issues with the game randomly deleting progress in the main story quest that prevent further progress forcing you to a previous save, which can also be corrupted and rendered unplayble. As many abilities are directly tied to progression of the main story quest I can't recommend this game at this time as this is a common and known bug on PC's with no fix or workaround. Yes, tickets have been opened. Awaiting a response at the time of posting.

Played most AC games in the past three years, and finally got around to playing this one. It was quite a long adventure, but I can say I enjoyed every minute.

The visuals immediately stand out, the game looks wonderful. The cities of Ancient Greece with the giant temples, small streets, and lively squares are amazing, but so are the wild areas, with forests, hills, and valleys and of course the seas, which are once again an integral part of the game. Despite taking place entirely within the Greek cultural sphere, the devs managed to give each region their own character and atmosphere. The colors deserve special mention, the sunsets and mornings are beautiful, especially in rainy weather. Just like in Origins, many times I didn’t use fast travel and instead rode or sailed to my destination, just so I can see the world. The character animations, both of the combat, and the climbing are top-notch, this has always been the strength of this franchise. I’ll also have to mention our equipment this time: our armor is made up of multiple parts (helmet, chestpiece, etc.), and this combined with the free transmog makes for a massive fashion potential. It’s pretty unique too, as there aren’t many Greek-fantasy games out there with customizable equipment.

The gameplay is based on Origins, a stealth action hybrid in an open world, with some changes and improvements. The first big change is the save system. The strange objective based checkpoint system that has been the staple of the franchise has been changed to a normal save anywhere method. This was really needed.

Another change is that the rpg aspect has become much more emphasized. There are three main builds, archer, warrior and assassin, and you can build your character by learning and upgrading the appropriate abilities and choosing armor pieces and weapons with stats that support your playstyle. At the beginning of the game, I wasn’t a fan of this, but as I leveled up, got more abilities, I ended up liking it. They really expand your options, both in combat and stealth. As a consequence of this, whether you can one-shot someone with assassination depends on your ’assassin damage’. However, by using various assassination abilities, you can still get guaranteed kills on stronger enemies. So what was one button press in the previous games, now has gameplay added to it, which I ended up really liking.

The combat is simple, you have dodge, parry, light and heavy attack, but the various combat related abilities spice it up. It is more fluid that in Origins. As usual, there are a few bossfights and various situations where you have to fight, but the core gameplay is still ’sneak into a fort, take down guards and loot stuff’ which, for me, just never gets old. Stealth works well and it’s fun. By the way, we now have the ability to do non-lethal takedowns, both as assassination and in combat, but this didn’t feel developed enough. It only matters in specific quests, but there are situations where the game should account for it, but it doesn’t.

The ship related gameplay is fully developed here. As with the rpg system itself, this had a rough start, but once I upgraded my ship and got legendary lieutenants, I started to enjoy it. Had fun with the sea battles, but just sailing was also enjoyable. That’s quite something, considering that I wasn’t a fan of Black Flag. Sea shanties return, this time we have Greek ones. I loved them.

The mercenary system is also worth mentioning. If you get caught committing crimes, you get a bounty on your head, and mercenaries start to hunt you. They always know roughly where you are and can complicate your life and get you into unpredictable scenarios, which I actually liked. You especially have to be careful in cities, since getting into fights there can end up involving guards and civilians, which can lead to more bounty and more mercs hunting you. The aggression of the civilians is an annoying addition though. I appreciate that it encourages you to be careful in cities, but having some random peasant attack you after you just annihilated a squad of guards is just absurd. The mercenaries, the player character included, are part of a hierarchy. If you take some out, you gain rank, which gives you various bonuses, so it’s worth it to actually hunt them.

The game takes place during the Peloponnesian wars, the main character being a mercenary who sets out to find their family and to confront the secret organization which is hunting them. Of course, this is an oversimplification, as the story is quite complex and layered. I found it interesting and gripping, with memorable characters, including the main character (Kassandra for me), who became one of my favorites in the franchise. Her voice actor did a great job. Despite having serious, dramatic moments, I felt that the game is more lighthearted, has more humor than the others, which suited it really well.

Big difference compared to earlier games, it that now we can choose our response during dialogues, and in many cases this has major consequences on how the story plays out. I also liked that there are situations where a character tells you something that you have to remember in a subsequent dialogue.

Apart from the main quests relating to the main story, there are side quests, often forming secondary storylines, memorable episodes, that help flesh out the world. A bunch of historical people (Socrates, Herodotos, etc.) are also part of the story. They are a bit caricaturistic, but fun additions.

All in all, this game was a fantastic experience, and an epic journey (’epic’ is really a fitting way to describe a game called ’Odyssey’). One of the best games in the franchise.

The way-too-long Greek experience
World
Assassins Creed Odyssey has one of the largest and most beautiful worlds of any game I have ever played. The colour and vibrancy of Ancient Greece is really breathtaking. Each river looks clear and pure, and the pale limestone cliffs look like they were carved by the gods. I can tell you that every screenshot you take of this world will be wallpaper worthy, its amazing. There are loads of small, mystical islands for you to discover, vast caves to explore, and temples to admire.

Scale of open world
Herein lies my first issue with the game - the world is simply too big. I know that sounds like an odd critique, after all, everyone wants a big open world. However, in my experience there are simply too many places to visit on the map to possibly see them all in a reasonable amount of time. The sheer scale of the world also lacks depth, as I felt a lot of the world was padded with lots of hideouts and forts to just make the world look fuller. For me, if the world was a bit smaller, but had more interesting places and people to meet, in off the beaten path areas, it would feel more alive and realistic.

Gameplay
The gameplay in Odyssey is a mixed bag. The core combat system is quite simplistic and easy, but the abilities that you unlock as you progress can make it more varied and enjoyable. The parkour element of the game really let me down. Ancient Greece is not a great setting for an Assassins Creed game, simply because it was such a rural society. Perhaps if it focused on a specific city like Athens it could have worked. The lack of connected buildings in the world means you will be doing very little parkour, and a lot of horse riding from point A to point B.

Story
The main questline for the first 10-20 hours of gameplay is quite compelling. You feel driven and you really have a sense of purpose. The further into the game you get though, and the more side questlines open up, you really lose this purpose. The story gets quite boring, and a lot of the side missions are poorly designed too. Admittedly, I did really enjoy tracking down and killing the mythical beasts and monsters. I thought those missions were more fun and exciting than delivering random letters to people whose name you can't remember. The quests in the game just seem to be never-ending, and the story just drags on way too long without any emotional attachment.

History
The historical value of this game should not be disregarded either. If you can look past the usual weird Assassins Creed elements (a man requiring 5,000 stab wounds to die), you will find a really educational experience. If you are in any way interested in Ancient Greek history, I can assure you that this game will not disappoint. There are many real world places in the game, recreated amazingly, such as the Parthenon, the Athenian Acropolis, and the Oracle of Delphi. There's even a specific mode just for sightseeing and learning about all these places, which is a nice touch.

Conclusion
You'll notice despite a lot of negative aspects of the game that I have still recommended it. I think that if you can pick this game up cheap enough on sale give it a go, I would especially recommend it if you are interested in the time period, or if you just love nature. Although it's not one of my favourites, it is still a worth while experience that I enjoyed.

This game isn't a traditional Assassin's Creed game but UbiSoft nailed the world, the characters and
combat system.

Finally managed to complete the Assassin's Creed franchise. Dropped the series after AC 3 cause of the
disappointment.

Enjoy what's left of Assassins Creed before its too late.

It's the story that lured and made me addicted to this game. It may be because I love the history of Greece and I like how the game put some humor into it unlike Valhalla. The gameplay is also easy to grasp. It's such a fun fun game to play. I've played for 74hours already and still so much to complete and looking forward to it.

Let's start from the fact that it is a Ubisoft game and as we all know, they are "copy and paste" of previous chapters, not free from bugs and badly optimized code.
That said, it's not all to be thrown away, quite the opposite. The story, as always, is compelling and interesting. It lets us know how the facts happened in those years, obviously adding a little imagination to make it more exciting, but basically it doesn't distort the facts very much. And this is a plus because you learn by playing.

Why a bad review? Don't I have to buy it?
First of all, I immediately say that this is subjective and depends on the price. As I said before, the story changes but the game mechanics are always the same recycled from previous chapters (naval combats taken from Black Flag; You can remove the HUD and missions bookmarks as in Ghost Recon; etc ...), so paying 60€ seems to me like a theft. In fact, I waited for the discounts and took both Origins and Odyssey including all the DLCs for just over 40€, and let's say this is the right price until Ubisoft brings something new, but really new.
So, to answer the previous question, yes, you have to buy it, but not at full price and don't expect different mechanics from the previous chapters.

PROs
Graphically better than the previous ones and with the largest map ever.
Also in this chapter there are guided tours that teach us the past history, wonderful! But unfortunately the PROs end here.

MIDs
Horses are not that great, either with manual or automatic "driving". You can easily get stuck anywhere and if there is a small boulder to climb, they start to turn on themselves making the journey much longer than it would be if you went on foot. In fact, they are so useless that 90% of the game (look at my hours) I walked.
Throughout the game map there are 2 factions (the Peloponnesian War) Sparta and Athens. These continue to wage war in each region and it is common for regions to switch factions several times during the gameplay. Don't dare to side with only one faction is useless. A few hours later or after loading the save, you will have all regions controlled again randomly. (Anyway, side with Athens! I know that Sparta had a movie, glory, 300 men against the Persians, etc. But they were just a belligerent faction, always resolving everything with war, while Athens has always been more diplomatic and inclined to culture and democracy. In fact, today Athens is bigger and more famous than Sparta). 

CONs
The classic and old leap of faith is useless. Because despite falling from inhuman heights, the character does not die, he simply resets his life to 0 but will be cured immediately afterwards. After level 5-10 there is no more fall damage, under any circumstances. So it no longer makes sense to throw yourself into the haystacks. These have also been revised and finally fixed. Remember the old days when you ran away from an enemy and the character, instead of running away, walked into the haystacks? Here, this has been solved! Well done Ubisoft! Long last! But how was it solved? Simple, you can no longer enter in them. Only with the leap of faith (useless) but once you go out you cannot enter them again.
Due to the countless amount of game objects, such as buckets, torches, tables, chairs, stalls, etc ... escaping from enemies will be like playing Pinball, that is, running and getting stuck between various objects.
As with Origins, assassinating a higher level enemy to death is impossible. We will only do him maximum damage for the "assassin" class. Enhanced assassination can be unlocked later, but this is used by holding down a key until it charges and many, many, many times the enemy will move while you are charging, causing you to be discovered or forcing you to charge again. Especially if you don't have the ability to slow down time as soon as you are discovered. Annoying!
Mercenaries! A nice addition (also copied from Middle-earth: Shadow of War) but which is really annoying because in case you have a bounty on your head, the mercenaries will keep coming indefinitely. Often in the least opportune moments, causing only the increase of the bounty itself and consequently the arrival of more mercenaries.
It does not end here! This feature is really bad because if you kill someone in the presence of another person, the bounty will increase even if you then kill the witness. It doesn't make sense, the witness didn't tell anyone about my murder! (as happen in Red Dead Redemption 2). To conclude with the mercenaries, the icing on the cake is that as soon as you have a bounty on your head, one or more mercenaries will "appear" nearby you. Even if you are in the middle of the woods on an isolated mountain. If you run away (with fast travel) the mercenaries will always follow you, as if you have a GPS tracker. Example: You have killed people and now you have the bounty, a mercenary appears a few meters away from you, run away and take a fast travel 8 km away, silently enter an enemy camp, kill an enemy WITHOUT BEING NOTICED, and here is the mercenary comes running into that camp and starts walking around there waiting for you to make a false step. But why? Nobody saw me, how does he know that I'm here?
Finally, worst CON of all, I have an Intel i9 10900k fixed at 4.9GHz; GPU MSI RTX 2060 Ventus; 32 GB DDR4 RAM; Game inside an SSD Samsung 850 Evo; but the game, in the presence of many NPCs, has a frame drop from to 50-45!! While the CPU is used at 20% and the GPU at 60% (with ultra graphics). The same problem also occurs with graphics at a minimum and 800x600. After several researches and support tickets it turned out to be a game engine bug, incompatible with high-core CPUs. In fact, by installing the game on another PC with i7 6700k CPU (2016); same GPU; SSD; etc ... the game does not have frame drops, but the CPU is used over 50% with all cores active. While on my i9 10900k only 6 cores out of 10 are used and there is no possibility to force the use of all 10, making the game unstable in the presence of many NPCs where everyone has a scrip to run. Such as walking, shopping, talking, playing, dancing, etc...

Basically, it's not the best of the Assassin's Creed chapters, but it's not the worst either (Rogue I'm talking about you). Personally, if I had to choose, I prefer Origins, graphically simpler but with far fewer bugs and above all the story involves more. In Odyssey, everything seems to be there "just for play" and you have that constant feeling of not being involved in the story. And this, in my opinion, is the worst thing in a videogame, not being attracted to it, to the story, to the narrative ...

AC:Odyssey is a simplified third person action RPG with typical AC mechanics. I do not consider it a full RPG as it lacks some depth but it is not as rigid and limited as previous games from the AC franchise were. I stopped all AC games I played before at some point because I felt too limited to what I can do and it always got boring at some point. I always felt sad about it since I really like what AC generally has to offer. Odyssey significantly increased in that point by including more traditional RPG elements. But it also makes use of the typically top class AC presentation. The character animations and the freedom of movement are perfect as usual. Also the integration of Greek mythology and the appearance of historical figures in the story (but please don't mention Alexios, the misthios, in your next history class) into an almost perfect world are very well made as for all AC games I played before. The world looks so nice, truly believable.

What I like most is that AC: Odyssey allows for multiple playstyles. I personally prefer the exploring playstyle. I like to walk around discover everything (and there are many points of interest, literally everywhere) and occasionally do some quests or follow the story. This playstyle is perfectly viable; I was really surprised to see that. Exploration gives you enough experience to level at a decent speed to easily keep up with difficulty of new areas or the main story.

If you are not into that, the game offers a lot of (smaller) side missions (in the form of boards or NPCs in the cities. Also, player created content and in the form of stories or (daily) challenges can be accessed from everywhere. So if you don’t like exploration and would rather level by doing quests, that is also possible.
I consider it more an RPG ‘light’ than a real RPG. The quests are pretty linear and I am not sure I have seen real choices so far. It also still has a ton of action and assassinations. It is still a game of the AC franchise, do not forget that. At first sight, AC:Odyssey offers a huge amount of weapons and armor (and also of different quality). However, there are no different armor types and all weapons of the same level have the same DPS so you should rather focus on the extra benefits coming from these. They all look different, though, when equipped. A nice feature is that you can upgrade them to keep using them when you levelled up.

AC:Odyssey has a few draw backs as well, only minor ones, though. I cannot really understand the sheer amount of brutality the AC games always require. Yes, you are a misthios (mercenary) but is it really necessary to brainlessly to kill every single being that crosses your path? The main character seems to be a nice person, you can see that in the dialogues. I seriously doubt this man/woman would really be such a ruthless murderer. You can take over a region and just start killing the people you helped conquering the region…

Secondly, I do not really like the shipping part of the game. I understand, Greece is a country with many islands but for me it does not fit into the game. I prefer going everywhere on foot and try to avoid the ship as much as possible. It also plays heavily like an arcade game and feels very unrealistic.

So if you like third person open-world RPGs and typical AC mechanics but also Greek mythology, AC:Odyssey is definitely a recommendation!

At the core of it, I can probably sum this up like: Dynasty Warrior's Creed. The combat is simply not fun. You go in to a war, you smack the hell out of generic indistinguishable soldiers. After dozens of them, Generals appears and smack the hell out of you. You reload, trying different combination of pressing 1, 2, 3 ,4 to beat the damage sponge (At some point It become so annoying and awkward to play especially in front of other people since some of the enemy will have literally 2 audio scream file used over and over again... the exact same vibes playing those NES game back in the day when you kick the enemy and you go like HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH) .I have played many assassin's creed titles but this is by far the most disappointing combat systems I have seen in a long time and most of the review here overlooked the problem or not even mention it.

Bought this game on sale not expecting much because I fell out of love with Origins and never ended up finishing it. 87 hours later I've completed the 3 main storylines and a bunch of sidequests and I can confidently say this is a great game. While I do think it is more of a separate RPG game than an Assassin's Creed game (many of the core AC features are absent), Ubisoft nonetheless did a terrific job with this game. The game world is absolutely stunning and is very diverse across different regions of the map. The plot of the game is decent, but the characters of the story are great and easy to get attached to. The one red flag with this game is that it is very demanding in terms of performance; my GTX 1060 could only get 50-60 fps on medium settings.

Odyssey is an amazing game as a separate product that has nothing to do with the original franchise, and if you can only treat it as such, you will be lost in the ancient Greek world which has been designed to awe. I would rate this game highly even only due to the fact the great part of the game was built to reconstruct real-life layouts of the Greek cities and temples, and many pieces of art and statues are 1:1 copies with amazing attention to detail. There are historians publishing their own in-game video tours on YouTube. As a video game, Odyssey is a bit arcadey and won't give you the same experience a Witcher game would or any other more complicated RPG, but if you want to see something beautiful and maybe even learn a lot, if willing, I strongly recommend Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

This is a novel RPG and I can stand by the game and defend the game as that, but I cant defend it as a assassin creed game as it strays from the franchises original intentions and mechanics. The game is absolute beutiful and it is a very fun and easy to get lost into. This game if you play it like any RPGs and so fourth you will enjoy it, there is a bit a long pause at certain segments of the game where the story or main quests your under leveled and barely could keep up without having to go out of your way to level your character a little bit, as in side quests or taking on various tasks. But it isnt impossible to go through the game being under leveled to the mission, its just alot harder and cheaper tatics come in where its just like hitting a tether ball and seeing if it doesnt hit you back. Im glad with both the male and female choices being an option because it does change up the story line by a bit which is pretty cool. For all the Ac outside the greek world is probably the weakest part of the game as the game takes you out of this world of the greek world in crucial plot points in the game, then the main character has a long expedition with making a three sentence synopis of the passed 20 missions of the games. I recemend this to someone with alot of time and alot interest in trying in a new acient envoirment as this game made me wanna learn about the times portrayed in the game.

Beautiful & stunning world to explore!
DLC pretty worth it~
Combat is alright but level scaling makes bit annoying tho
Makes me more interested to learn Greek Mythology & its history overall

It's a different take on the AC Franchise. I can see why some would be upset that hidden blades don't exist in this game, and how some of the elements of this game are more on the ... Mystical side of things. However, if you look at the story, it's pretty important, because it's establishes how the AC Franchise came to be.

It's a good game overall! Enjoyable content, story driven, and fully dependent on your choices. Even in places you don't expect it.

This game is really long, around chapter 4 you might get a bit burnt out if you grind a couple hours a day. Overall the story was good though, grinding levels is a tad annoying at the end, but you can do enough side quests (and they're pretty fun) to get the level high enough to finish off main quest pretty quick. Took me 70 hours to beat the game, that includes beating the main questline, and all the main side quest lines. This also includes hours of me exploring the Greek cities and reminiscing of Black Flag and just getting into massive naval engagements. I would recommend.

After 62 hours, finished main story and a bunch of side stuff, along with half of the Fate of Atlantis DLC - i'm actually tired of this game. Artificially lengthened missions due to extra meaningless steps and travel time from point A to point B is astonishingly jarring. Don't get me wrong, i did like it - when you actually get to do stuff it's very fun and hard to put down. From quests and side missions to mercenery and cultists hunts, exploration and sea battles - all of which is simply good. But as of now, i'm done. I do recommend Odyssey at discounted price as it offers dozens of hours of fun, amazing scenery (especially Elysium), and decent enough challenge on higher difficulties, but still tires you out and makes the game feel like work.

I've never given AC series a proper go, until Origins, which i actually prefer over Odyssey, and after beating these two games, i do want to check the back catalogue of the series, even if my order is all messed up.

Hope Valhalla loses all the bloat, but retains and improves upon all the interesting aspects.

I cannot say I wasted my time with AC Odyssey and its addons but I surely feel like Ubisoft didn't respect my time.

The world is beautiful, one of the big strengths of all Ubisoft games but I swear, if I have to climb one more tower, clear one more generic cave/camp/outpost/stronghold or hear the cry of the eagle one more time while diving in a haystack I'm going to lose it.

I hope Gods&Monsters not only copies the Breath of the Wild artstyle but its open world design as well.

Combat is fun at first but becomes business as usual if you are going to spend as much time with the game as I did.

Story is not worth talking about, side quests and part of the main quest can be good fun from time to time though.

Graphics and sound/voice are superb.

If you are going to play one modern AC part, which I think is enough, I would highly recommend playing AC Origins instead. The Egyptian/desert setting is more refreshing and the main character(s) more interesting and likeable.

And I'd recommend to enjoy the game and the world in episodes. If you got enough just put the game aside and come back a few days/weeks/months later and enjoy the game again.

I love the story line. Even after finishing the main story there are lots of other stories you can complete. The season pass is also really worth it. You get tons of extra content to play. The graphics are really nice too but the game asks a lot of your PC if you play it on high graphics.

I haven't had this much fun playing a game in a while!

After playing Valhalla I still think Odyssey is way better..

I really enjoy all the combat in the game. Assassination is also fun sneaking to kill enemies trying not to be detected. Also enjoy naval battles. Have not played previous AC games. Though I am a bit confused about no story as why I am killing both Spartans and Athenians with no allegiance or reason other than being a mercenary/assassin. I am just arbitrarily murdering both sides. The main story is okay apart for it feeling a bit silly a few times.

I previously had a bad first impression with the game (see note below). Was having difficulty fighting with the first bounty hunter tracking me. He was level 5 and I was at level 4. Was still new to the combat controls and my reactions were poor. But now I have developed my skill in combat.

Previous review:
Just started game on easy difficulty and just playing for the story. For some reason the first bounty hunter tracking me down knows where I am at all times after a certain point. I try meditating to pass time hoping he would go away. I tried running away with my horse to somewhere far but he still manages to track me. I was stuck at level 4 and the bounty hunter is level 5. He kills me every time he catches up to me and I fight him. I was lucky to beat him once while I was level 4 and tried to repeat defeating him again reloading save before I kill him, so far I have not succeeded. Sure comment about my fighting skills but there must be a way to avoid encounters with the bounty hunter while doing other quests. I'm unable to gain XP because when I try to do quests he somehow knows where I am and unable to accomplish tasks related to quest. I would not like to experience this bounty hunters seemingly clairvoyant as to where I am on the map. It seems that there may be a bug or something that points my location to the bounty hunter not by design. I will play the game more to see how other bounty hunters are. If they seem to be clairvoyant as to where I am at all times, then I would highly not recommend this game. Very annoying.

Never played Assassin's Creed games before, and am generally a light gamer. This game, however, I immediately was interested in because I could play as a woman, and could also pursue anyone of any gender, which is cool. Playing on the PC with and XBOX One controller and it's delightful. Would recommend even for casual players. Can't wait to play more!

Fist game of the series i played, so i don't feel disappointed at all.
- Graphics are great. 9/10
- Gameplay is great. 9.5/10 the game is very rich on content, no place feels like any other. Combat is good and very diverse. Mythical creatures, naval battles and more.
- Story 9.5/10 its very compelling, i don't know how it fits the previous games but, on its own its epic.
- Music is epic 10/10
Overall i pretty much recommend the game!

After bashing my head against the wall a few hundred times I lost enough IQ to finally enjoy this wonderful game. I can't remember yesterday, or my name which means I can't remember the other assassins creed games and how this one is a downgrade and a witcher 3 ripoff that's but actually bad. Also can't remember spending money to get the xp boosters just to not deal with the grind. Overall this game is great at least a 5/10.

Around 200 hours out of my 300 is just grind. The side quests are pretty interesting, however, the random question marks on the map which contain side activities like "Travel to location X and kill Y number of Z type enemies and loot 3 chests" get really repetitive and boring. Especially because some of these locations are really far and they make the game a horse-riding/sailing simulator, and this is AFTER you have fast traveled to the nearest location possible.
The graphics are a masterpiece.
The story is a masterpiece.(Unpopular personal opinion).
The story of the Fate of Atlantis DLC is great.
The story of the Legacy Of The First Blade DLC is a masterpiece.(Unpopular personal opinion). I like that the protagonist is forced to settle down and have a child because exploring GENETIC MEMORIES was the whole foundation and concept of the franchise. So, furthering your bloodline just made sense.
The Discovery Tour is simply too good and the effort put by ubisoft into detailing is commendable.
Also, Alexios>Kassandra even though I like them both. Layla Hassan sucks though.

AC:O is the latest in the Assassin's Creed franchise that's of a totally different style as compared to the older AC titles. With this, there's a greater focus on a larger open-world exploration RPG similar to how Witcher 3 is played, with a map spanning a great expanse along with multiple side quests, as well as multiple similar mechanics.There's an effort in making the world feel alive such as through patrolling guards, as well as a bounty hunter mechanic where you rise through the ranks, similar to the one found in Shadow of Mordor.

The main campaign here is just good enough to keep you going and has some decent surprises packed into it, with different major overarching narratives. The majority of side quests had some flair added to them, similar to the ones found in Witcher 3, and were often worth doing. However, some of these got repetitive after a while so don't expect them to be the best.

Overall, the game is extremely beautiful and well optimized, while loading screens were minimal and well hidden, with proper loading often only had when you quick travel. The game's definitely worth a play but get it while it's on sale, perhaps not at full price.

Main game
9/10
The world of old Greece it's really nice to discover, the main story it's linear but your choices really impact your game. Alot of secondary quest but sometimes they got very repetitive. The gameplay it's good, alot of skill and way to play it. The Cult of Kosmos it's a great mode to make you hunt to "save the world"

Legacy of the first blade
10/10
Only a part of the Greece and not the best of it, but the story is better, learning about first proper assassin it's great. The new ancient order it's nice to follow but the region it's too small i think.

Fate of Atlantis
Part I Field of Elysium look's great but you need alot of patience with climbing, the story it's short but nice, the intrigue of love in greek gods life it's enterteining, 9/10
Part II Underworld it's look really like the place where you would't want to go, meeting with old greek hero, and helping Charon will keep you bound to game.10/10
Part III Atlantis it's amazing, the story it's short, but it's get you to the end.10/10

I bought it on Uplay with the Gold Edition. It worth every penny. It's an RPG game which will consume most of the time to level up and get epic & awesome items. You need to grind to level up faster which also makes the game easier xD Beware of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boars, wolf and chicken.

Great game, very engaging. If you want a lot of stuff to do, pick this up. If you like a grind, pick this up. It isn't TOO grindy, but there is still a grind. I find pretty much everything about this game is great except for a few things. One, the animations when killing people aren't as polished as they could be. Two, I guess this goes along with one but the game could use a little more polish. The big gripe though, it doesn't affect gameplay but it is kinda scummy, is the fact that you can literally buy your way to a high level with high level gear and stuff with REAL money. The cosmetics cost money, but I don't care as much about those since they do not affect gameplay. I do wish you could buy them with drachmae. The pay-to-win system is scummy, but the game plays fine if you do not spend a single penny. I may buy a cosmetic, but it feels wrong to have a pay to win system in a full price AAA game. Great game though.

The one writing this review is not the person of this account. I am his brother, who got enough money to buy the game for both of us. Mine crashed whenever I started it up, so I got a refund. His worked, so we played on separate save files (which is very helpful if you have siblings or friends who also want to play). This game would be a 9/10 in my book. You can play it many times in a different way and a different way of approaching a problem. I love having a choice to influence the game, and although many choices don't matter, many do and can change the game a bunch. The end.

Diary: Assassin's Creed Odyessey

Day 1 - 2/16/2020
It looked like an "assassin game" where you are a character that could have been from the movie 300, so I was like, why not. The game right out of the gate made me feel awesome since you get to play as Leonidas right away. The leader of the Spartans wrecking your enemies in huge numbers with powerful abilities. This provided a nice taste of what end game character would feel like and, at the same time, let me enjoy some of the skills offered in the game.

Once I picked my character, I was off on my wild adventures, of just doing random side missions for people on the island, and having fun messing around. I like how they mapped out this game. It looks like there is plenty of islands to explore. The game seems dang nice, I must say.

The eagle is my best friend. He swoops down and murders animals for me. He scouts areas for treasure, enemies, and collectibles. The eagle is so dope to use, and I enjoy seeing how he does infinity more damage than me when he randomly swoops down and kills an animal.

The horse makes going from point A to point B simple and easy. You can relax, sit back, and have a sweet little snack while you wait to reach the destination point. I was just chilling, talking to my friends while I was expecting to do a quest on the other side of the island.

Some of the choices in the game are pretty rough when it comes to how you want to handle a quest. For example, there was a sick family that the doctors didn't know how to cure and wanted to execute to prevent the sickness from spreading. I had to choose between letting them kill the family or siding with them to save the rest of the island. The choices in this game are not so clear cut, which makes choices more meaningful as a result

I like how when a plot twist was revealed as I was leaving the first island, even the music was like "OH OH OH OH" I thought it was rather a comical moment, Like what the heck game, how am I suppose to take you seriously, with timing like that you should be on a comedy show!

Day 2 - 2/18/2020
It's time to be a captain. Son of a gun, I fought a lot of boats. Today, I didn't even bother to go to any islands. I just wanted to keep rampaging across the sea and attack random boat weather they were a faction or a trade boat, it didn't matter. I'm stealing all that loot to craft my arrows, upgrade my equipment, and make my ship even stronger. Stealing captains off other ships is also a fun way to increase the strength of your crew.

Day 3 - 2/21/2020
Today, I learned how to wage war against the other factions. It was pretty nice that I could pick what side I wanted to fight for and cause chaos until they were vulnerable enough to go into a huge battle royale match, destroying several of their captains until they lost. It also gives you nice rewards, etc. There is always that nice benefit too!

Overall the game is a 7.5 or 8 out of 10 for me.
The story isn't anything special but it isn't bad, and feels complete with both dlc.
The expansion of the lore is quite good as well.
There are a few bugs but everything is minor and not gamebreaking.
Performance and graphics are about the same as Origins.

Good story line
Great gameplay
Good replayability for people who value progression
Only downside is the skill tree that felt pretty restricted, does not offer much variety
IF you are not familiar with the AC series, do not be intimidated by this because you need only to watch a summary bla bla bla good game

This was a good update to Origins when to comes to combat and gameplay. The setting was a wise choice and I had a lot of fun grinding. Although the modern-day storyline could use more development, Alexios/Kassandra's storyline was enjoyable. I was a bit worried when Ubisoft decided to implement the dialogue trees, but it was executed well. This massive RPG change has rejuvenated the series to the point where I am still excited to see what the devs have planned for the next game.

Loved it. Very epic in scope and content.
I played just one of the Assassin's Creed games for awhile in the past and didn't like it since it seemed more of mainly a stealth game.
This is very open world and sure at least for awhile you want to do stealth at least to get your opponents down to a sizable level before you attack an area, you don't have to specialize it it. You can focus more on a fighter and/or an archer role too.

The attention to detail, the graphics and audio are amazing.

The only thing I didn't like was the length. Felt like the game was too long for my tastes but then again I strayed away from the main quest line for a long time just exploring and pillaging many of the enemy camps, leveling, etc.
The game is so large there are several areas I never got around to exploring.

Gets frustrating at times trying to find locations mentioned in quests. Sure don't want to put a marker down for area's you haven't to been yet okay, but then if they would at least have it where if you clicked on a quest location it would have been nice to have it at least move the map to over the island or area where it's located. Many times I found myself shuffling around the map to find places by name trying to read the text with icons obscuring the view (it's not like I had ancient Greek cities memorized)..

At any rate you certainly get your entertainment dollars worth with this game.
And for those that want to play forever, looks like the game never ends. There is an additional quest line I didn't complete and there were seemingly countless more missions to do, etc.

Just a comment for the guy who played 32 hours and said the game forces you to buy micro-transactions.
Look at the number of hours I have put in: I have not spent a dime on this game after having bought it. Gg.

Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey truly is an incredibly entertaining game that proves ''Origins'' was no fluke. No longer a simple stealth game, but instead a massive, detailed, sprawling roleplaying game. Odyssey just might be one of my favorite games of 2018 so far.

This game was thoroughly enjoyable i still have a lot of the side content to play though however after completing the main story the game feels like it is complete. i haven't played the DLC for the game but the base content alone feels as if it is a full game, which is a nice change compared to some triple A titles. The story is gripping and the game is a lot more stable then Origins

It's like Deus Ex:Mankind Divided, Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Pillars of Eternity II:Deadfire got together and had a gargantuan stunningly beautiful baby. Granted, a few of the choke points in the main story line are unnecessarily grindy, but luckily the overall world in the game is engaging enough that as long as you're not in a huge rush to complete everything, you don't need to worry about that too much. And of course, stealthing around and methodically assassinating enemies one by one never gets old, does it!

It took me 134 hours to fully complete this game.

I loved every second of it.

In my opinion, there are exactly two downsides of this game:
- Enemies can take damage, and most of the time they do
- The sound design of the game can sound off at times, especially in combat

Apart from that, there is so much attention to detail and so many multiple paths to go depending on your choices. This game will make you laugh. This game will make you emotional. This game might make you cry at some point. It is an amazing rollercoaster to take; you will definetly get your moneys worth out of this game.

Lost my girlfriend in the process of finishing this game lol

Bought the game on release with the season pass included after I finished Origins and was amazed by what they managed to do with the series. This entry of Assassins Creed has to be the best one for me. Years I have said that the original Ac was the best...well times changed and so is my opinion! Assassins Creed Odyssey does above any other entry of the franchise. Graphics are too good for a game to have, music is incredible and the gameplay itself is 10/10 for me. Ubisoft managed to create something truly amazing with this one, dont miss it.

This is a review of the latest Assasins Creed game, Assasins Creed: Odyssey.

Intro:

Assasins Creed: Odyssey, was released October 5, 2018. It is the next game after Assasins Creed; Origins, which came with a new combat system, and a new way to treat the Assasins Creed series.

Gameplay:

The game mechanics have improved a lot from Assasins Creed: Origins, which, with its new combat system, completely changed the way you play Assasins Creed. The game captures the beauty of the new combat system, combined with the naval combat system from Black Flag (in which they definitely hit the sweet spot on this game). The RPG elements in it with levels and gear also makes it a bit of a grind, which i love. Because you just can't go into any mission and expect to beat if, because you now can be 10 levels under the recommended level, and you WILL die!

And if you're worried about having nothing to do in this game, do not worry, this game got you covered. As seen i got around 60 hours in game. In this time i only have completed what the game has to offer for main story quests. There is still a lot of side missions, and also DLC's (if you got those). All in all the game has a lot too offer in content, and the game does well to make you interested all the way through. Even though that after ending the main story line the travelling becomes tedious. But just remember to do the synchronisation, then the travel part is not so bad. (You normally get all around with the main storyline, so don't worry)

Pros
- A lot to do
- Combat system and naval battle
- Big map
- Great characters and story

Cons:
- Travelling becomes tedious after doing main story line
- Sad because of doing wrong decisions! :(

Conclusion:

Great game, and would recommend buying it. Sadly steam sale ended, but would still recommend it for it's asking price before steam sale.

The main story and side missions have been an absolute joy and the boss fights have been incredibly interesting and different enough to keep you pulled in each time. Graphics are absolutely beautiful and I have enjoyed the photo mode so much!!

AC Odyssey is one of the best games I've ever played. A fully immersive recreation of Ancient Greece, this game allows to play as Kassandra the misthios (mercenary) as she goes on adventure and tries to find her family. 9.8/10

Took some quest on killing a boar,
proceeded to die for about 49 times (yes I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ counted) in the next 2 hours,
and was on the brink of rage quitting.

On the last time,I had a stage 4 bounty on me 
and I lured the mercenaries to the boar.

They massacred the boar and its little piglets to pieces.
*cough* easy quest *cough*

10/10 would lure again.

The Assassin's Creed series has drifted far away from it's roots, but that's a good thing.

This is by far my favorite entry into the series, which speaks volumes about the quality of this game considering I'm an Ancient Egypt buff and by all accounts should worship the triple AAA polish and attention that went into Assassin's Creed: Origins.

With that said, the implementation of RPG mechanics paired with the fluent action-adventure gameplay gave this series a steroid injection of new life that truly makes Odyssey a masterpiece that is able to not only reach the bar set by Witcher 3, but also surpass it in some areas such as environmental and character details that could only be accomplished with today's technology.

Big deal to buy gold edition with 50% discount.

After finishing all DLC's UPD:
The story is WTF?!

By Ubisoft‘s standards, the Odyssey has already exceeded player expectations.

At first I did not like the game, but after a few hours of gameplay it started to be quite nice.

Forgive my grammar.

The Story is pretty good, the Combat feels nice , i really miss the old AC assassinations and stuff but still... the RPG combat feels is kinda nice, The Graphics are pretty cool , Every month the addition of story and new stuff keeps entertaining and i really find it Re playable.. Overall i find this game really nice With all the Ship Combat , skins and stuff and nice story , And you can find some people who made really good stories too with the story creator... but sometimes the daily quests feels repetitive.

I played a lot more of this than than I expected. I really enjoyed Cassandra as a character and the Greek tragedy story line for her, it felt different than other assassins creed games because you can make choices and the game has a lot of dialogue for you. Gameplay wise it feels a bit more action role playing than earlier stealth based games, but when you're silently killing Athenians one by one in a huge camp it still feels like being an assassin. Powers and abilities are much stronger now than in other games, but still felt very fun. What got me really into the game is the beautiful world, and there is a lot of it to explore. The Greek architecture and colorful statues made the game feel bright and colorful. The DLC levels have a more artistic and mythological take on the setting.

I will start with Pros,

Pros:
+ Good graphics, gameplay and story
+ Naval Battle
+ Female/Male protagonist
+ Combat system is a big improvement, not as clunky as Origin, also Combat animations are quite good
+ Comfortable movement, not as smooth-like as Unity or Syndicate (smooth like both came with input lag, and heavy movement, pretty uncomfortable), also good control layout.
+ Unique stealth kill animations
+ Gear visual customization
+ Good optimization, I don't have any problem with fps, unlike Origin.

Cons:
- Forced romance (If you guys know what I'm talking about)
- Character emotion (Ubisoft need to do something about this, you can see it when Deimos laugh, it doesn't look good at all)
- Long loading time

Stop complaining about Microtransaction, you can make your character impossible to be killed by improving your skills, equip the right gears and make a optimized build which fit your playstyle. Epic Gear is the best gear which can help you stronger, try to find gears with CRIT perks, also learn how to parry and dodge. This game is really easy, even on Nightmare, and what I said before could help you a bit. I've seen too many people complaining about Microtransaction, but for me, I don't have any problem with that.

First Assassins creed I've played and i have to rate it a 10/10

I felt the story was great had plenty of content and didn't just drag on it kept you wanting more!
There are plenty of side quests to take up some time when you want a break from the main story
and definitely worth it to help level up so you don't get behind level wise

Graphics are amazing
Game play is great not to clunky, felt nice and smooth
Loved the little choices you could make that would impact the rest of the game like killing someone
or taking someones money instead of just doing a service for free

Will recommend this to anyone who loves to play open world RPGs and assassins creed of course

This is the first Assassin's Creed game I've played since Revelations came out way, way back. I know, I've probably missed out on some gems that came after, but I am particularly interested in the Ancient Greek setting so when this one was announced I was keen to try it out. Now that I have, I can safely say that it is quickly getting a spot in my Top 10 games, and there's some fierce competition in there.

I'm way out of touch with the modern-day side of the story, so I'm glad that doesn't play a major role in Odyssey. (And when it does it's like watching paint dry, so no big loss.) Otherwise the game world, which encompasses most of Ancient Greece, is incredible and well worth exploring. Sailing the Aegean on the Adrestia, your very own Trireme, is amazing and the ship combat is excellent. Nothing is more fun than ramming a ship and cleaving it in two, or boarding and Spartan Kicking the captain over the side! xD There's never a shortage of things to find at sea or on land, which for someone like me who enjoys the exploration and discovery side of games is a big plus. You can dive down to find shipwrecks and sunken temples, fending off sharks and finding treasure, as well as explore caves and ruins on land. Everything feels meticulously detailed with stunning visuals; I even saw a little frog hopping around on some rocks in a village, and little things like that make the world come to life. Some of the caves feel like they have been marginally recycled, but it's not enough to be a big distraction.

Odyssey (as its name suggests), offers you unlimited freedom in how and where you let your adventure unfold. Fine, there are certain regions that may be too high level when you first start out, but nothing is stopping you from going there. In a sense, this is good; you have to be more careful in these areas, using stealth to get around or simply not causing any trouble whilst you are there. I also love how the whole world is interconnected like a giant web: you can do a side quest somewhere and discover new locations which lead you to new characters and new quests. For example, I went to the island of Euboea with the simple intentions of killing a cultist. I did so, then went to the nearest city, Chalkis, to sell some of my gear and upgrade what I was using. There I started a side quest where you have to help this slave and his master put an end to a crime ring called The Dagger. Whilst investigating, I ended up having a big bounty placed on me which meant I had three mercenaries looking for me. As I was completing one of my investigations, the three of them found me and ganged up on me (interesting really, as I think they find you by tracking your last movements, rather than they automatically know where you are.) An epic battle ensued in the ruins of Eretria, with me killing all three mercenaries and a pet lion that was tagging along with one of them. By then I was pissed at still having such a high bounty on me. I finished up the side quest and went to my map to see who the sponsor for my bounty actually was. (That's how bounties work in this game - there is someone in the world, a tangible character, who has put the bounty out on you and can either be paid off or killed to remove it.) Turns out the sponsor was the leader of the Abantis Islands, a Spartan warrior who I had considered having as a Lieutenant on my ship because of the bonuses he gave. I was a little sad because I couldn't afford to pay off the bounty what with upgrading my gear earlier (drachmae is easy to get in the game but quickly disappears when you have stuff to improve, like your gear and the ship), so I resigned myself to saying goodbye to him by ending his life. One assassination later, and I'm amazed to find that this guy was a member of the cult I was hunting, and that by killing him I am one step closer to unveiling more members that need assassinating. Two birds: one stone. Hard to think that I wanted him on my crew and then he turns out to be one of the evil ones. Skylax the Fair my arse! xD Still, this shows just how intricate this game is and how unexpected twists like this make it all the more enjoyable to play.

I've seen reviews that say the voice acting is bad - in some cases, yes, it can be. But I think most of it is more funny than anything else. Some lines are recycled for bounty quests where you have to go to X location and kill X number of people/creatures, but there are so many of these that it's to be expected. At least the actual side quests and main story have original dialogue. As for complaints of the game being grindy, I have had no such experience, possibly because I play games slowly and like to do as much as possible in one place before moving on. If you rush through the story, not bothering to do side quests and explore, then yes I can imagine the game will become grindy because you haven't levelled up enough. However, if you play the game as it is intended to be played, by taking your time and immersing yourself in the world and its characters, you will find your experience all the more satisfying. My only gripe is that combat becomes a heck of a lot easier when you've reached higher levels. I'm level 23 and facing opponents of similar level and finding that I can cut them down no problem. Fine, I may have got used to the controls but I found it much more challenging at the start of the game whilst still on Kephallonia. Regardless, combat is fun and the abilities you can unlock extremely satisfying to use (Spartan Kick being, of course, my favourite and probably the most famous one in the game.)

The mercenaries system is also very good - you can move up tiers as you defeat other mercenaries who roam about the world as you do. All are unique, reminding me very much of Shadow of Mordor where all the Orc Warlords you could face were different every time. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, some have animal companions that help them fight, and defeating them usually lands you some decent gear, particularly parts of legendary sets which offer you massive bonuses when you wear the entire set.

All in all, I am very impressed with this game and can see myself playing it for 100+ hours. I will definitely be purchasing the Season Pass when it comes on sale again as I have heard good things about the expansions. Well done Ubisoft for releasing a very, very good Assassin's Creed game - possibly my favourite since ACII!

This is a very well executed continuation of the series, with additional stuff copied from all other cool games. It kinda feels like a hybrid of Witcher 3, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor (abilities + mercenaries system) and previous ACs. Overall, nothing new or original but very solid and entertaining game with good amount of content.

Some quick comments:
-The environment is fantastic - this can be the sole reason to play the game! You walk in the ancient Athens etc - awesome (as good as in Witcher 3);

-Playing on "hard" is challenging enough to use my brain, until I get most of my abilities.
My point: you can customise the game and fights you have as challenging as you want to by simply not picking too strong abilities.
Therefore, I purposely opted out from "bazooka/machine-bow" hunter tree abilities to increase the assassin feeling. I also tend to leave out all AoE stuns and explosions (even in combat tree) as they tend to be just a combat deux ex machinas ruining all the fun.

-Characters and story - well... it is a combat driven game with RPG addons, so as usual - "meh" or just ok; Quests are not challenging and conversation options often surprisingly not in line with what I thought I was choosing. Also, my choices do not seem to have big impact on the story. It is a poor illusion of choice. The challenge comes mostly from fights (mechanics) with "bosses" (e.g. epic beasts, mercenaries or cult members);

-Get used to throwing away legendary equipment due to fast leveling - feels like leveling up a character from WoW, just leave everything behind after playing with it for 5 minutes as it is too expensive (laborious) to keep upgrading it;

-Horse riding sucks and I prefer to run;

-There are battles: they are fun to play BUT they remind more gladiator fights than the actual Greek battles (no formations, to phalanx, no tactic, just "Black Flag ships boarding" fight);

- Naval battles - very similar to what was in the Black Flag, although it is hilarious to see how those triremes speed and navigate like motorboats...

Ive loved Assassins Creed franchise from the very first game. Almost obseesively so. But even a fanboy like me couldnt deny the series was getting stale by the time Syndicate came around. It was a good game, but it was more of the same one too many times.

I wholeheartedly feel the shift of Origins to a more RPG-ish game and the eventual release of Odyssey as a full blown RPG was exactly what the series needed.

They've done so much right with this game. The gameplay is top notch. Exploration is fun as all hell. Combat (which has always been a weak point of the series till origins) is now even better, and for a change they put some focus on modern day story and first civilisation story. Its no Ezio trilogy in the lore department, but its not like the games after AC3 where modern day/first civilisation lore was all but abandoned.

Suffice to say, this game was a dream come true.

If i had to complain about one thing, it'd be that the game is too big for its own good. If a couple islands and some area like phokis/lokris didnt exist, it wouldnt take anything away from the game, and infact would make the game look NOT bloated. Bigger isnt always better. And im not saying make a small map and pack it better. The packing of stuff to do is PERFECT. Just making it smaller will mean less forts (so every fort you clear has more meaning) and less caves (again, since caves arent a dime a dozen every cave you clear makes you feel accomplished), you can only feel good about cleaning some fort or cave or camp so many times before the diminishing returns begin to creep in.

apart from this small thing. I love this game and would recommend it to everyone i know.

I'm Greek.
I've never seen anything like this game.
I never expected anything like it.
Simply put, it's the most culturally respectful game I've ever seen.
Better than any game, movie, or other media.
The only things that come close are books (Mary Renault's Bull From the Sea for example) But even those can't match the complexity, the breadth, the research...
I'm totally blown away.
It's so cool!

I grew up watching media that disrespected my people's history in pointless, stupid ways.
Movies so whitewashed... Forget Greek leads, they wouldn't even use Greek extras!
They'd get the stories wrong, miss all the good stuff, and generally ruin everything.
I never dared dream that something like this game could exist.
They absolutely nailed it.

I've been many of the places in this game.
They captured the soul of these places, they made them live and breath, they brought them to life.
The loving detail, the craftsmanship, the familiarity with the myths and history...
It's too much for words.
It's indescribable.
Magical.
Sublime.
They even used Greek voice actors!
They recreated sea shanties and work songs using homeric hyms and fragmentary evidence.

Of course, it's a fun game too.
They knocked that out of the park as well.

I love it.
It's everything I ever wished for as child and so much more.
There are no words.
Just buy it.
They deserve it.
You won't regret it.
I wish I could thank every person who made this game personally.
That still wouldn't be enough.

Pretty late to review this game but i can say without a doubt this game deserves all the credit it is getting, no matter if its not on sale 100% worth the asking price.
What separates this AC game from the others is many things that can be listed, for example just how in depth the game developers are with Greek culture and how it is shown throughout the expansive world no matter where you end up you will always encounter an area rich in historical and mythological writings this makes a AC fan like myself praise what this game has been made into.
With the whole atmosphere and graphical stand point there isnt really much to critique, even at a lower graphical setting it can be such a beautiful game. Then when it comes to the combat system which everyone focuses on i can say it is a smooth flowing system that doesnt impact the enjoyment of this whole game.
One issue i can say without being too biased is you will most likely face a bug, the one i faced was that my character was stuck looking in a specific direction but its nothing that a restart cant help.
OVERALL 9.2/10

Long story, short: The game is awesome. It deserve its full price. I can compare this game with The Witcher 3 (but in Greece). One amazing RPG. If you are RPG fan. Take it, you won't regret. If you are casual gamer, who like to play only mobas and games which end in 30 minute without character development and any world exploring, this game for sure is not for you.

Performance is great. I have a relatively decent pc and it just worked perfectly on ultra settings. No crashes, during my playtime.

I love it. Love the gameplay, graphics, story. Yes, there are bugs as usual but they're not that bad. I just don't like how easily they swapped Kass' and Alexios' roles with no unique storyline. That was a huge letdown for me. Guess I've put in a lot of hope on Ubisoft.

Actually the only AC game I played from the series. I love ancient Greece, that was my main reason buying the game.
Game is fun. Here is what I like:

+. I enjoyed how free we are allowed to roam around ignoring the main storyline. Imagine playing GTA but it's ancient Greece.

+. Also like the fact that armors and weapons' appearance can be replaced with any 'skin' we've found in the game without spending any resource, you might know the term 'transmog'.

+. Ability reset also feels quite cheap through the mid-late game, so no worries if you feel like you have taken bad decision on investing ability points.

+. The landscape, the view from the mountains, the open lands, the sea, the night sky. My lord, they are so beautiful on my GTX1060.

+. Photograph mode, really. I took lots of nice pics and wasted lots of time distracted by this feature.

+. Two main characters to choose from, this might seem trivial but it's a great bonus to me who likes strong female warrior! or assassin!

+. Many more.

If you see this game on sale and you like ancient Greece. Get it.

If you don't mind playing a refurbished AC: Origins mechanics, then this game is for you. The gameplay is almost identical to that of AC: Origins, meaning it's more RPG and Witcher 3 rip off than an AC game as we knew them before Origins. So, past this dillema, we are left with an absolutely amazing setting set in Ancient Greece during the Peloponese War, aka 490BC. Since in Origins we witnessed the birth of the Assassin Order, in this game, since it's already a couple of centuries before those events, we have some sort of prequel to the birth of either the templar order and the assassins. Becuase of that it doesn't feel very Assassin's Creed. Enough said about that, get the game if you want to know more.

Now... as for the graphics and the world, it's amazing and the pictures don't do it enough credit. You have to play to actually understand how awesome it is. You get to travel to various parts of Ancient Greece, including lots of islands. I myself have visited several of those places, actually the majority and the experience was even better. I could navigate around the world without using the map most of the time due to my knowledge of the geography lol.

You also get to sail with a Trireme kind of ship equiped with bows, javelins and fire. Quite great sea battles but not as good as Black Flag's.

Something that would require the attention of the design team, especially those in charge of the Ancient Greek, is the words "pater" and "mater". People, these two words are latin, the actual Ancient Greek are "πατὴρ (patir)" and "μήτηρ (mitir)". It felt a bit out of place hearing them. I won't comment on the history misinformation since this is a fantasy game and it has the appropriate warning in the beginning. Enjoyable nevertheless.

Last, but not least, you get to fight actual mythical monsters!! Hell yeah (see? more fantasy than a typical AC game)!

Oh and it's quite huge; actually the biggest map in a game ever. However the map could use a bit more attention from the team, for example the island of Delos... is actually really tiny compared to Mykonos :)

After playing this game for more than 200+ hours I decided to write a review. The game itself is great with amazing graphics. The ancient Greece very much amazed me by its beauty and the underworlds which are included in the dlc are amazing.
The only problem with this game is that it was created by Ubisoft. What can we expect from Ubisoft. The game is poorly optimised. If you have a intel i5 or below i.e. 4core 4thread processor forget that this game will give 60fps @1080p. I used an i5 7400 with Gtx980ti (beast at its time) can't even get me constant 60fps.
The main story of the game is ridiculous, seriously I would have played tomb raider if I knew how boring it would be. There are tons of repitive side quests which you have to complete to increase your in game level. Thanks to Ubisoft who keeps on increasing the level cap after every update to sell their in game Helix. There are minor bugs in the game which were never fixed nor I am expecting them to be fixed beacouse developers are only interested in making money by adding new gear packs which are only purchasable by our money.
The only thing which I liked about this game was the Dlc i.e. The fate of atlantis, Ubisoft did a great job there by adding new worlds which are as beautiful as ancient Greece. I don't know about the atlantis as it has not yet been released in the market. Its about to be an year since the game has launched and not all dlc's have been delivered. I mean seriously when you take the whole payment in advance and then take a whole year to release a dlc wow. Good job ubisoft.
The episodes are released every 6 weeks prior to the other which is a very long time. As each episode is not more than 6-7 hours. Personally speaking it took me about 10-12 hours with all cutscenes. Still waiting for the last episode and after that I ll sure be uninstalling your game from my device.
In the end I would like to say buying this game at full price is not a good idea and do buy the season pass so that you receive all the dlc's since main story is not that interesting.

This is easily the best Assassin's Creed game to date. I love everything that they did with it. I love that some of your choices make a difference in the world, I love that you encounter and fight creatures from Greek Myth, I love that there was a little bit of a romance system going (I wish there was more to it though), I love that you could choose between two characters/genders (and unlike Syndicate, there wasn't any difference gameplay/skill wise). The controls felt much more smooth than previous Assassin's Creed games / less awkward. I also really loved all the quests with Sokrates! I'm glad that he had a fairly large role in the game.

I enjoyed the story line for the most part (meeting Alexios's/Kassandra's father felt out of place but I totally get why it was there and why it needed to be there). I will admit that I got a little confused early on with the war - I didn't understand which side I was fighting for, only to discover that I wasn't on any side... you kill them both. Which confused me even more. So I ended up ignoring most of those "kill athenians / kill spartans" quests. One thing I liked about it though, is that you can do as many or as little of those quests as you want - the war, and mercenary stuff is by no means required; If you want to do it, it will help you out.. if you don't want to do it, you will still be just fine.

I was honestly very unsure when I bought this game because i'm not very interested in Greek Mythology or culture, I thought that might end up ruining it for me/being boring... but here it is as my new favorite, and I definitely see myself replaying this game in the future multiple times over.

Now please give us Assassin's Creed Vikings in this same style.

Better than Blackflag, seriously just pulled an 8 day marathon, 101 hr
It did crash 5 times in this time but thats not too bad. Very polished in my opinion, i was running max settings with 7700k and 1080ti on 3440x1440p and kept the frames around 60hz. There was some stutter but it was minimal, seriously don't know what to do with my like now........malaka

After over 40+ hours in the game so far I can easily say that I'm impressed. I had lost hope/ interest in AC after 3 (all my AC games were on console thats when I switched to PC) and I had not purchased nor played AC since then. After only watching a mere 30 minute video of the intro area I decided to give this game a try. I love the fact that they are integrating a more 'RPG' feel to the game as your character makes choices. This allows you to drive the story in the way that fits you or how you want it to be.
I have 40+ hours in game and I'm only level 25. I have been taking my time exploring and taking in the amazing landscape the game provides. The combat system was a bit odd to get used to from the classic AC games (AGAIN I came from playing AC on xbox) but from what I understand it is very similar to origins.
- I will update as I go on with the story and have a full review when the game is complete
So far 10/10

Excellent game. A breath of fresh air for the Assassins Creed series. Contains a well executed gear upgrading system, that, regardless of what a large portion of the reviews say, is not pay to win. You can see how many hours I've put into this game, and at no point did it feel like a grind. I've genuinely enjoyed almost every moment of this game. The map is massive and all layers on combat, seafaring, combat, stealth, and ranged feel like independen systems that come together very well. In all honesty, this is my favorite Assassins Creed game since Brotherhood.

That's not to say it is without flaws. It's a very demanding game, I suffer from occasional studdering issues when first launching the game. I have had the occasional marker from a completed objective lingering around, and god forbid you tab out.

First time I am going to write a review on steam.
The Good:
I absolutely loved this game. I like the changes they have made from previous AC games.
Characters are really fleshed out and memorable.
I played as Kassandra and she is a badass.
Some people said progression is slow and so on, for me it was perfect becuase you actually care about your weapons and gear unlike some other games. I loved hunting all the beasts to get the artemis gear.
Story of the game makes you go through all sorts of emotions.
I Really cared for the characters in game.

The Bad:
there are some bugs where your character gets stuck on a ledge or something and you cant do anything. You will have to do the mission again.
Some side quests are really boring. Specially the fetch stuff ones. I have completed the main story but there are many side quests still left.
Tamed beasts dont come with you on the ship. So that ability is basically useless.

Overall 9/10

Figured that after sinking 100+ hours into this game and completing the Odyssey storyline, hunting down the entire Cult of Kosmos and before starting the DLC, it was time for me to write a review.

As a massive fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise, I was sceptical about this game, as I previously was with Origins. The move away from the default game and moving towards an RPG based game was not what I expected, but I'm glad they did. The storyline is strong, being able to play as both Alexios and Kassandra allows you to make difficult choices that heavily impact the ending(s) of the game.

Your Odyssey

The story places you as being a Misthios of Kephallonia, with the main goal of reuniting his/her family. There are multiple main storylines that you can pursue throughout the game, one being your Odyssey, and the other to hunt all of the Cult of Kosmos members - those who split your family apart.

Pros

Over a good 80 hours of gameplay - including the main storyline along with many sidequests to get distracted by.
Graphics are amazing - Photo Mode allows for some stunning photos to be taken.
Unlike some previous games in the series, game easily runs at 60fps with smooth gameplay.
Naval Battles - one of the many things I loved about Black Flag was being able to engage in smooth naval battles, being able to customise your ship throughout the game, and this game adds to the love of being able to island hop, engage in many naval battles, and just sail the seas to your heart's content.
Being able to call your ship no matter the Dock can be massively useful, if you've been off exploring an island or city.

Cons

One problem, which is the same I faced in Origins, that the wait time after Fast Travelling can take ages, whist either being left on the hint screen, or just the entire screen being blank.
Sometimes, the voice acting can just seem to drag, especially with the side quests where it seems like some characters have been talking for ages. This isn't really a massive problem as it usually explains where certain quest items are which is always a positive.

Season Pass

Considering I never usually purchase a Season Pass, I was surprised when Odyssey's ended up in my basket. I enjoyed this game so much, I didn't want to stop playing.
The Season Pass is going to include two DLC stories, spanning a total of six episodes, as well as including remastered editions of both Assassin's Creed III and Liberation, so for the price tag, is definitely worth it.

Overall, highly recommend this game to anyone who is either a fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise, or anyone interested in a good RPG.

If you liked Origins, then you will love Odyssey. It takes everything great about Origins and does a lot more of that. The main character also has a lot more personality than the protagonist of Origins so if you are into story, then this one should scratch that itch of yours. Only problems I can think of are some minor bugs here and there, as well as the game not running quite as good as I would like, although it is an improvement over Origins in that regard. Overall, this is a very good game and maybe my favorite Assassin's Creed since Black Flag.

This has to be one of the best AC games yet! I’ve played all 11 games with the series and I haven’t had more fun with any like Odyssey. Now on my 5th time playing it with DLC now included having a different experience everytime is what makes this art magnificent! Well done Ubisoft.

Yes, they continue to change the unique gameplay of Assassin's creed by turning it into a more mainstream and even somewhat traditional RPG experience..

Ubisoft can't go wrong with their Assassin's Creed franchise. I am happy that they haven't stopped this journey which started in 2007. I only hope that Ubisoft keeps us engaged with new and better titles from the franchise. About the game, well, there's nothing much to tell. Those who have played it, know how good it is. And the happiness is undescribable. Me, I have got no words to describe how good it was. I thought Assassin's Creed Origins was going to be the last. I am totally satisfied and really happy that I bought Assassin's Creed Odyssey. I love the RPG-ish style of a game which Ubisoft has introduced. The game has given the player total freedon the way the player wants to advance in the game. And the game is unending. There's already so much to do after completing the main story. The story was absolutely fantastic. I have played all Assassin's Creed game, and the thing which makes me so happy is the story that they put. Ubisoft has never disappointed me with the story. I wish the story continued. I didn't want it to end. :(

Assassin's Creed will not and never should die. The only thing I missed was a Hidden Blade. Good that they came up with Spear of Leonidas which could atleast Assassinate enemies, XD. Graphics-I don't need to talk about it, do I? Gameplay-99% perfect, best so far I have seen and better than Origins. The dialogue chosing options seemed a bit like Witcher series, but its okay, 'You've gotta make a start someday'.

The other think that I liked, and which made me buy this game so fast, was its pricing. No offence Ubisoft, but I loved the price you kept for Odyssey.

So far, in one word I would love to describe this game as - Fabulantastic

the more i played this game, the more i realised just how empty the open world is, and how heartless the characters feel. Every NPC has a forgettable face and every quest is just a fruitless box-ticking exercise. Characters are not memorable and feel copy and pasted into the copy and pasted cities. The only unique - feeling city is Athens, and even that, being the largest city in the game, what should be a bustling hub of life feels dead and empty
You can trod for ages i the open world and find nothing but repetitive caves and outposts, where you can find about 5 variations of damage sponges, or "guards" as the game refers to them
RPG mechanics are misused, and leveling up feels like a constant grind to nowhere. Not being able to assassinate a simple guard who is the same level as me in one hit is a ridiculous flaw in the gameplay mechanics
Dialogue options are ultimately meaningless and just an attempt to be like The Witcher 3. Your actions have no effect on the game world or characters, both of which suffer from a significant lack of depth. As mentioned before, the game world feels 2 dimentional, and characters are without soul. This could be from the lack of chatter in cities, simplistic animation routines or the limited diversity in character models.
The superpowers are a pisstake on the first civilisation aspects of the franchise's lore, and reguardless of your character's demigod status, enemies are still damage sponges. This, on top of the lacking open world and characters completely destroys and hope of immersion.
On the plus side, the game's engine provides stunning visuals and the landscape / environment team did a fantastic job recreating ancient Greece in its entirety, even if the content within it is severely lacking depth.
Kassandra / Alexios's running animation feels sort of stiff and rigid, further deducting from immersion
It was clear from the beginning that this would fail to be a good assassin's creed game, with it being set roughly 400 years before the founding of the Brotherhood, but unfortunately this game fails to be a good RPG game as well.
Don't get me started on the DLC.

So if you took Assassins Creed origins, added in a bit of Witcher 3 style questing and conversation (although the writing is not on a par with TW 3 in fairness) and then lifted the nemisis system from Shadows of War you have Odyssey.

It is not without its flaws, some of the voice acting is dicey at best especially on the side quests you can practically tell your character is pulling from a bag of stock phrases, and and the default controls are still janky and need a lot of tweaking.

But it is a lot of fun and really nice to explore the world.

Though the microtransactions are shady AF (the XP boost feels almost mandatory if you dont want to grind out a tonne of kill 20 of this quests)

I would still recommend it.

Amazing overall game really enjoyed the RPG aspects that they added in with this one, it was a much needed refresher of an overmilked genre. Despite the positive changes you can still see the inner ubisoft of the game as there is a variety of cosmetics and also in game boosters for your character can be purchased with microtransactions. I see many people saying that the game is grindy and forces you almost to spend money however I didn't experience this. The games style definetly forces you to do side missions and explore so if you are someone who just wants to beat the main story and be done maybe this isn't the game for you.

How can i say it? It's the most perfect version of AC. Imagine everything that you ever played in other AC games, and put it together, plus with a rpg content, envyroment, a HUGE ( yeah, its HUGE ) world to explore and travel, breathtaking landscapes and views.. You almost are experiencing de Classic Greece like you are there. As a fan of history like myself, this game never stop to amaze me. Trust me guys, you NEED to buy this game! I can go straight foward and buy the deluxe edition, the game has a lot of huge updates and free content, it's remarkable, it's awesome, of course this is a ubisoft product so there are bugs, it's not perfect but you are paying the right price for this, i can tell myself that you are receiving a lot more that you are paying for.

9.3/10 - Just buy it and be happy!

EDIT: After spending almost 100 hours in Odyssey and then moving on to Valhalla, I CAN NOT in clear conscience recommend Odyssey. If you care about Assassin's Creed as a franchise & are a veteran fan, please don't buy or play this game. Move on to Valhalla, play Origins, or literally any other game in the franchise.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey has nothing to do with the Assassin's Creed, except sharing the name. It does include a lot of Isu (precursor civilization) story, but it goes more towards fantasy rather than Sci-Fi.


The continued support for the game post launch has certainly improved the game, and has done away with almost all the problems it had at launch, which I get to towards the end of my original review.

Recommended much more now. My original review follows.

This Game is such a fantastic game.
Micro Transactions do not belong in this game but it does not ever tell me to buy anything. I have my XP Boost that comes for free, not sure if its the Ultimate edition perk but I havent used it and as much fun as the game is to me I don't ever feel like the grind is a chore. I enjoy the grind and killing enemys and powering up.

I love the Power perks you earn and each perk has about 3 tiers and its awesome to level up and use them. Makes you feel like a bad ass.

The only downside to me is that the game optimization is bad.

I am running at high and it looks great, Ultra High still runs great but it stutters bad from time to time.
Running the game on High or very high you can't really see the difference unless you are very picky with graphic settings.

Do I recommend this game. ♥♥♥♥ Yes I do. You also forget you are playing a Assassins Creed game and the whole animus crap is very short coming so it rarely comes into play. I would play more of this game but I work and have kids and have a lot of other games I play since Broketober came along.

Overall this game is my game of the year action adventure with RPG Elements. Also, a lot of the side quest are freaking hilarious and dam do the greeks ♥♥♥♥ a lot in them times. I tried to Flirt with some woman after calling her a liar in some quest I was doing and when she got pissed at me I asked to sleep with her and she shot me down because I asked her that after calling her out. She did however join my crew at Sea.

Great game. I love that the last 2 games have let the Animus take a back seat. I always hated that part of the AC series. This game is fun to explore and combat is much improved. To be honest i think Origins was just a bit better but both are good games. Ubi lets take this new Assassin's creed to Japan or China

So far a really big fan of the new RPG direction that they are taking the series in.
Pros
Good graphics
Amazing story
Combat is satisfying and engaging
Black flag like navel combat returns but sadly no cannons
tons of content some of it meh and other parts of it amazing but you will get your moneys worth out of this game.

Cons
Microtransactions
DRM
Poor PC optimization
Game can feel like a grind* but for me personally I enjoyed the side content and the game only started to feel grindy once I got to around level 43 out of the 50 levels.

I love this game, but Ubisoft's utterly baffling decision to destroy player agency in the latest DLC does not deserve to be supported. I, and many others, bought this game largely because one of its selling points was the fact that you could play an LGBT+ character in a market that is starved for LGBT+ representation. I won't go into details here, but suffice it to say, the game's second DLC strips out that aspect in its entirety. Your character's sexuality is forced out of your hands. It's difficult to describe how betrayed I feel, but given this is an Ubisoft game, I'm not sure what I expected.

Ill expand upon this when I compelte the game. I Highly reccomend this game to not just fgans of previous assassins creed games but to anyone that enjoys RPGs! All the negative reviews complaining about the game being to grindy because of microtransactions have no idea what they are talking about. The game is not grindy at all. Yes, there are microtransactions, but you never need to purchase a single one to enjoy the game!

My only issues with this game are the lack of fast travel options to cities in this game. You are restricted to the viewpoints and your ship. I also find it odd that you fight in a time period where a shield was a major part of the military attire, yet you are without one.

Love it so far. Very happy with the direction UBI are taking the franchise.

Performance is pretty bad if you're trying to run on Very High/Ultra High. To be honest there really is no need.

With some tweaking and a mixture of Medium/High/Very High (Volumetric clouds on medium) I get 55-90fps (55 being the minimum) at 3440x1440 (100hz G-Sync) with a 1080ti. It looks stunning.

Certain settings such as Character Detail and Environment Detail and even AO and AA (at higher resolutions) have very little visual different from Very High - Ultra High or High - Very High but have a significant performance hit... especially to your minimum FPS.

Volumetric clouds also have a major impact on FPS.

Dropping clouds to Medium, Character and Environment to Very High and Shadows to High took my minimum FPS from sub 30 to 55, increased my maximum a little and my average was 70ish FPS.

Comparing Screenshots at these settings to all out Ultra showed very little difference. Certainly not enough to worry about.

Don't listen to the negative reviews, about half of them are complaining about microtransactions that only are 100% optional that have no effect on the gameplay. This is a great game, but expect Origins 2.0 because this is roughly what that is.

Double the size of Origins and add ship combat from Black Flag and don't forget to sprinkle in some lite Nemesis system from Shadows of Mordor.

At first i hated ubi for releasing 2 AC's within 1 year of eachother.

But o boii was i wrong. Everything they could do better in Origins they did in Odyssey
This RPG style AC route Ubi is taking with the series is AWESOME!
Cant stop playing this game <3

So far im sucked into the story! They did an amazing job with this game. I didnt like origins to much. I felt the combat was clunky but they definitely built off of what they did in origins and made it so much better. Also the decision making that changed the narrative of the story was a nice touch. Keep it up UBISOFT!!

I haven't gotten too far into the story, and I'm only level 17 or so, but in such a short amount of time AC Odyssey has easily become one of my favourite games. Most RPG's I play, like skyrim or TW3, I enjoy the exploration and side quests/activities for a short while and then get bored and just follow the main quests. In most other games, I skip dialogue because I'm too impatient. In AC Odyssey, I find myself exploring every nook and cranny, listening to the dialogue, taking on every mission and contract I can because I want to experience it all. I love how the story is unfolding so far, and I really do like the ability to fight for either faction or both. Really fun combat (Best combat in the entire series IMO), stealth works the same as in the older games, ship battles have never been faster or smoother, and the story is superb. Honestly haven't found anything to dislike! I love this game. Also, you can ride a super macho sparkly unicorn into battle.

This game is H U G E !!!!



Finished the main quest, still have 50++ unfinished side quest, and omg.. theres lot more quest to discover.

================= Update full DLC release review : ==========

Don't forget to visit Atlantis !! a Masterpiece of map design. (the designer team totally push their imagination for this DLC). Worth every penny.

========================= Overall =====================

What makes this games (for me) "not quite good" is :

1. You can use some "upgraded overpower" skills which is not bad for some people, but for me ? um, no thanks i prefer "traditional//ordinary//common" skill without magic imbued.
2. if you play AC: Syndicate you'll have many combat finisher right ?, but, Odyssey doesn't have that fancy move. so..

3. NO GLITCH ! What !?, The AC series i know they have.. Always have glitch issue but in Odyssey. haha, i miss AC glitch. <-----= (this is positive).

so,, with 250 Hours i'd to say this Game is Recommended 8.5/10

Someone needs to give the guy who named the missions a raise.

Listen, you can run around and climb anything, sail the seas and be a mother******* SPARTAN!!

The setting is one of the best Assassin's Creed has ever been to, my only issue is that I could do without the magic and all. Take it back to an AC 2 feel where you are just a badass human who uses his superior skills, and assassinations should always be a one shot kill.

It does get old fast however, and the story isn't as strong as past ones that really pulled us in.

It' is still worth it, but do not expect to be playing it for years.

(First Impressions review.. will update later)
I would say that AC is now very close to regaining its long lost crown after the AC 2.. This game as many of u have heard is MASSIVE.. am abt 50 hrs in and I have only done abt 10% of the game.. Which doesnt mean that the game is too grindy.. I'd say that it will feel lyk it only if u r a type of person who'd jump from main quest to main quest w/o bothering abt anything this game has to offer.. In my 50 hrs I have never felt the need to increase my lvl through grind jst to catch up with the main quest as I was doin every side quest (some of which are in a way related to main quests) and felt that leveling works more organically..

A huge improvement in the side content department.. They have interesting stories, characters and on top of that player choices adds a bit more fun to reel you in.. Other than the side quests per se there are other side contents that plays in tandem such as the mercenary system (an updated form of the Phylakitais in Origins) feels reminiscent of the Nemesis system in Shadow of war.. They show up in strange places at tyms where u dnt xpect for eg in Conquest battles (another side content) that makes the player on their toes whenever they are hunting u.. U can choose to hunt them as well for high lvl gear.. There are other interesting features (one of the best really) which I dont want to spoil.. A quick note : use exploration mode and u will thank me..

I felt lyk the whole Conquest system feels pointless.. U jst do it to gain rewards but it doesnt really change anything as u can repeat the whole battle over and over again in a region.. The battle itself feels shallow.. After one or two battles it might get a bit boring.. I chose to avoid it if I can..

Combat is more fast paced than Origins.. The whole abilities system would make way to create builds.. Parry and dodge or easier and they are essential.. No more button smashing.. The abilities add an interesting layer to keep every enemy encounter unique.. Nothing is more satisfying than kicking high lvl enemies off the cliff and watch them utter their last growl.. Varied enemy types including beasts require different strategy to effectively finish them off.. Legendary beasts and ships are a treat..

Naval battle is reminiscent of black flag although not as fun as black flag.. The ship controls feels a bit sturdy than the Jackdaw.. Other than that its still the same.. They could have included some junk loots on ships which we could have sold via message board as it was in black flag.. Customisation is limited.. But the lieutenant feature makes up for it..

Roundup
Pros:
Graphics
Story
Characters
Choices (and their impacts)
Side contents (especially the one which I cant spoil)
Exploration
Combat
Naval

Cons:
FPS drops in certain cities like Athens (regains after a few minutes)
Conquest systems are a bit shallow, repetitive and has no impact
In a big rpg world full of characters there is no ingame Glossary/Database
Microtransactions (avoidable but have to mention it)
The new loot box merchant is worse than the Heka chest system
Weird walking animation for Kassandra

As a season pass owner and having early access to the game , a 5 hour exploration and mission on an island before the main introduction starts <3 , oddysey has to be one of the most promising title of Ubisoft in the assassins creed series <3 a must buy be it sale or not
its well optimised ..... playing on i3 2nd gen and 750ti with 50 FPS , not bad i say <3.

Origin + Blackflag = Odessey. Insanely huge world map. True seemless open world unlike witcher 3 broken up into 3 big zones. No loading screen except initial loading of save game. Seemless land to water and vice versa add nicely to immersion.

Naval battle is fun and upgrades for your ship and crew a nice touch. Recriting sailor that join you while doing random mission are nice suprises.

Combat feels slightly better and tighter and less floaty than origin. More fun skills added and combat sounds good. Ok music only.

Performance on par with origin. Story pretty interesting and sides mission, interestingly enough so far less varied than origin. Recommended play style is at least on Hard with exploration mode and light hud settings for real immersion. After few hours you wont miss those annoying quest marker and will have to explore or rely on npcs for whereabouts of mission location. Your eagle becomes more than just a tool marking enemies when played in this mode. Dont hesitate if you liked origin. Getting more of the same and more.

I have played assassins creed odyssey for about 300 hours. I've completed every single achievement and reached level 99 (which is max) then went beyond gaining extra 10 mastery levels essentially meaning level 109. The size of this game is crazy, and the DLCs are totally worth it. The few bugs you may encounter on the way aren't even that annoying, and will definitely not stop you from completing all of the achievements. If you're looking for an open world game where you can throw in a few hundred hours of exploration, this is the game for you.

Pros:
-Vast and detailed open-world. It's huge.
-Beautiful graphics and environments.
-Story that starts out simple, but gets really good later on.
-In-depth RPG elements to build your character and control their stats.
-Interesting and engaging combat that never gets stale, and allows many different play styles.
-Ship to ship combat as good as Blag Flag.
-A progression system that makes it so you always have multiple tasks at hand.
-Dialogue choices will affect the world and characters.

Cons (minor things):
-Voice acting is meh. Probably because there is an absurd amount of dialogue in this game.
-While to world is very authentic to ancient Greece, the story has some fantastical/sci-fi elements that some people may find breaks the immersion.
-PC optimization could be better
-On nightmare difficulty enemies sometimes feel like damage sponges,
-The prices of ship upgrades are a bit much
-Microtransactions. Not necessary at all, but they try to take advantage of people with limited time to play with their "time savers." e.g. xp-boosts, materials, money, and collectible maps.
___
Some people say this game gets a little grindy, but if you do the side quests and take advantage of message boards, leveling up should not really be a problem. You won't be able to get away with just doing the main story quests, you have to engage with the world a little.
This game is not very "Assassin's Creed like," so all you diehard fans might not feel right at home. Rushing into a crowd and swinging your sword has been made just as viable as quiet stealth strategy.
The story is technically tied to Assassins vs Templars lore, but not by much.

More of the same as Origins. An open world grind and lack of an interesting story. Open combat is once again the main feature as stealth is a joke. No variation in animations and parkour once again is meh.

Update 4/11/2018 - This is the best Singleplayer game I've played since The Witcher 3 and I only spent 35 hours in that.. 120+ hours in this game now and still loving it. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great game to fill their time :D

As a gamer who 99% of the time plays Multiplayer games only, this has really surprised me and I absolutely love it. 10/10 would ditch all my online buddies to play alone again.

First off the game looks and feels great at first you will have also a lot of fun.
But it gets rather dull really fast. after the first island you will notice it that you can't assanate some of the characters.
it will just do a ton of damage, after they will call their friends and bye bye stealth aproach.
The game also has a leveling system in place, but I soon realised that it's completley pointless, just to make sure you don't
go to the higher level places first. if you level to high for a reagon the enemies will level with you.
Theses things all combined made this for me a naggitive expierence.

The story is okay and I like the fact you can play as both male or female. and they are fully voice acted.
I did not like the mordren world parts, in all honesty I wish they had removed that all. it's boring and not fun to play.
I am not 100% sure about the choices they feel more like to change up the dialog but not the story that much.
From what I have seen so far.

This game also has optional Microtransactions, they are not a must yet but I wonder... Just don't support that kind of thing,

Overall I think this game might be a fun game to play if you can get over the negitives.
But not at full price. buy it on sale is my advice. or atleast wait for more reviews.

Edit 19-01-2019

So I decided to give this game another chance, and here are my findings play for 5-10 minutes crash. this is what I encountered over and over again. so I put all settings on low. and locked fps to 30 max. It helped a little but still crashes around 30mins to an hour. sometimes longer...

This game has a heavy load on your memory cpu, and if you are on an older pc you will not be able to play this game anymore, as this game is growing bigger and bigger with the expansions of the season pass. it will get to hard to handle.

Also the latest patch added level scaling options. when I saw it at first I was happy but as soon as I look on my smile turned upsidedown, it was a slap in the face after all we asked to turn level scaling off, and they constatly said its on the roadmap. and when it was finally there. it was not what we asked for. now you have 3 options
You can leave enemies as the same level as you on any difculty
or 2 levels belore or 4 levels below and that is it max 4 levels below.

All I can say I am disapointed in Ubisoft and advice all of you never to preorder a game from them wait for official reviews on youtube to tell you all about the game.
And then decide if you want to buy it yes or no.

Goods:
- Beautifully realised and nice looking mediterranean landscape.
- Big map thus a lot of exploration.
- Interesting plot.

Bads:
- Not a big fan of the combat system.
- Very heavy. Stresses even powerful systems.
- Constant stereotypical usage of greek words like 'mal@k@s' which makes the game extremely cringey at times (source: I'm greek).

Great game, tho.

This is a truly giant open-world game filled with a plethora of interesting stories, a captivating Ancient Greek setting, and beautiful landscapes. Though the game has its occasionally annoying features, such as a messy inventory system, it would be hard to argue that this massive game is not overall worthy of a recommendation. The game allows for a variety of play-styles, plot choices, and difficulties, making it easy for any gamer to find the approach they seek. Whether you want to casually explore the Greek world and learn about its history and mythology, challenge yourself with stealthy assassination missions, or indulge your blood-lust as you cut down warriors, Odyssey will provide the experience you seek.

For anyone considering buying it, I would highly recommend purchasing the Gold Edition on sale because the additional story content does provide many new experiences and the Fate of Atlantis DLC includes three amazing new areas. The DLC packs are also required to unlock all of the achievements.

PS: I did not experience any significant bugs, but achievement hunters might want to check online sources for obscure completion requirements. Also, anyone who has played Assassin's Creed: Origins will notice improvements to many of the game mechanics in Odyssey. I will note that the archery in this game seems to have been simplified; the player can only use one standard bow and slightly modify it with special engravings and arrows. Lots of the previous class-unique behaviors of bows have been implemented as obtainable abilities.

This was money well spent. Best immersive world experience I have had since Witcher 3. I loved Withcer 3. I am a bit of an rpg and exploration die hard and it seems the AC games are slowly evolving that way.

The dialogues are usually well put together. Character voices and acting are mostly great. (One exception are spartan commanders for battles, they sound like try hard bad boys)

The quests are mostly endearing, thoguh I have not quite seen twists and such to W3 levels.

The scenery is amazing, the detail is second to none. I once sat and watched three characters go through an entire religious ritual to a god, without my involvement and all. Characters laugh, sleep, joke, dance fight and so on, all around you.

The cities do start to blur, but that is very finelining. Most of them feel unique and have a true character to them.

I enjoy the combat, though as the game goes on it leaves historical and moves into mythical (I have no problem with that, but some may).

Travel is great, horse, ship, swimming and feet. There are less things to climb other than some impressive temples, but that seems less of an issue, except when you really like death from above.

Mercenaries and cultists are a great add.

There are relatively few bugs, but they do pop up now and then (I once had to take on the entire Athenian navy myself and thoght it was silly, but on a reload my Spartan allies actually joined the battle)

I have enjoyed the direction the franchise has been going. I thought it was a bit weird at first to set this 400 years before Origins, but then I realised that they do not actually mention Assassins or Templars within the Greek world parts of the game and it made a bit more sense.

Though there are a lot of well thought out missions, it could do with a bit more diversity in general pick up mission types, and I could probably do without the over the top sexual advances from a few characters. Not that I mind sex in games, but a bit of seduction or hints rather than straight up proposals clumsily thrown at me would be nice.

All in all I highly recommend.

Didn't buy Origins since I was really tired of the Assassins Creed formula of endless follow missions and counter kill combat but decided to pick this up after seeing the positive feedback it was receiving. I've really enjoyed exploring the massive world (sometimes too massive) and finding all the historical spots and godly weapons. Combat is way different than I remember, mostly in a good way (looking at you damage sponge enemies) but a really fun to tweak builds and skills to suit your playstyle and the Atlantis DLC has been a blast

First of all Ubisoft please make your games have actual decent optimization ...
Aight so...
great melee combat and progression
I LOVED the heck out of the skill varieties and versatility in making your build shine, almost making yourself OP af. I adore the power hunger fantasy of this game and if i think about, is really the under appreciated aspect about the game
They really doubled down on the world design. It's LITTERED with side quests and minor activities.
Not too many interesting things going on but still very fun to explore midway through the game.
However not a fan of the political ♥♥♥♥ thrown in during the story at all.
The grind is too much i'd agree even though im a sucker for grindy ♥♥♥♥, for this that was not needed as i think it would. Hopefully Valhalla looks to be at the same pace as origins and i only hope i get myself to play the DLCs one day of this game.
Great endgame too, filled with mythical bosses and stuff that you might've missed which after you can easily follow-up into the DLCs.
Overall i'd say if you loved origins and just like me a shill of the AC franchise, you should definitely play this game!! It deserves some love despite the mild criticism i've seen on it.

Assassin's Creed: Odyssey

Let me start this by saying the visuals of the game are amazing!
Sometimes i find myself just staring at the view far away, instead of paying attention to my current mission...
When i saw this game coming out, i tried my best to avoid all possible spoilers.
The whole gear and materials farming stuff was new to me in a Assassin's Creed game at the time.
I didn't mind it at al, sometimes it's good to try something new.
Soaked up some time in this game, none of those hours wasted in my opinion.

Like i said earlier, the visuals are amazing, but don't forget:
The graphics.
The storyline.
The characters.
The weather. *Example* the storm you sail in at moments.
And Markos's fine wine~

I've enjoyed the game a lot, not that it's the same as the very first few Assassin's Creed games, no.
This game on it's own, is a great game to spend your time on!

If you got a philosophy degree in college, this is the right game for you!!! This game will make wish you were alive back in the days of ancient Greece. Probably because you could actually make use of your degree and you could actually be somewhat successful in life. Sadly, it's 2018 and you're wondering why you spent $300k to argue in a circle for 4 years.

I've already put 150 hours into this beast on the PS4 and about the same time in Vahalla this month. It's a great game packed with content and one of the best female protag's in gaming history with Kassandra. It has some FPS drops but it still beats the console version. I can't recommend it enough.

It's been a long time since I haven't tried any of Assassin's Creed game, Odyssey is one of the great and memorable example in terms of playability and open world, Ubisoft did remarkable job on open world which surpised me at all, because dozens of games known by its huge map, but most of them can't be succeeded on providing varierty and filling the map, and it prevents you play again after you done with the storyline, but AC:Odyssey make you wonder of its amazing and huge map, discovering the lands and islands as well as side quests is worth spending time
the way how storyline progress is depend on your choises, as far as I know it has 4 different ends but don't expect to suprised during the storyline because ubisoft made the story as simple as they could, but I'm satisfied about it after all
I suggest you discover all the lands and islands to get the most out of it

First : Do not believe in game's story.it's just a new version of AC series with more fun and better graphic.
Second: Ubisoft means a game with some unexpected bugs. And there it is! This one is almost perfect but as I said,beware of unexpected bugs like stuck between the rocks when you try to jump-off from your horse! (and you will die in few sec after that happend)

Well well well. Another game, Another fun.
+Huge map , Lots of Fun and Adventure.
+Story is good , beside many decisions to make and you'll have you choose your story! (get the DLC's or buy the ultimate version for more)

+In the last update they've add something new! You can write your own story and play it.looks cool but it's not perfect yet.they should working on it (there is no voice only text chat ._.)

-Fire damage is completely sh!t . I mean , OP when it's against you, useless when you using it! If you start burning by Fire you'll die in few sec and in other hand if you put someone in fire they wont take much damage :) even with full skills for fire damage still it sucks. (same for poison damage)

Remember, it's Ubisoft ... can you handle it? buy it :)

What do I even say about this game? It's a great game, it is what it says it is. Sure, there's a couple memes in there, but not really anything political or modern day that's in your face like some similar games. The gameplay is solid and fun, the story is pretty good, though a couple voice actors are sorta hit or miss sometimes, but all the main characters do fine.

EVERYTHING IS SPELLED WITH K

Some complain about Ubisoft sometimes, but I have had no issue with this one whatsoever. The game also runs pretty well as long as you respect your computer's graphical limitations which a lot of people seem to ignore these days. I also have never had a crash in 150+ hours so far. I really, really have enjoyed this game a lot and I still haven't even finished 60% of it or so. Oh and some people were worried about microtransactions. They're there and they exist, but they're not required or even recommended to play the game. You can get along without them just fine. I actually found myself wishing I could lower the xp gain rate instead of increasing it. I often times would level up before my gear had a chance to update, but it's not a big issue later on. Overall, the balance of the game feels fine. The radiant quest system is there to generate extra xp options but I almost always get along fine with the normal sidequests which are sometimes very surprising in how big of an arc they are. Like at one point I hopped onto an island to explore that didn't seem like much and suddenly I'm overthrowing an entire corrupt underground gang society thing. The game has a lot to offer if you let it. I don't mind buying this game at full price, but if you still don't feel comfortable with full price, pick it up at 30% off or more, it is worth it.

It's really just deeply unfortunate that I'm writing a negative review for a game in one of my favorite series of all time, and what was - before Title Update 1.12, and the release of Legacy of the First Blade Episode 2 - likely going to be my current favorite game of all time. Long before October 2nd, 2018, I preordered the Gold Edition of Assassin's Creed Odyssey. I love Shao Jun, Evie Frye, and Aya of Alexandria dearly, but specifically knowing that a female protagonist would finally lead an entire mainline Assassin's Creed game if you chose them as your protagonist, just made me beyond excited. And when they showed that choices would be brought into an Assassin's Creed game for the very first time - all of that excitement was gone. Choice in an Assassin's Creed game went against everything we were told in the lore. I was racking my brains as to how they would make this work when the basis of an Assassin's Creed game, that you are experiencing the memories of someone long gone, was giving way to dialogue choices. And when they told us they were adding multiple romances to this formula too, as an AC fan, I was nervous. But I trusted that they would treat this game, and the fans who love their games, with respect, and honor the series as a whole. And I went against all my better judgment (and usual personal practice), and preordered the game. Because the more gameplay I saw, I felt like this game was something special. I felt like Ubisoft was trying something bold and fresh for one of their most beloved franchises. And I wanted to be part of that. And after seeing the premises of promised DLC, I knew I'd be genuinely upset if I missed out on them too.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the third game I have ever personally ever preordered for myself. When I say it's usual personal practice, I really do mean it.

And after 370 hours with this game, I wish I never had.

Before I get into why my review is negative, I just want to clear up a few things here. None of what I'm about to say is driven solely by my personal feelings and opinions. Rather, everything I'm about to say is because the product that Ubisoft has sold is not the product that I have received. In multiple ways. And I'm writing this review to bring that to peoples' attention. Because what Ubisoft has done, regardless of personal feelings, is wrong on a fundamental level of ethical business practice.

As a major part of the marketing for the game, creative director Jonathan Dumont and narrative director Melissa MacCoubrey talked about choices and romance within the game. Dumont said, "Since the story is choice-driven, we never force players in romantic situations they might not be comfortable with. Players decide if they want to engage with characters romantically. I think this allows everybody to build the relationships they want, which I feel respects everybody’s roleplay style and desires."

In Legacy of the First Blade Episode 2, no matter the dialogue options you choose, no matter the actions you take when completing the quests for that DLC episode, your character ends up with a child, with someone they are clearly meant to be romantically in love with. No decisions are made in this romantic situation, they are all made for you. And in designing the DLC to end this way, and no other, Ubisoft has lied. Your character reacts romantically in every interaction with their unchosen partner, with even the musical cues that played each time you romance a character smacking you over the head each time, just in case you missed it. Your character pines for this partner, cries over them, snuggles under the stars with them, and has a child with them - without a dialogue choice in sight. It's the only romance in Assassin's Creed Odyssey where you do not have any choice. On the most basic of levels, you are forced into this romantic situation. Even if you reject them outright, your character engages with this character romantically. Ubisoft, in marketing this game, sold a product on certain promises. Would I be writing a negative review if player choice was never in this game? If this was a game with fixed choices and romances, like every Assassin's Creed game before it? No, I would not. But Ubisoft did not honor promises made while marketing this game. As it stands, please don't give any of your money to this game, as the devs clearly shown that they do not deserve it. And if you need more reasons: The game's environments can be very copy-and-paste in a lot of areas, and the world, while filled with some unique areas, suffers for this. The optimization issues are frustrating, and I still experienced them no matter what settings I played at.

Now, the rest of what I'm about to say is driven solely by my personal feelings and opinions.
I'm a lesbian.
I hesitate to say this because I personally believe that there is so much more to me than being a lesbian. I love campy horror movies, I play guitar, and I have a bowl of the same cereal basically every day for breakfast. Also, while we're talking about food: pineapple on pizza debate? I really hate it.

I say this because, throughout my time with AC Odyssey, my Kassandra was played, from start to finish, as a lesbian. As I said above, I was just excited that I could play as Kassandra. That would have been enough for me. But when Melissa MacCoubrey said, "If you want to be a woman and romance a woman, you can do that. If you want to be a man and romance a woman, you can do that. If you want to be a man and romance a man and a woman, you can do that. We’re making a game that offers choice, and this is something that matters a lot to people. It matters a lot to me. And it matters a lot to the team," it really was with those words that I knew for absolute certain that my Kassandra would be a lesbian, like me. And I was totally free do exactly that. It almost didn't feel real, in a way. There was no ambiguity in the choices, no, "Are you really sure. though?" Once I made a decision within a romance, that was it. Decision completely respected.

And this DLC absolutely spits in the face of that. It was jarring to have my Kassandra visibly fall in love with this man, get pregnant with his child, and have to sit there and watch it all. It was jarring to have all of this happen only via dialogue-free cutscenes, accompanied by the music that played during some of my favorite romances of the game. And it is jarring for lesbian and bisexual women, whose decisions are not respected, who are told that they'll grow out of their little phase, who have been told they just need to find the right man, or who have literally undergone corrective r*pe to "sort out" their attractions. This DLC sends such a dangerous message, especially to women and the LGBTQ+ community; and, to make matters worse, the achievement for completing the DLC is titled "Growing Up". I shouldn't have to explain why that's wrong on multiple levels. Every time I loaded up Assassin's Creed Odyssey, it reminded me that, "This work of fiction was designed, developed, and produced by a multicultural team of various beliefs, sexual orientations, and gender identities." I don't know, then, how this team let this DLC be produced. I really don't.

I've never called any character in any Assassin's Creed game "my" anything. But I called the protagonist of Assassin's Creed Odyssey "my Kassandra" because I chose to play as her. Because I chose who she romanced. Because she was a Kassandra I could relate to and see some of myself in. Because I always had agency over her dialogue in some way, however small, and because player choice, specifically within romances, was highlighted so majorly as a selling point of this game. As of TU 1.12, I have uninstalled Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and on a matter of principle, I will not be purchasing any more Ubisoft games until you fix this. These were your own words, Ubisoft. And I can guarantee that the community that you lied to will hold you accountable for them.

(Actual hour count is ~30 hours less than Steam shows - left idling many times)

I am extremely conflicted on Assassin's Creed Odyssey. As I write this review, I'm not sure which way my binary choice of "recommend" or "not recomment" would lean... So let's list out some points, and by the time you read this review you'll see what I decided ultimately.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is many things;
First and foremost it's gorgeous. Well, the environments anyway. Animations are often janky, there's something off with all the character's faces and lipsync. But man, the environment and world is stunning to look at

It's also overflowing with content. Content which, with some exceptions, is fun for the entire duration of the game. Scouting out various temples and bases, deciding on the best route to infiltrate/complete objectives/kill everyone is engaging and enjoyable.

However, to get to that content you need to navigate the game (have I mentioned how beautiful the world is?). By this I mean lengthy periods of time of holding "W" on your keyboard. Sometimes Shift too! How exciting! Interacting with the menus within menus within submenus. And of course, the quests.

The quests turn this enjoyable checklist romp into a painful experience. I often found myself thinking "man, I could totally go for some more stealthy-combaty-gameplay" only to be blocked by boring, drawn out, poorly written, forced conversations and side objectives, to the point of turning the game off and coming back another day.

None of this is interesting or particularly well executed. Playing through this game made me yearn for a base-hunting roguelike, with all the unnecessary "fat" of Odyssey cut out and removed. No dialogues, quests, NPCs, levelling power creep... Just planning, assassinating and fighting.

I played this game over the course of 11-ish months, and had to take frequent breaks to prevent boredom and frustration - a trait I don't encounter in the many 100+ hour long games I play.

So why did I keep playing? The checklist-satisfaction factor is executed wonderfully in this game. Also it was something to do. A game to jump into in between playing other, better games.

I don't think I'll remember anything about playing this a few years from now. It's the kind of video-gamey fast food which you jump into to relax after a long day - something which was sorely needed in this year.

Anyway, ramblings aside and TL;DR:
Gameplay good but repetitive
World beautiful but too big
Systems introduced but underutilised
Gear customization fun but gear pointless once you acquire set bonuses
Abilities varied and interesting but enemies scale their health so much, it doesn't really matter
Quests have unique set ups, but abysmal execution

For every positive in Odyssey there's a negative to throw at it. To it's credit, it's the first Assassins Creed game I've been able to enjoy and actually finished- though I think I'll take a break before playing Origins/Valhalla/whatever is next for a long, long time.
At the end of my review I still don't know whether I "recommend" this game to others. There's a thousand more interesting, more risk taking, more medium-evolving games to try out and play. But there's also this game which will last you months and leave you sort of satisfied-but-constantly-wishing-it-did-these-other-things-like-better-games-do-it and coming back for more.

Yeah, idk.
Play as Kassandra if you do get it though.

Have I mentioned how pretty Ancient Greece is?

I was about to hit "Post Review" but thought of the parts where you play in modern day and how a w f u l they are. Maybe it's because I haven't played the other AC games, but interacting with Layla and crew feels like it was just wedged in there to attach the game to the AC universe - it would have been a much, much better experience without it.

Ultimately as I'm about to hit don't recommend, I don't think this is a "good" game. It is "fun" but doesn't do anything particularly interesting or particularly well. Other than the world. Man is it pretty.

I loved this game. Been playing every AC as them came out since 2 so I understand the complaints that are thrown onto this game, some of which I agree on. The main one being that the game has too many boring/repetitive side quests, which drags the game on longer than it should. If you're thinking about getting this, get all the expansions with it, they're amazing. Legacy of the First Blade is a treat if you're into the AC lore.

Don’t buy the game if u want to continuously enjoy the main story and consider doing side content is grind for u , don’t buy the game . This is not for u .
I am sick of seeing ppl who treat the game like Linear game , get pretty rekt in main story and crying about micro transactions in the game .

If u like action rpg with open world . This is for u, definitely recommend it , it filled with massive contents and even side quests are interesting. If u play the game like u play Skyrim , witcher 3 . There is zero grind in this game and don’t even need to touch this MT option .

90% of the ppl who complain everything about the game are the ppl who don’t even own the game . Actually, this game is one of the best Assassin’s Creed in series .

To be clear, this is the first Assassin's Creed Game I've ever pre-ordered and also the first I've ever bought on Steam. Simply because I loved the setting and tell you what, I'm really glad I did!

+ Really good story, which I can't really get into without spoiling anything.
+ Choices actually have consequences, some being small and some big.
+ Game is downright gorgeous to the detailed backgrounds and characters, making for some nice screenshots.
+ Huge open world where exploration is a must since there are so many interesting and beautiful areas to discover, full of exp, npcs with quests, treasure and things to kill.
+ Lots of Romance Options.
+ Like the gameplay with versatile combat and movement. Especially since the enemies no longer wait around taking turns for you to just counter attack them and no I did not play Origins so I have no idea if all these changes were implemented then. I also did not watch any videos in case I ever wanted to give it a try after this playing this game.
+/- The usual microtransactions crammed into a single player game which makes no sense, instead of just allowing the player to unlock everything by actually playing the game. I say that as a person who has no problem spending a few more bucks to get the cosmetic look I want in a game but only in a multiplayer/mmo always online game like For Honor or PoE. Not going to crucify anyone who actually buys them but it's a no no for me personally, just gonna grind for orichalcum in game, instead.
- Having to use Uplay at the same time as Steam, it just isn't as responsive as Steam. I mean there's a reason I bought it on Steam instead of Uplay but I still end up having to use Uplay, lol.

Overall the game is amazing and I recommend it to anyone new or old to the Assassin's Creed series. Here's to hoping the next one is actually set in feudal Japan!

Sometimes, i feel the need to say : "This is not Assassin's Creed, this is Sparta !" and other times i feel the need to say that this is the new Marvel Universe.
The major problem of this game is that is has no identity : it tries to be many things at the same time.
It looks like an incredible game on paper and you feel that this game is amazing when it isn't, it's simply empty...
Worst Assassin's Creed game and worst triple-A action rpg i ever played.

The combat is basically the same as in origins only a bit harder (and you really need to get used to the parrying). You can still get overwhelmed so be careful (for example I boarded a ship of my level and they killed my crew instantly and then attacked me as a group).The mappable abilities are also very useful and the spartan kick is soooooo satisfying. I’d say the naval is a bit more fast paced than in black flag (but that could just be me) and I think that boarding is really fun. I like that there are still “shanties” cause otherwise my voyages would be eerily silent. The soundtrack overall is pretty great (as with all ac games). The photo mode has been tweaked a bit and is still very fun to use (especially because the game is beautiful). The only nitpicky thing I have a problem with is the slightly zoomed out camera angle but I could get used to that. The game is overall really fun and I would definitely recommend it to any RPG fan. OK after thirty or so hours I have to say that Origins is still a better game. Don't get me wrong, this is still a game that offers a lot of fun hours of gameplay, but the world is so big that sometimes the important things get lost in the sea of content (which may be a positive for some and a negative for others).

I think assassin's creed brotherhood will always be my favorite out of the series but as someone who has played every single game I highly recommend this game if you like the combat style and or loot system. This game is more like the witcher 3 than older assassin's creed games and I think as someone who loves witcher that can only be a plus.
This game has a very slow dragging story that I wouldn't say is very good, it is quite basic compared to some of the other stories and is highly level gated through out the whole experience meaning you have to grind meaningless sidequests or objectives just to continue with the story unless you pay for xp bonuses.

I would give the base game a solid 8/10 but is addicting enough where I constantly come back every couple months.

The first dlc I enjoyed a fair bit but the second dlc was a drag and felt like it wasn't needed.

The new direction for assassins creed really improves in odyssey, though a lot of people seem dont like the whole proto-assassin/proto-templar stuff as combat and such is wildly different to prior installments.

the massive overworld is beautifully crafted and the fate of atlantis DLC is the best dlc i've played after shadowbringers (FFXIV), my very subjective view on this game is that'd you'd be hard pressed to find a game that matches up to it, the soundtrack is excellent, the voice acting is great and though not as many as their should be, actual decisions in quests do affect the world.

overall 9/10, an excellent rpg but lacks in a few areas but not in anything that majorly affects the experience, with that the game wont be to everyone's tastes especially if prior ac games have been played as they are very different in every aspect.

Don't buy. First off, once you reach the broken parts of the game, STEAM won't issue a refund since it's more than 2 hours into the game....I think it's deplorable that STEAM continues to sell broken content. They won't accept screenshots of the in-game Errors and Crashes.

A few things I dislike about the game:
1. QOL: I hate Ubisoft logins. They require you to login EVERY TIME, even if you select remember me! I use a password generator so it's not easy to remember. I tried to change my password and got stuck in an infinite loop of, CHANGE PASSWORD->Email has been set->Click email to reset password->select CHANGE PASSWORD-> Email has been sent...... I have several other steam games and NONE of them require this extra step to play a game I've bought.

2. No shield! They use 300 for a basis for the game intro. I seem to remember Lena Headey saying, "Spartan! Come home with your shield or on it." But no, The first thing the Dev team does is have Leonidas Throw his shield at an enemy never to be seen again. The enemies get a Shield...

3. Can't pick up items or armor off of enemies... I must be spoiled from Skyrim. But the cost to upgrade gear is so high, you can never keep up with the $$$ and materials, so you either break a set bonus or use WAY UNDER LEVELED GEAR. I like the Legendary Gear and don't want to spend all day with Micro-transactions EVERY LEVEL.... Plus scrapping items should show you what scrap you'll receive. Scrap all great items, sell the blue and purple I guess.

I don't know why I didn't review this after beating it, see those 193 hours? That's one playthrough. ONE. You worried about the game straying too far from Assassin's Creed? Just spec assassin skills and play stealthy and you get the same experience. The game is huge and so fun, easily my favourite in the whole series. AC: Valhalla is a bit of a downgrade from this, this is peak.

Odyssey is such an amazing Open World RPG game, me being an RPG lover loved every aspects of this amazing game. The Graphics are stunning, the world is mind blowing. The story is also great! I love how I can be a Spartan once and then an Athenian again with no consequence xDD
Kassandra the Eagle Bearer, they made the character so detailed and epic!
It's a big shame that Valhalla didn't come to steam :(
I love AC Odyssey and recommend this amazing game to everyone. Try it first and be amazed, give it time to bedazzle you.
Ubisoft nailed it with this game!

The game lives up to the name--it is an Odyssey. It is a game for the ages with stunning graphics, excellent gameplay, good characters and stories, H-U-G-E open world--you name it. I would have liked to see some more boss battles and to fight the Kraken. Those are my gripes.

I pre-ordered this paying full price + the season pass, then like a moron waited 2 YEARS to get around to playing it when I probably could have picked it all up on sale for less than $20, but I can still say I don't regret it. The last Assassin's Creed game I put any serious time into was 2 but after dabbling in some of the other iterations I've noticed that the connection to the word "assassin" is getting less and less relevant with each game and I think that's a good thing. I also haven't seen hide nor hair of the ridiculous modern day story that connects the whole series together since the initial cut scene and I say good riddance to that as well. What this series has become is an excuse to do open world combat games in historical time periods and it does it exceeding well. So what you've got here is an opportunity to run around ancient Greece during the war between Sparta and Athens and just doing that is way fun. Seriously, I get my money's worth just sailing around at the helm of my very own warship enjoying the scenery while my sailors sing sea chanties in Greek. "Spartan kicking" enemies ala The 300 is awesome too, and of all the armored helmets in history I challenge you to name me one that's cooler than the big "I'm so badass I can wear a scrub brush on my head and nobody laughs" version.

To my action-game-adverse friends I say pick it up on the cheap now that Valhalla is out, put combat on easy mode and just enjoy it for the scenery and history. This one is definitely worth your time if only just for that.

**************

Update: A couple of thoughts deeper into the game. Yes, the modern day story has reared it's head a couple of times now and it's full of callbacks and nods to the other games that I don't understand but they've been thankfully short. An underlining current of the story does seem to be designed to connect all the games together but I'm confident that it's still going to be able to be taken as a sideshow and the main story is going to have it's own satisfying conclusion independent of all that.

Second, my main concern going into this was which main character I should play, you get to choose male or female. Every review I read raved about the female voice actress and having gone that route I tend to agree... I really like her delivery. My worry was romantic options. I like to think of myself as open minded but I've never been able to get invested in romantic plots outside my own gender and sexual preferences. (Which makes me really appreciate what things used to be like in gaming for women and members of the LGBT community.) However it really hasn't been an issue here. I'm far enough in that I'm fairly certain there's no Mass Effect Tali or Fallout 4 Piper in this game. The options of that sort seem to all be quick "wham, bam, thank you ma'ams," so if Kassandra wants to have a quick romp in the hay with a noble or a priestess every now and then I say "you go girl." Aphrodite would be pleased.

Also, I know some of my female gamer friends have very valid concerns about how women are portrayed in fantasy, so I'll tell you this: Kassandra wears the same armor that everyone else does. Yeah, she shows leg, but so do the men. Greek armor is all about the skirts. But while she's definitely feminine she's athletically built so there's no need for custom made breastplates, and certainly not ones with big vulnerable points built in so the gals can show cleavage. That contoured muscle-ripped stuff Greeks are always portrayed wearing looks good on her. Definitely as badass but even more respectfully portrayed than even the recent Wonder Woman movies. Given that everyone else is running around wearing togas, you'll see much more chest from the male NPCs giving quests. Geez, this game's got more chest hair than a hillbilly water park, but I digress...

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is my 8th AC game (not counting the ones I haven't finished yet, like Liberation and AC1). It is incredibly enjoyable. There's so much stuff to do, and the world of Greece is just so much fun to explore. In saying that though, I do believe the main questline is lacklustre, and the modern day parts in this are some of the worst this franchise had to offer (long post):

The good:
- The world is gorgeous and is an absolute treat to explore. Greece was so beautifully recreated. I spent a lot of hours just running around and exploring.
- The combat! Even better than AC Origins! I absolutely loved the different abilities, especially those in the Assassin branch.
- YOU CAN SPARTA KICK ENEMIES. IT'S OVER, YOU HAVE THE HIGH GROUND.
- Like AC Origins, you can climb almost anything,
- There were some absolutely AMAZING support characters (and associated quests) like Barnabas, Herodotos, and Alkibiades. I love all their interactions with Kassandra.
- The cult system was an interesting way of implementing an "assassination" list kind of mechanic. It could have been improved, but I think it had great potential, and should be revisited in future games.

The meh:
- Kassandra (or Alexios') story is very lackluster. I'm not saying it's horrible, it's definitely not the worst story, but there wasn't a single point in it that made me go WHOA, or "HOLY SH**.
- Kassandra was rather bland, but I think this was a conscious decision due to the fact that there are "branching" paths to take in this game based on your choices.
- I was not a huge fan of having dialogue options. Ignoring the fact that the choices presented in this game are uninteresting, there are very few parts where your actions have any impact to the world, and some of them don't really make a lot of sense. Plus, you can be a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but still end up a good guy?
- The writing in this game is generally just bland. There aren't any profound lines or parts that would impress. A large part of the story and the sidequests are forgettable.
- Naval combat. I don't really have much to say about it except that it felt like a chore.
- HOW CAN YOU HAVE ROMANCE OPTIONS AND NOT LET US SLEEP WITH 

The bad:
- Assassinations are not insta-kill, even if the target is sleeping. I mean come on? How do you survive a knife to the neck?
- You don't have a hidden blade. Which is understandable, but also still kind of disappointing.
- All of the modern day parts are duller than a butter knife. Layla is absolutely the most boring character I've ever had the displeasure to play as.
- There is very little interaction with the world. You can't sit on chairs to hide or blend with crowds (an issue I also had with Origins). You can't really interact with the people on your boat and start conversations.

Overall, AC Odyssey is a really fun game. But it did not amaze me or touch me in the way that Origins did. When I play an AC game, I do not want to decide how it's going to end, I want to be taken on a wild ride. I think having "choices" forced the story to go in certain directions that were bland or boring, and didn't allow the devs to take more risks with it. Still, I enjoyed this game A LOT. And I think people who are on the fence should give it a chance, because the gameplay is really good.

Most time I have ever spent playing a video game... I have played all of the AC games and am always intrigued by them. I love exploring different historical time periods and being a bad ass while doing it. AC:Odyssey is a great game. Extremely massive game with so many places to discover and quests to complete. Some awesome gear to find as well. It definitely has its flaws in repetitiveness and some weak points in the story. However, I enjoyed it. It took me almost two years to complete the full main story and both DLC arcs. I would put it down for awhile at a time but kept coming back as I knew I wanted to finish eventually. Happy to have completed it and can't wait for Valhalla!

Love this game.

It is not particularly AC style of game, but it is surely better than that. It should have been a new IP instead.

Just don't play on any difficulty less than nightmare to enjoy it at its peak. Enemies are way smarter makes up for more realistic gameplay.

Updated Review: still 1000/10. starting a New Game+ for self-care reasons and even knowing what happens I am still so excited to play through it and experience all the epic and emotional moments again. This game does a wonderful job of getting you invested in many of these characters; loving certain ones and hating others lol - I've truly never felt so connected to a game world before.

If you're not totally certain you'll get into this game, wait for another sale and then do yourself a great favor and get the Gold Edition. Legacy of the First Blade can choke, but The Fate of Atlantis more than makes up for that atrocity and it is one of the most incredible, epic, and beautiful pieces of gaming content I've ever played through and if you're a Greek mythology nerd like I am then you will be blown away by it.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: i know i am very early into this game but still...this has easily become one of my all-time favorite games, and i am usually not able to get into single-player games very much.

the visuals are gorgeous - the details and the environments are spectacular, and the customization options you get as you continue to progress are really nice.

combat is very fun. i am enjoying building abilities around all three of the combat classes. the various weapons and armor you can earn and buy is great too as their stats will help you build various load outs and overall builds to enhance the different class abilities.

and the story and characters are great. i have especially enjoyed how you can choose your romantic partners in this game - it adds a lot of depth for a player to express their own identity in the game, and that is something that is really incredible.

i snagged the gold edition during the Steam holiday sale, but I would say without a doubt that this game is worth paying full-price for it. i've loved every second i've played it and i can't wait to continue!

A amazing game with a incredible landscape and accurate historical events .But sometimes i miss the old Assassin's Creed games without the element of RPG.The Atlantis DLC I think brings the taste of old Assassin's Creed with the Isu (those who came before) and the artifacts

Something I legitimately did not think I would be saying about an Assassin's Creed game:
"Wow, I honestly thoroughly enjoyed this...."

No really, this was well made and the world is beautiful, the story pulled me along, the humour was good, the animations were great and all-in-all it was really well polished.
I think the reason that I actually loved this was the series' move to a more rpg like style, and I feel that whilst its nowhere near as good as something like The Witcher 3, or Skyrim, this definitely is an enjoyable experience the even had me playing the DLC which took literally a further 30 or so hours to finish!

Oh yeah, the DLC, incredible, the Atlantis setting truly is a breath of fresh air from what you see in the typical Greek map, it's entirely different and has 3 vast maps that each have a separate story to tell with unique bosses.

HOWEVER, the optimisation is sh*t, running at 1440p on a gtx 1080 I wasnt able to max this and get a solid 60 fps, with some tweaking I was able to hover around the 60fps mark, but in some areas it was easily possible to drop to the low 40's
The spongey enemies that take SO MANY FREAKING HITS just to kill is annoying!

The idea of making in Greece was fabulous but there is a thing that we loved assassins creed before where the wonderful story, For today no good story. Maybe because of Ezio trilogy people now want more. So far the story is slight good, graphics is good and I like the idea of learning the Greek Mythology,

Please Ubisoft. Make next arc will be in Japan

AC Odyssey is a work of art. It looks gorgeous. The character models are good. The world is huge and it feels alive.

You have a lot of stuff to do:
- running (or horsing) around the world, exploring, fighting few opponents
- main guests or side guests (those are not very good most of the time),
- fortresses, which generally means changing the pace and playstyle
- conquest battles
- sailing, sea battles
- managing your inventory and character

It does not have the strongest mechanics, but they are doable. The combat is enjoyable, but it doesn't register all the inputs, which can be infuriating, especially if you are fighting a lot of opponents and it doesn't register your parry.

It's a game in which you can sink hundreds of hours. It gets repetitive, but the sheer amount of different things to do helps.

It has one HUGE problem though. The balance of currency and experience was sabotaged by developers themselves, to make you buy "time savers". That's a real pity. They deliberately made their own game worse. By a lot.

Still, it's a great game.

I love assassins creed for its historical background and the stealth gameplay. unfortunately, assassins creed odyssey has moved away from this in a major way. I cant recommend this as a good assassins creed game, but as a historical fantasy rpg, it is incredible.

I would recommend this if you are a die-hard fan of AC or just a fan of rpgs in general, but I just cant recommend it to those expecting to find any of the elements of previous assassins creed games

Edit- ive come back to this game after about a year or so and im really warming up to it. the bounty hunter system is a fun addition and an improvement on the phylaketes(?) of AC Origins.

Absolutely Phenomenal, I Truly Thought the series would tank hard after Unity , and AC had peaked out at Origins . Everything about this game is just great. The setting, the mythology, the voice actors, the progression and leveling system, the music and choices are very similar to The Witcher 3, which IMO Devs should Learn from The Witcher 3. Get the game if it's on sale, it's a steal. I wouldn't pay $60 for many games now day's, But I would for AC odyssey this is 100% worth it. Wp AC/Ubisoft team.

The Game is great for those times that you have no one else to play with, but you just want to have some fun.
Even though my PC needs MANY upgrades the game runs reasonably well at 30 FPS, on medium.

Great for When your board

This is by far my favorite Assassin's Creed game.
The story was enjoyable and memorable.
Combat and ship sailing are both fun.
Just an overall good time.

If you enjoyed Assassin's Creed: Origins, you'll love this game. The world in this game is vast and glorious, the characters are all memorable, so far the plot is fantastic, there are more RPG elements like actual important dialogue choices, and combat flows a lot better than Origins.

I can see myself pouring a good 100+ hours into this game for sure

I usually write in depth reviews, but it's late - so bear with me.

-Graphics and Sound-
The graphics in the game are honestly really phenominal. I have a GTX 1080 and a i7-8700k, ran it on high for a solid 60 frames with a 3440x1440p 21:9 ratio monitor. Armor is extremely well detailed, characters are amazingly done, and the effects - oh my god the effects. At first you don't notice it because of all the sounds of combat, but I took a listen in on the "flame" effect when you slather your sword in fire - holy gods (pun intended) it sounded so damn realistic to actual fire behavior when you swung it. The game's pocked full of those little, minute details that make you giddy when you recognize what they are, just for that little bit of immersion - despite how unrealistic the game is, not that that is bad.
But I digress.

-Gameplay-
This is not a traditional Assassin's Creed game. This is most certainly like Origins, and is totally unlike my childhood; the childhood being hundreds of hours collectively on Brotherhood, Revelations, III, Black Flag, II, etc. However, you can still do Assassin-esque things, such as (whad'ya know) assassinations! However, you need to spec your build right, albeit you can have balance between "Warrior" and "Assassin" to be able to do good damage in combat, but also stealth-kill enemies. Otherwise, you'll end up just doing a "stealth attack" that doesn't instantly kill the enemy for you. I was a bit dispassionate to see this so early game, where your Assassin damage was commonly so low that it only took enemies down to 25%-40% health. But, at end-game, you'll be fine.

Either way, the combat is fun, flows well, and has little to no glitches or bugs to iron out, at least in my experience. Abilities and overpower attacks are satisfying, finishers are brutal (but not too brutal, to some people's dismay), and overall it was a very enjoyable experience.

It should also be noted that I was never forced into combat throughout the entire game; as in, I always had that choice to stealth or run in flaming-sword-ablaze. You could assassinate your target after getting rid of all his guards first, then lure him out and whack him in a bush, or you could simply dive head-first into a full crowd of elite enemies and hope your strategic way of bouncing around works. If you play on the hardest difficulty, you die in /literally/ 2-4 hits, so I would take the more tactful approach.

-The Cash Shop-
Never needed it, didn't dabble in it, never even clicked on it. As soon as the game was finished and over, I had my character build, my armor set, and no need to address anything from there. Yeah, some decent customization was prevalent. but I was never encouraged enough to buy them or need it otherwise. No need to buy EXP boosts, no need to buy upgrades for my ship in the form of Captains. Nothing. Ever. You getting my long, drawn-out point for all those who are saying "MuH cAsH shOp iN sInGlE pLayEr gAme?" Yeah, it sucks ass that they did it - but as long as it doesn't interfere with the gameplay, and I still get god-like looking armor regardless; what's the point of complaining? When it starts doing either, that's when you have a problem. But this is a review, not a 4chan board!

-The Experience and Story-
Some things were kind'a predictable, but a lot wasn't. Oh man when you figure out who the head of the antagonist faction is, my jaw dropped with a loud "WHAT". But, I'll say I learned a /ton/ about Greek culture and mythos. Obviously, not on-par representation as reading into the actual Odyssey, or other stories that have been foretold; but even so, it infatuated me over the course of the game. Was truly interesting to look into, especially after reading a book about Greek philosophy.

Anyways, overall it was a good game. Heartfelt moments at times, even by just simple side characters. Heart-string tugging. Would rate it a solid 9/10; the 9 because it's an RPG stamped with the AC name, so a bit of disappointment still lingers in me. But that's just my bias.

AC: Odyssey was the first game I've played in a long time where I actually had FUN. I'm new to the AC franchise so I can't compare this to previous AC games, but as a standalone I really like it.

RE: Exp grind
There has been plenty of criticism about the exp grind and stuff. Personally, I don't find that to be the case at all. I hit max level about 65% into the main quest, and I'm not even OCD about completing every objective before moving on. If you do a couple of location objectives / sidequests alongside the main quest, you shouldn't have a problem with exp. There are also plenty of repeatable (albeit boring) 'side quests' that offer a ton of exp for something simple, like killing an NPC or delivering an item.

RE: Microtransactions
I'm someone who's quite liberal about spending on lootboxes, but I haven't felt the urge to make a single microtransaction in this game. I was worried that the game was balanced around microtransactions, but upon finishing it I can say that I haven't spent anything extra on microtransactions, and have needed nothing from the cash shop to thoroughly enjoy the game.

RE: Resource grind
Resource cost for upgrading gear is pretty insane. If you're upgrading your gear at the blacksmith every level for some reason, then yes, you will run out of resources. However, gear upgrades drop all the time in the game. If you replace your gear with upgrades that you find (like in a regular RPG), and only upgrade your "endgame gear" when you're near/at max level, then resources aren't much of a problem.

----

Pros:
+ Kassandra <3
+ Overall, the 3 'main' plot lines were interesting; they kept me intrigued despite the length.
+ Really large game, huge map, good amount of content and exploration, long quest chains.
+ Beautiful graphics!
+ Plain FUN: Sparta-kicking people off cliffs, scaling every imaginable surface, chain assassinations, blowing people's heads off with arrows that hit like cannonballs, naval battles, investigating a cult, etc.
+ Romance options are mostly hilarious. They're definitely shallow as far as RPG relationships go, but the blatant flirting and general horniness from the MC/NPCs make me laugh every time.
+ Voice acting is pretty good overall, although there were some moments where I felt like the voices were over-dramatised.
+ Kassandra <3

Cons:
- Illusion of choice: Unlike 'full' RPGs, only a handful of options throughout the dialogue actually has consequences.
- Some of the animations look a little clunky / repetitive
- Personally, the endings / conclusions of the main plotlines were kind of a let down for me. The journey definitely >>> the destination in my case. This was the biggest flaw for me, because I had so much fun during the 100 hours of gameplay, only to be let down at the end by a mediocre ending. YMMV though.
- Replayability: Considering that dialogue options matter so little, I wouldn't be replaying it to see different outcomes. I also haven't seen much of endgame content at the moment.

----

Overall, compared to a 'proper' RPG, the story / choice elements are lacking a little, but overall, it's still a great game that provided me about a hundred hours of solid fun. And a new pixel wife, because Kassandra is amazing.

I played and completed the first Assasins Creed back in 2007/8 and the second one after that and never went near another AC game until now,

I look at the negative reviews on steam for this game at present and they are totally laughable, petty complaints best served for the discussions rather than a game review.

Since there are alot of really nice extensive views on this game already, all I can say is alot of work has went into this game to make it truely outstanding, I like the time period the game is set in, the story line is intriguing, the map is huge and beyond what i expected, lots of replayability and gaming hours for this game, it has the potential to be a classic if it isn't already.

If you like the videos, stop goping and go buy it.

This is probably my favorite and most time invested RPG since Fallout 3. I know people have varying opinions about Ubisoft, but in my opinion, they have done an awesome job sticking by and supporting their games, and ACO represents the pinnacle of their work. There are literally hundreds of things you can do in this: Main Quest line, side missions, ship battles, take on epic beasts, hunt down weekly targets, or just explore the world.

For me, this is a great chill game after a tough day. You can literally just ride your horse around and find something on your map that will further along the 10-15 different quest lines you are part of, from the main story (which is a great tale of revenge and redemption) to the typical MMO style- kill 10 wolves and get a reward. This game feels like a MMO, minus the other players, which works fine for most lone wolf type players. I also appreciate the ship game play IS NOT tedious and actually makes you want to design/upgrade your ship, especially the ones you defeat as part of weekly quests. It is very fun firing arrows into enemy ship then boarding them to fight the crewman.

Another good aspect of this game is armor and weapon customization. You can definitely look and play like a Spartan from 300, and the armor is absolutely awesome in this regard: various helmet designs with almost anything you would see in a movie or history book to custom swords/staffs/bows that have a variety of designs (my favorite is the "vine bow"). Also, if you want to rock the whole old school assassins look, there are outfits and abilities that match this style as well.

My only real negative is the repetition of the side missions, but honestly, how many unique mission types can you put into a game? There is bound to be some repeats, even in the Witcher 3 (love the game like everyone else).

If you are looking for Dark Souls like difficulty, then pass on this because you will find it too easy. But for the majority of us casual gamers who like historical settings and easy to root for heroes, then this is definite BUY. Ubisoft does not skimp on you at all, fully worth the $100 I paid for the Gold Edition and a crazy good deal for those who waited for a sale.

Like AC Origin, but even bigger. Nothing not to like about this game if you loved Origin like I did.
It's like a massive new DLC for 60 bucks. Looks like Origin, plays like Origin. It seems to be Origin with minor changes.

Odyssey, an Assassin's Creed spin-off...

Ubisoft, made this game from the cut content of Origins. Which, was supposed to contain a huge chunk of Greece as well. And didn't bother to market it as such, out of fear that some people might not buy it. Now, if you've played every single AC game, you'll notice from the get go, that Odyssey isn't even close to being one. Which contrary to its title, has nothing to do with the Assassin Brotherhood nor the Templar Order. Though, I appreciate the furthering of lore, with the whole Cult of Kosmos. And even so, Odyssey is simply put, as but a virtual tour of Ancient Greece, with a decent story and RPG mechanics.

Therefore, this should settle the argument that Odyssey isn't an AC game. It is and isn't at the same time. It is perhaps, an unintentional spin-off (doubt it). Who knows...It's entirely up to the player to decide what an AC game is. If some consider this one to be a valid entry into the series, then I guess it is. Other won't. And Ubisoft must've been aware of this. Mind you that before Origins came out, the magic of series started to be wear off for at least a couple of years. Therefore, they made a choice to make their next game a bit different, could be why Odyssey sold better than Origins...

But, obviously, I think it could've been so much better if they would've given me a Hidden Blade from the beginning, instead of that horrendous Spear of Leonidas...
Which ! By the way, Kassandra or Alexios, for that matter, along with Ubisoft. Can shove up their-

Anyway...

I bought the game in 2018, when it released, and later did the same for its DLC. Yet, as I kept playing it I found myself more than often, exploring and taking screenshots than doing the main quests. This is the only AC game I have yet to finish. Not because it has a lengthy main story, but rather features, the least compelling AC story to date. It simply didn't hook me alike Origins did, for example. It still doesn't. To be honest I don't think I'll ever finish this one. Which means I've wasted my money on an AC game ! A first for me. I've even finished Syndicate, which prior to Odyssey's release I've considered to be the worst AC game, as far as the story is concerned. I still do in a way. Though it's understandable, because among other Ubisoft studios, the same studio, Ubisoft Quebec, worked on Odyssey as well...

Regarding combat, it's similar to Origins, improved in some areas, yet I found their choice to ditch the shield in favor for a more active combat style, a bit daft. Since it would've offered slightly more complexity to their system. And Spartans used shields in combat !

Thus, in conclusion, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, is a decent open-world RPG, but nothing close to the best AC game. (Ezio's trilogy being the best. Followed by Black Flag, and from there, it's heading downward until Origins, then back into the abyss.). Which could've been a whole lot better if the main character was an actual member of an early Hellenic version of the Assassin Brotherhood instead of a mercenary. Which, (the Assassin part), they poorly introduce in the Legacy of the First Blade, when it could've been something for the main game and explored in greater detail. And by the way, the whole expansion was developed by Ubisoft Singapore.

It's clear that Ubisoft heavily leans towards turning Assassin's Creed into a Witcher-esque kind of a game. A choice with which I've no problem with, The Witcher 3 was a masterpiece. And Assassin's Creed Valhalla seems to further their path into that particular direction. Though, I've an issue with straying from the roots of what Assassin's Creed games used to be, from a narrative standpoint. You know, the fight and struggle of the Assassin cause, against the Templar Order. Which had been pushed in the background in the recent years, for the historical setting, it seems. More concerned with a particular conflict, then the interest of
what the Assassin Brotherhood can gain in influence, while stopping yet another Templar stratagem. More preoccupied on the personal gains of the main character, then what could he or she offer to the Assassin cause. Therefore I fear yet another pointless game, vague as as far as Assassin-Templar war goes.

It did take 2 years to review this game, because I didn't know whether I should bother to do it or not. It was weird, as I've never been as frustrated with an AC game before...

If you lost hope in the franchise odyssey is here to bring you back. First and foremost I enjoyed the refreshing twist on the gameplay. Nightmare mode is how you want to play this whether your good or bad this makes you chose your comfort zone in the game and sets your pace for how you will conquer the world. I've found its become a challenge to confront your foes and take them out head on as you would coming in as a warrior, so much so I've went down the road of how i preferred the first couple titles, you know being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ assassin. Choosing to go through the whole mission stealthily because its how you would prefer the fight as opposed to just assassinating a few guys until everyone finds you forcing you to parry through 50 gaurds at the same time because you dont have to worry about consequences. Here I invest into my stealth approach, finding my angle in and finding the best method to dismantling the guards ahead of time to avoid the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if im caught as my guy aint up for that ♥♥♥♥. needless to say im finding this game gives u a reason to be stealthing about which is what a lot of "stealth" experiences miss completely these days. That being said you want to ♥♥♥♥ up the ♥♥♥♥ like leonidas sure you can but you have to spend the amount of planning as i do picking camps apart, just you have to pick your loadout wisely and know your foes. Love this freedom and gives me real satisfaction coming out against the odds in situations gone sideways because i managed to come out by the skin of my teeth.
Moving on to building your character which is really well done, weapons armor and your perk choice force you to keep your gameplay in mind, not just cheesing out max armor but picking your armor wisely in sets or for their buffs individually to enhance a more diverse approach your encounters. This becomes well controlled later on as you now can make your loadouts and instead of being confined to your choices in the beginning you can now switch your lane and experience everything in a different way without losing out on your main style.

I could continue about story and graphics but these are things you need to see and feel for yourself, if your nostalgiac of the old days of ass creed you wont be moved by the charm of markos or the naievity of phoibe, just know theres more then beats the eye here as well. give your old ass a slap and get back in the creed im tellin you it will be a blast.

It's like they took the best mechanics from all the games around and threw them all in one nice cohesive package with an amazing story. Unforunately 24 hours of gameplay in at level 14 and the game has started crashing constantly. Running on an AMD FX-8350 and Radeon RX 580 and I can't play for more than 15 minutes before the game crashes or I get a BSOD. Amazing game, just wish I could play it right now.

Update: Not recommending until it remembers my damn choice to hide photos.
Final Update: Cyberpunk 2077 made me realize this game was amazing compared to a company that lied about not censoring the game.

I've played the main game and every DLC for it. I would not recommend this for any normal/long term fan of the AC series. This is not AC. It's an ok RPG but the missions are repetitive and mainly consist of: go here, collect this, kill this person and come back ...but for 200 hours. These games use to be way better, have better story, certainly a lot less fantasy elements and were much shorter. Now it's just a big mess consisting of lack of focus, more effort on graphics than story and content over quality. I used to love the series and kept giving it chances in the hope that it would recapture the glory that it used to have. I have to face the facts that it will never be like that again. It's just not something I enjoy any more. It seems pointless to play this really. Hell there are barely even Assassins in AC now. It's a joke.

To me it is the best in the series next to AC2. Ubisoft rolled the dice when they decided to go full RPG I think it worked well for them. Probably gotta be a fan of the series to fully enjoy this game but I'd say you would get your monies worth with this game regardless about 80hrs to fully beat the story.

If you looking for game to just roam around exploring while going through a decent story this game is probably what your looking at.

Story 7/10
Gameplay 9/10
Visuals 10/10
Audio 7.5/10

The only con I've came across this game is that some quests are still a bit buggy but Ubisoft have been working on fixing them. But no major quests that I've seen had any bugs just side missions and if you completionist that would be the only annoyence

Odyssey is a pretty solid game. For a series that wasn’t originally for the sandbox rpg category, Ubisoft has done a nice job creating an engaging game with a fun and fast-paced combat system. I can tell, in some ways, that they are new to the RPG category but I feel like their next couple of titles could be really good if they keep on improving.

I played my first time through as Kassandra. Ha, and one big thing I really noticed is that how all the love interests, if they were female, tended to be badass warrior types (Daughters of Artemis, Roxana). But the love interests that were male? Yeah, not so much. (A bland healer, a gross blacksmith, a weak chef and his brother with severe PTSD)

Not one big burly warrior flirted with my girl Kassandra, who is built like a damn Amazon and has the skill to back it up. Not even Brasidas, who I was like, “OH, finally! Someone worth Kassandra’s time!” But you get nothing. Oh, or that rebel leader Kira and her devoted Spartan boyfriend that she clearly didn’t deserve. She basically throws herself at you no matter what, of course, but he stayed loyal the whole time. Poor guy. (And then he just disappeared for a while only to show up at the party and get poisoned? Boooooo.

||||EDIT: Hey, so I did find that if you basically ONLY pay attention to Thaletas, get his helm for him in the Wreck of the Ajax [that the game helpfully does not mention the name of], you can hook up with him, but you have to work harder at it. He doesn't stay with you, even if he survives the party [the lunatic Sokrates has you free on Delos will come to Mykonos and poison Thaletas, if you let him go before the party takes place], but Kyra was not mad at all.

Like, she literally said, "Oh, I know about you two having fun. You taught him a few things."

And then I just died laughing. Did not expect that. So props on that one, AC: Odyssey.|||||||||


So the love interest thing appears to be mostly for Alexios (or lesbians, of course), who has a bunch of choices for the heterosexual male gamer, but basically nothing for any aggressive ladies.

I started a second playthrough as Alexios and it’s pretty stark, how different it is after playing as Kassandra. The LToG’s Old Flames Burn Brighter cracked me up when you go to the festival with WhatEverHerNameWas and the merchant is like, “Oh, hi, to you and the lovely lady!”

And she and Kassandra just kinda look at each other, as if they both know he is referring to the civilian. Whereas, I kinda chuckled and was like, “Huh, which one of us do you think he means?”

For the DLC featuring Natakas, I thought he was really bland. Darius was far more interesting to me. And because I did Natakas first, I thought he seemed pretty timid, naive and not all that skilled. Overall, he was dull and disappointing.

But then as Alexios meeting Neema, seeing how Natakas/Neema have all the same bland lines and reactions, it became pretty apparent that Neema was written for Alexios, almost a Mary-Sue, to have his baby. With Kassandra it seems weird that she had a baby at some point with the last 3 months, I’d guess, but physically and emotionally, is not that different. Those kinds of details stick out to me because it feels fake and breaks the immersion. It also comes off like yes, Kassandra is the canon character but they didn't commit to that. She may be canon but the story was written for Alexios.

Again, overall the game was really solid. Plot was interesting and had some twists. I was suspicious of Aspasia immediately after the thing with Phoebe and I ended up right about that. I wasn’t entirely sure for a while, if your mom was actually on your side or not. And that was cool. I liked that, rather than having her just be really bland too. (Or like Aya, from Origins, who everyone talked her up like she was amazing and then she was a huge letdown in terms of both skill and her unlikable personality.)

It wasn’t really clear if your younger sibling’s father was the same as yours (making you Double Special with those two bloodlines). There’s at least five years age difference? Six? And Deimos is a baby when taken. So did Mom pop back to that island another time or was Deimos’ father Nikolaos? Deimos was special because the bloodline through Mom. The elder sibling was special from Mom’s blood and actual-Dad’s blood?


This is a technical bit but I was able to sneak in and kill Lagos before I got his related quests from Brasidas and Mom. I was like, “Oh crap. I already killed that guy.” I got really into the Assassin abilities.

Sometimes it seems like maybe the programmers thought, “Oh, there’s no way they’ll do this before accomplishing this other thing.” Nah, man. Nah. Especially with the Plus option when you restart. (Pilgrim’s Set + 5-person assassinate streaks) I do not remember one NPC I needed alive, compared to the hundreds you take out during the game. Might be good to hide Lagos until you get the actual quests. Because Brasidas and I had to investigate still but when we met outside Fort Samos, it auto-finished the quest as if I’d gone and killed him. So I was like: Boooooooo! But then, before the battle of Amphipolis, where you meet Brasidas again, he says, “Lagos is alive thanks to you. I trust you.” And that made me go, “Wait, what? LOL” But then the events will still play out like I killed him.

Phidias is the other one. I got into the Cult snake temple and ran into the weak guy afraid to kill Phidias way before I met the guy. So when I did meet him, everyone is saying he’s nuts for thinking someone is after him. But I already knew someone was after him but Kassandra didn’t seem to know. And then when he is interrogated by Deimos, afterwards, Kassandra was like, “Wow, I guess someone really was after you.” And I’m like, “Well YEAH, we knew the Cult was after him?! WTF”

Oh yeah, I think it was the Pythia (Main Game) and Sokrates (DLC)--while wearing the Pilgrim Armor Set, I slipped inside of restricted areas to see them without killing any of the guards. But the game dialogue limited me to saying I had killed the guards or, in Sokrates case, I could choose to Lie and say I hadn't killed them. Even though that was not a lie. Just another bit of goofiness there.

So the game has solid fight mechanics but the dialogue and relationship options feel sort of stilted and awkward. Like in TES: Skyrim, yes, you can have relationships but they’re not very 3-dimensional. I feel like with some real editing polish (also because of spelling errors I caught in the subtitles), this would be good prep for their next game.

The DLC’s god realms though were really interesting. Hades’ realm in particular was cool. Though the bit with Brasidas being condemned because he pushed a woman out of his way and her unborn baby was accidentally killed—that whole thing was weird. He’s been a warrior his whole life. He’s had to kill tons of people. But the accidental death is the one that damns him? That seemed disproportionate. You can make a sad story out of anyone that is killed, but the baby’s death was accidental. I’m not saying it was right or good, just that it seems odd that that is the death that condemns him, rather than a death that was intentional.

Oh, and when I try to take command of my ship, Herodotus often gets in the way because of the AOE, I assume?

An issue this game and Origins both have is that sometimes the bad guys and soldiers (bandits, Spartans, Athenians) look almost indistinguishable until you get close enough to either see them for yourself or use Ikaros.

I liked the inclusion of Socrates but it was frustrating that the only dialogue options you could pick were either one extreme or another, there weren't many nuanced options to work with.


But I would definitely recommend the massive game. Though I miss the spear mechanics from Origins, yo. But overall, solid, fun and beautiful. I feel like, if they keep improving on the written dialogue, their next title could be stellar.

After how bad the series has been till now, this game is a welcome change. Yes, most of the core Assassin's Creed mechanics are gone, but it's a damn good game; a proper full fledged RPG.

PROS:
- Massive, gorgeous, and rewarding to explore world.
- Beautiful graphics.
- Engaging storyline.
- Fun side quests.
- Character choice.
- Dialouge choices that affect storylines.
- Good combat and perks/abilities tree.
- A lot of customization.
- Naval element that isn't forced onto you (you can choose to barely use your ship).
- NO tail quests (thank the freaking lord).
- Malaka
- You can set your characters walking speed.
- you can change your current armors appearance so that it looks like any other armor that you've previously acquired (while keeping the stats same).

CONS:
- Microtransactions. I wouldn't mind if they were cosmetic only, but they have these "Time savers", that give you in game resources. This naturally results in them put a bit of unnecessary grind in the game to push you to buy them.
- Level gating. Another microtransaction evil. You'll eventually run into quests that are a solid 4-5 levels over you, and if you haven't till then, you'll have to do a bunch of side quests. Sadly enough, there's a permanent 1.5 times XP multiplier available as an in game purchase that prevents level gating for most of the main story line.
- Lazy enemy scaling design. Enemies level with you neck to neck, so the sense of reward is overpowered by the fact that if you don't upgrade your gear every level (or wear any other equally leveled gear), you'll always be weaker than the enemies.

Overall a well deserved 8/10

Pointless grind. Levelling takes too long. The gear takes ages to upgrade. There doesnt seem to be enough gold or resources. Looting trees in a forest is so damn boring. Searching for things in a dark cave over and over, why have this in a game. Diving on a wreck is the same, search for some useless gold and maybe a useless item I dont need. Dreading the next quest because it seems like another time waster. No more assassins creed ever.

I've played this game inside and out and if you like history and RPGs it's fine. If you love Greek History, it's great. Otherwise you don't need to play this game. Other games exist and this will not scratch a combat, stealth, fulfilling story, or graphical itch for anyone.

The Assassin’s Creed franchise has leveled up indeed in terms of quality. Odyssey is by far the most immersive in the whole series. Would recommend buying 11/10 Loved the Spartan kick feat too. To those saying negative remarks but have a potato pc, please do yourself a favor and upgrade your pc. I mean come on it's 2018; why even bother buying a tripla A game with that?
Anyway, this definitely is worth every penny you have saved for.

After 60 hours of gameplay, I'm only level 20 and having the time of my video game life. Have you ever wished you could go back in time to another era and experience what it was like? This game does that for me. I wander around ancient Greece and find bandit camps, caves, vineyards, islands, deep valleys, tall cliffs with who knows what hiding behind them. I encounter wild animals and kill them for money. Sometimes i encounter a rare one who is much more powerful and it requires me to fight tacttically in a prolonged battle where I have just as much chance to die as to live. I wander into caves and my log tells me that I haven't completed the cave 100%. I light a torch and retrace my steps looking for clues and there it is! A subtle crack in the wall that I missed earllier leading to that missing treasure. I develop skills as I level and learn to use them, then suddenly I attack a bandit camp that is too much for me. I pay some Drachmae to redo my skills and experiment and suddenly I can beat them. People in towns start getting annoyed at my intrusions, assassinations, or thefts and send bounty hunters after me. These hunters are terrifying. At first they annihilate me. I change my skills around again. It doesn't work. I change my battle strategies and suddenly I'm getting closer to beating one of them. I fine tune these strategies and finally kill one. I loot his armor. It's better than mine. I scream with joy like a madman. They send more after me. Sometimes they attack in groups. They each have unique skills . Some can kill me in just a few hits. I adopt a strategy of running and shooting my bow when I get an opening, then trying to hide and isolate one at a time. Sometimes I'm successful. Sometimes I die violently. I get a ship and start looking for pirates. The ship battles are glorious!! I fire arrows and javelins at the ships from my own ship which I constantly upgrade when I can afford it. I board their ships and we fight. I have lieutenants and a crew that I've recruited to help me. Some of them are the bounty hunters that came after me. Instead of killing them I would knock them down and recruit them at times. We kill the crew of the pirate ship and loot their chests. I get more good stuff. I get a really cool helmet. I've looted dozens of helmets, armor, and weapons. Each one looks different and they are all incredible. If I see one that I love and can't bear to replace it even after it's too many levels below me, I can go to a blacksmith and improve it. I can keep that look forever if I wish. But I don't. There are just too many suits of armor and weapons to find and choose from. I decide to head back to port and see some Spartan ships. I have no quarrel with them, but they are merchants and carry loot. I attack and loot them. Spartan are sent are sent to stop me. I kill them. I have recruited several powerful liethenants and my crew is experienced now. More of them come. Some now have mercenaries....really tough mercenaries. They sink me and kill me. I decide to take a break, le t the heat cool down, and do quests. I discover secrets about a cult, then find out that this cult is after me as well. They're as bad as the mercenaries and the bounty hunters. I fight many glorious fights against all three groups. Sometimes I win....sometimes I die. Sparta and Athens go to war. They both want me. I play both sides. Sometimes i go to war. I enter a battlefield where there are dozens of combatants. I wade through the mayhem with new armor and weapons that I looted from a merchant or found in a cave protected by bandits. The war is fast and furious Sometimes I fight three men at once. sometimes mercenaries are on the same field of battle and I must try to stay alive while being attacked from many sides. Sometimes I iwn these battles. I get rewarded with prestigious armor and weapons. I play as Kassandra. She is a warrior. One day a beautiful woman sends me on a quest. She is happy when I return successfully. I woo her. She becomes my lover. I look at my map and realize that after 60 hours I have barely scratched the surface because I keep getting distracted from the main quest. I don't care about the main quest. there's too many other things to do. A lad of the evening wants me to kill a man who robbed her. A physician needs some herbs by a stream known to attract a huge pack of wolves. There is a legendary boar that is known to have killed countless humans that needs hunted and destroyed. I have entire lists of mercenaries and Cultists that need killed, many much stronger than me. I want to recruit more lieutenants and crew for my ship....stronger ones that will take all of my skills to defeat. I need to earn more Drachmae to upgrade my ship with better archers and mayvbe a new ram. I may completely refurbish the ship into a Babylonian Galley. It will take a lot of effort to collect the Drachmae, but i have time. I'll do it after I check out this cave on the other side of this bandit camp after I kill them and get away from the mercenary that's chasing me.....

Nothing extraordinary but it's a good AC game with the addition of naval battles and huge map that's not too overwhelming thanks to the new mode you can choose called "exploration", you learn more about the world and stories as you explore and come across them organically. The world feels like Witcher's in many aspects. Performance is good but it's demanding so watch plenty of benchmark videos if you are not sure, I'm getting between 65-85 FPS on medium graphical setting. I was not rushing to finish the main story and did a lot of exploring and side quest therefore didn't notice the problem people are having with "level gating" the main quest lines.
My biggest problem with this game is the "bad port" signs like the clunky movement controls for mouse and keyboard or unexplained fps drops every once in a while.

Worth it! As you can see, I've racked up over 50 Hours so far and I can tell you this game is worth 60$. The graphics have been tweaked but are similar to Origins, the interface is also similar with some upgrades. The story is great and funny, the choice system is amazing and lets you pick what you do and dont want to do in situations. Only thing I dont like is that they killed someone I like not saying any names :). The Sea gameplay is interesting and fun. Anyways the cult is very fascinating having to find clues and hunt them down. Mercenaries are annoying but a good challenge especially on Hard. I played as Kassandra and shes just a badass anyways I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Action Adventure games. If you loved Assassins Creed III like me you can buy the Gold Edition and you'll get the remastered version free.

Okay, I am only 12+ hours into this game, but I have to say...... WOW!! This game is so much better (in my own humble opinion) than any other game in the AC series. By a long shot. Now, part of that could be the fact that I have, quite frankly, NOT been a fan of the series. Even Black Flag (that everyone seemed to adore) refused to captivate me. This game? Addicted. It is much closer to the gameplay of the Far Cry series (which is one of my favorite series ever created!) than it is the hte traditional AC games. Now, for those of you that love the AC MO, perhaps you'll be turned off a bit by this creep into a deeper RPG feel. But this review is written for that person, like me, that wants to like this series but just can't. THIS GAME is the game for me! Again, if you like the FC series, then you will LOVE this game.

So, i recommend this game cuz has parkour+assassination, but in the beginning of the game its a little hard cuz you dont have much skills. When u are around lvl 15 its more easy to kill cuz u have much more experience.
The main story line its amazing it talks about sparta and more and that rebembers me god of war and not talk about the cult of kosmos and other dlcs.
Also this game as a lot typs of skills and combat, for example swords, axes, maces, staffs, etc...
So basically i recommend u to buy this game, but buy at a promotion cuz its much more cheap.

This is a brilliant game. If you're holding off because "Assassin's Creed" or "Ubisoft", don't. This could easily have been a stand-alone title and the touches with AC are very light. Ubisoft have delivered a fantastic game and we should encourage them for that, not stick to old prejudices.

If you don't play this game, you're definitely missing out. The combat is fluid, the game mechanics are solid and all throughout the game you unlock new mechanics, new options and more gameplay. The story is solid, the world is gorgeous and expansive and it's very difficult to get bored.

Just play it.

Assassin’s Creed Origins is a dark, multifaceted, deep dive into one of the series’ most alluring settings yet: ancient Egypt. As Bayek of Siwa, who is simultaneously compassionate, bold, and driven by revenge, you’re strung through a twisted story of pharaohs and corrupt leaders, of love gained and lost, and the plights of the lower class in a time when they were routinely worked to death and nobody batted an eye. It’s a tense journey that challenges your concepts of right and wrong, making you consider the morality of those you kill in the process – and, in a dramatic shift for the series, it’s all part of a full-on roleplaying game.

I spent 30 hours finishing the main campaign, which took me through just over half of the expansive and beautiful map that recreates ancient Egypt’s varied architecture and environments. It’s filled with areas of soft sand that are swept by dynamic sandstorms, ranges of treacherous and rocky mountains, catacombs of towering ancient structures built in the names of the gods, and the decaying shacks of the common people. Refreshingly, I discovered all of these things through an organic drive to explore, rather than through the series’ traditional structure of climbing to viewpoints to have them unveiled for you. There are plenty more secrets to uncover, and the delightful sense of discovery still hasn’t left me.


This is also the biggest and most connected map we’ve seen in an Assassin's Creed game. Even the seemingly-empty desert regions having their own treats, like the breathtaking view from the highest elevation point, with an impressive draw distance, whether you’re playing on Xbox One X or PlayStation 4. There are multiple cities, too, each with their own unique culture featuring different gods, politics, race relations, and prejudices to uncover. They’re distinct in architecture and environment, and that makes the significant time commitment one that’s consistently varied and surprising.

The delightful sense of discovery still hasn’t left me.
“
The density of it is made more impressive by being able to explore it in its entirety without any loading screens, with the exception of some story cutscenes, and if you choose to fast travel. If you want to get around quickly, a smart in-universe transit system lets you call your mount and press a button to follow the main road, or to head to a custom marker you’ve placed on the map – all fully automated, letting you take in the scenery around you.

While the main story is delightfully mystical and elaborate on its own, Origins also has some of the strongest actual mission design I’ve encountered in the entire 10-game series – and maybe in any open-world RPG. From collecting clues to solve mysteries, to chariot racing and gladiatorial arena fighting, to chasing down leads and assassinating high-level enemies hidden in fortresses, to Black Flag-style ship-to-ship combat, I was pleasantly surprised by how each of them felt like a self-contained short, well-paced story. Another highlight is the series of hidden temples, which – without spoiling anything – tie into Assassin’s Creed’s overarching sci-fi story, among other things. They are distinct from every other tomb you’ll find in ancient Egypt, and even include some throwbacks to the fan-favorite, timing-based platforming puzzles introduced way back in Assassin’s Creed 2. I rarely felt like I was doing too much of any one thing.


While there are quests that simply involve finding a hidden location or looting a building, Origins has largely done away with the cluttered mini-map full of useless chests. Instead, the vast majority of quests require multiple steps to complete and have multi-faceted, interesting characters with believable motives. Even when I really only began a quest for the XP, many of them ended up distinctly memorable. I’ll remember the man who was poisoning poor Egyptians so he, as a Greek, could acquire their land when they died, and I’ll remember the little girl who was selling fake Siwan artefacts for her mother, repeatedly assuring me they were real. My sole complaint is the NPCs’ overuse of ‘my family member died!’ and Bayek’s constant outrage at someone’s disrespect of the gods as the driving force of a quest.

The most seamlessly executed parkour and climbing yet.
“
Of course, being an Assassin’s Creed game, there’s a whole lot of parkour and climbing in Origins, and this is undoubtedly Ubisoft’s most seamlessly executed version of that well-rehearsed mechanic. Things that can be climbed are blended more organically into buildings and the act of climbing feels clean and almost as passive as running. True, that removes some of the challenge that existed in previous games where you’d have to figure out the best route up a building, but it takes a fair amount of frustration out the door with it. I never had a moment where Bayek failed to climb something I thought he should be able to, and that smoothness put Ezio, Altair, and the rest of the previous Assassins to shame.

The notably strong XP-based RPG progression elements are what make Origins addictive on a new level. Assassin’s Creed has let you unlock and upgrade abilities for a while now, but Origins does it in a way that enables multiple creative options that can cater to your playstyle, rather than just things that you’ll pick arbitrarily. If you want to approach missions stealthily, there are abilities that give you bonuses for stealth kills, ones that let you control arrows in the air after you’ve fired them for more precise headshots, and ones that let you visually predict the path an enemy will walk on. If subtlety isn’t your thing, there are options that make you a beast in melee combat, others that increase the amount of money you get from looting, and some that mostly just look cool (like activating slow-mo if you’re mid-air with your bow out). In the earlier stages, there are some plainly obvious picks, but I think most people will end up with very different sets of abilities by the end of the main story.

Great game for me, best AC game since Black Flag. In my opinion Black Flag will always be the best and it'll take some beating but this one comes close. Insane amounts of depth as well I'm about 35 hours in and feel like I've barely scratched the surface. The RPG side of it is great as well. The naval combat is a huge plus as well, great fun. Totally recommend!

Huge improvement from Origins overall. The environments in particular are more stunning and beautiful than ever! I have more screenshots in this game alone than every other AC game i have combined. The combat is nice with the added skills. Climbing is still a bit clunky but still improved.

Great game, might be the best Assassin's Creed so far (haven't played Valhalla yet), at least my favorite one for sure.

It reminds me a lot of witcher 3 with some Breath of the Wild in there. Not as good dynamic systems as BOTW or as good of a story as W3 but it gets close in both aspects! The gameplay is real climby and combat is good including the assassinations, better than witcher 3. Story is almost up there with witcher 3 for me.

Only possible downside is that it might be a bit long, it took me 71h according to the game or 85h according to Steam to get to the end of the main quest and then there is lots of good story content left after that not including DLC. Keep in mind that I didn't mainline the story and I went exploring a bunch.
I'm at 90-100h in so far and I still haven't finished all the "odyssey" content that the main game offers but I'm getting there and then I still got the DLC to play.

If long games aren't what you want then maybe look elsewhere but I enjoyed it all the way.

It seems they updated this game with lots of additional content and quests after the release which I didn't know until after I beat it so

Definitely one of the well-polished games I have ever played.
Assassin's Creed Odyssey was my first open-world game that has actual combat features. I always looked forward to getting into the game as a misthios, fighting like a stylish hero, and exploring the beautiful historical environments. As a person with a huge interest in Greek mythology, I loved that there were some mythical elements in the story and mesmerized by how the environment was visualized. Strongly recommend to get DLCs as well : )

God this game was so good. If you love assasin creed orgins then u will love this. I like where assassin creeds series is going with this. Its more freely and open compared to the other creed games. Granted if you are not into hack and slash rpg games but love the stealth mechanic from the og creed games this aint for u. But damn is this game fun. Its a little grindy but it never felt to reptitive. I also had fun with the side quest and the customizing with the ship. This game is just so big that its gonna take a while to finish the story. Overall the best assassin creed game i have ever played, cant wait for the next one.

This game is completely different from past Assassin's Creed games you may have come to know.

It takes a more 'generic RPG' approach, having stats, bosses, different weapons and armor, levels and skills, and with realism thrown out the window this time.
However is it made with many well made convenience mechanics that generally improve your quality of life.
Individual side quests, lesser bounties and contracts and multiple main questlines will get you to explore the whole greek world for hours.

Yes it's very different, but I think it's a great refreshment, and an experience that you can play however you want with very little restrictions. Definitely worth buying if you are eyeing this game during whatever sale there is that brought you here.

This is not an Assassin's Creed game, that's obvious. But if you want an experience with lots of story and action, and some RPG elements; this is your game. Play it, you will at least spend 50 hours of your life and it will worth it.

Overall, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a great game.

The historical time period is extremely fun and the level progression within the game itself makes you feel like a Greek demigod after awhile. At the moment of writing, I'm 200 hours in and I still haven't finished the main quest-line or explored every side-quest and region. The Greek world is beautiful and, much like Odysseus, you can spend a great deal of time lost in it, just running and sailing around. The RPG and mythological infusions were a strange, but welcome, change of pace from previous Assassin's Creeds. Likewise, I've enjoyed the new, Shadow of Mordor-like mercenary system, which adds a new challenge when several mercenaries are stalking you at once. In my opinion, the writing is better than in Origins and I've found Kassandra (I have not played as Alexios yet) to be a more likeable character than Bayek. I have found myself laughing hard at several quests. (In particular, the "You killed mater and had sex with pater!" quest.) I love being able to choose my own character and Kassandra, like Evie Frye, is a welcome addition to the playable female assassin roster. At first, I disliked the combat system but I've grown ambivalent about it now. Still not a fan of enemies harmlessly passing through you when you're on a ladder though.

To be honest, this is probably one of my favorite Assassin's Creeds, after Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood. Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for Ubisoft to take Assassin's Creed to feudal Japan or China...

This is the first Assassin's Creed game i have played & at time of writing this 68 hours of gameplay
First off I play Max visual settings 2560 x 1440 @144hz
Game sits Around 65 fps never had any game issues runs smooth
Story line fantastic ! it kinda reminds me of Titans Quest but Ubisoft have pumped it full of steroids .
I have already setup Assassin's Creed Origin anticipating this game finishing only to learn I have only finished 45%
Very engrossing game beware

Well I what a journey that was 245 hours to complete every achievement & every mission
The Story through was excellent

I couldn't stand the Assassin's Creed franchise. That is, un till now!

I honestly haven't played Assassin's Creed in a long LONG time, I couldn't stand the gameplay before, albeit yes I haven't sampled Origins (which I hear is also on par with Odyssey) but when I saw this game in my discovery queue I almost hit "Ignore" like I would with any previous Assassin's Creed. But the genre caught my eye, Greece? Greek gods? The scenary, the whole Greek theme really caught my eye, I love this sort of genre. I stuck it on my wishlist, I watched a few trailers a few youtube videos and decided to buy it once it came down in price in the winter sale and boy am I glad I did!

I remember Assassin's creed back in the day, the whole blending in rubbish, the genres were terrible, the look didnt catch my eye, the whole "historic" look back in like 1800's blah blah I didn't like it but Odyssey is fantastic. The look of the game is mind blowing to say the least, I haven't expereinced any horrible screen tearing, or annoying scenic pop ins, everything is unbelievably smooth and that's only the tip of the iceberg.

It plays great, the sword fights are epic, the assassinations are beautful and brutal in equal measure, the use of the Eagle is so damn good to scout out the area your approaching, you mark your targets and areas of interest using the eagle so you can plot your moves. It's a game of strategy before you even enter the area in question, sure you can go in gung ho, sure why not but there's something in scouting the area with your eagle and taking enemies out systematically, one by one, silently, deadly and tossing their bodies out of sight. That's my preference but you can play how you like.

The skill tree is easy to manage and to understand, nothing is over complicated when it doesn't need to be, you skill up, spend ability points in the tree on whichever playstyle suits you. Do you prefer bows? Then add the ability to suit, prefer Sword fights? then add the ability to suit etc etc.

The variety of weapons I've seen, even in the first few hours of gameplay are fantastic, didn't take me long to look like a typical sandal wearing noob to having nice shiny mercenary armour and even upgraded them at the blacksmith using ores and materials i found on my travels.

Everything seems worth it and that's a huge plus for me, I've found myself in the last few hours just doing a few side quests in Sala (The first town you're in) just to boost my Xp and generally hone my skills and they're great, meaningful side quests with nice lore and decent story telling.

The voice acting is really good too, sometimes in games the voice acting and the mouth movements are terrible but not here, looks and sounds great.

It's also not easy btw, I've been playing on normal and i've died quite a few times but usually more so because of my own stupidity and trying to blast thru a quest, be patient, be smart and the game will reward you.

Everything from graphics, gameplay, Xp, weapon types and upgrades, the general look and feel, the genre, everything is a 10/10.

A solid 10/10 If I had 1 gripe it's that there's no shields......... I find that a little bizarre considering the genre but meh, it's not affecting my fun or gameplay it's just something i'd have liked.

Oh and I climbed up Zeus's statue and hung from his balls........ So there's that.

10/10

Although the game starts off as fun to play, you tend to repeat the same actions over and over and it feels like a grind to get through the story. It feels like a slightly better looking version of Origins. Some improvements were made to the skills tree, but it's still the same model where you have to grind your level up to play certain story missions.

Additionally, this game markets itself as being "Assassin's Creed", this is nothing further from the truth. The game has no links to the series' story line, the only possible link can be associated with artifacts. It has no assassin nature nor does it connect to the templars in any sense. It seems that Ubisoft focused so much on making an RPG style game they forgot to connect the game to its roots.

Everyone will find a way to have fun in this game, I just don't think that your entertainment value will last. It will slowly turn into the feeling of a grind that tires you out from even wanting to play the story.

The game has textures improvements, now you can vault objects by holding C while you're running. The Story is long and tedious every character has an excuse to make you go fetch some stuff to go on, this makes the game boring to play and push you to spend real money in Exp boost this is a wrong move for Ubisoft, also the world is huge the AI of the Guards is improved and they will be really hard to face even at the higher levels and i see this as an improvement from Odyssey. I saw some glitches and bugs but they are all related to the terrain and you can find people stuck in it. The hystoric characters are well made they have a good personality and well characterized.

The game changed a lot since previous chapter, now its a true GDR with choices. Also important choices are all Kill/save and i would prefer a more open choice system like on Skyrim. You can romance many characters males and females but there are not sex scenes.

The Game becomes an Assassin's Creed after the main story, with pieces of the eden to find and Layla trying to find Atlantis. Mythological creatures are beautiful to fight like in Origins.

In the next game i expect a game with a better story and a better character. If you are new on the Assassin's Creed Saga skip this one and play "Origins" and what comes next. The Lore in this game focus on the ancient civilization temples.

My thoughs about this game

It's a well made game, I always loved the Assassin's Creed Series but this one feels so smooth and chilll love it
if u still wanna have a Singleplayer Open-World game than i would legit say buy it. already clocked 24hours in the game and i still can't stop playing it! so i would say
It's super worth it...

Reason why it's worth it?
Story is good
Gameplay is Chill/Smooth
Old Backstabs
a lot of MURDER OFC LMFAO

Minus points:

Microtransactions even if u bought the Ultimate pack kinda sad but alright nothing necessary

EDIT: So far i have completed the main story and just trying to do all the side missions etc etc, still loving it

It truly depends on what you are looking for. The graphics and environment are really good however the only thing that really make me loose immertion at least to me can be seem as picky. And it goes to mostly the lack of connection that can be had witht he game as there is not really anything to fight for and your action do not really have any matter or consequence in a Holistic way. Everything happens one way or another around you and there is nothing you can really do. And everything feels really repetitive once you find the pattern on all the quests. So If you like combat and the looks you'll probably love this game, however if you are into story telling and engagin mechanism, this is probably not for you.

This game has an exceptional story by far and yes, it is difficult to level up and will force you to take part in the side quests. I am not a fan of "TIME SAVERS"(ffs) IF YA WANT TO SAVE TIME DONT PLAY THE GAME I would have been let down if the side quests were garbage, but they really are not. It can easily go past 50hrs of gameplay.
PS.
The game is very hardware dependant so scaling down resolution helps.

The only thing that reminds you this game belongs to the Assassin's Creed franchise is the menu music and the generic noises of the interface and loading screens.

Additional note:
Just bought the game the other day. I started playing AC on the realise of Assassin Creed 2 over a decade ago. I stopped playing Assassin's Creed after Syndicate. Game doesn't feel like Assassin Creed but rather a Witcher 3 rip off. Isn't terrible so far and thus, I shall give thumbs up.

Edit: I am changing my review of this game "would recommend", as the developer, Ubisoft, made good on their promise to include support for older CPUs. They said the issue would be resolved by next patch, and I just logged in to find a new patch and voila, the game is playable. My settings are admittadly a mixture of low and medium but the game has not crashed once and is fairly smooth at around 40-50+ FPS consistently.

I would like to thank the Ubisoft developers for taking the time to resolve this issue. It was hard not to feel dismissed, as developers of other games have done in the past in similar circumstances. Ubisoft actually listened to their player base, and found that a quick fix could and would allow even more people the chance to buy and enjoy the game.

They deserve respect and kind words for a decently quick turnaround. While I would have loved to see the game released in this state, I understand that it can be difficult to know what percentage of people will still be affected and by what problems when a new game is released.

I'm going to leave the previous "would not recommend" review underneath for transparency even after changing it to "would recommend", but I am happy to report I've been playing the game with no issues and am looking forward to enjoying a hundred hours in what already feels like the best Assassin's Creed game to date.

Again, thank you to the Ubisoft developers for resolving this quickly. Thank you to "ubiunicorn" for a quick response, and the hard work to include a smaller but vocal group of gamers to the supported hardware. My faith in your company and your support staff has been restored.
-------------------------------

My hardware met the system requirements, and I have not been unable to play any other game previously. Issues with first generation intel CPUs (which benchmark comparable to later generations) make the game unloadable and crash at the start. Ubisoft has blamed the users for having out of date hardware, even though the same hardware runs AC: Origins, and any other game on the market right now.

The issue seems to be with first gen CPUs not supporting AVX. Previous game titles have set this as a requirement and later patched the requirement out, allowing those first gen CPUs to run the game. After more than a week of forum complaints from gamers who play every other game with no issues, Ubisoft finally realized it could no longer blame the user, and agreed to patch the previously unmentioned requirement out in the next patch. No news whether that will fix the issues for everyone, but if you buy this game (which I've heard is wonderful) be prepared for the game to crash at startup. Be prepared to spend much of your own time troubleshooting why this AAA title wont run despite meeting the initial system requirements. Plenty of gamers playing every other title out right now have had to return the game for a refund and wait to see if the AVX issues patching fixes most of the crashes.

Hoping one day soon, I can edit this review after actually being able to play the game, but for now it's put a bad taste in my mouth regarding Ubisoft. They are currently in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with EA for dismissing a good chunk of their player base and then blaming the user for the issue while they scramble to resolve it behind closed doors.

As a newcomer in the Assassin's creed's universe, i must say that i'm really happy to have bought this game! It's a wonderful exploration/action adventure. The only downside is trying to find the good settings to remove the stuttering. For me, it was using vertical sync and locking the fps to 55. It completely removed the stuttering and the game was fully playable. I still recommend this game for anyone looking for a good action adventure game!

It isn't a traditional Assassin's Creed. But it does have a ton of stuff to do (which can feel repetitive at times). Buy it on sale if you can.

The last AC game I played was Syndicate; I skipped Origins because the Egyptian setting didn't appeal to me. I bought Odyssey based on the positive feedback I got from some of my friends who weren't traditionally AC fans; hence, this was my first time to try the series' new RPG-esque mechanics, and I was quite frankly blown away.

This game is legit, folks: it doesn't have quest scripting on the same level as the Witcher III, but it knows how to keep your attention and is very competent at most everything it does. Kassandra is also the most appealing AC protagonist we've had in a good while. I'm far from done with the game, but I'm very happy with what I've played so far.

Despite the previous heated internet discussions over ACO's speed leveling mechanics, I'm happy to report I didn't even notice it was there - they're certainly not pushing it in any overly gauche way, to the point that even if you put a gun to my head I honestly couldn't tell you how to buy this speed boosting thing everyone was talking about in-game.

Probably my favorite purchase from all the games I bought in the Autumn sale. Highly recommended!

Assassin's Creed turned RPG is what Odyssey truly is. You can still run around and assassinate people, but you have to level up your character and the various abilities in order to be an effective assassin. Overall, I loved this game. I've completed the main story and all of the DLCs. To me it was worth the purchase because I enjoy the Assassin's Creed games, and this one was no different, even though it's not your typical AC game like the ones from the beginning through Black Flag. The story is good, the weapons are fun to use, and the fights are challenging since the enemies usually scale up to a level closer to yours as you progress. I would recommend this game if you want a game that has a good enough story with a lot of action, running around discovering the various areas, and fighting different types of enemies.

SPOILER-FREE REVIEW

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the second instalment in the RPG trilogy after Assassin's Creed Origins and before Assassin's Creed Valhalla. The game takes up a lot of mechanics from the previous instalment, and works upon them while also introducing more. The game is set in the setting of Ancient Greece (431-432 BC), right after The Peloponnesian War. As a student of Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India, we, students of the Game Development branch were made to post a detailed review of a game of our choice on a public platform as an activity, and this will be an in-depth review of the controversial 2018 RPG instalment of Assassin's Creed.


CONCEPT

This action role-playing game offers players a branched, varied and vast open world experience with one of the biggest game worlds of all time. The game directly inherits RPG elements from The Witcher 3 and other hits in the genre, and tosses them into a mix with classic Assassin's Creed ones (or at least some of them). With the side quests included, the game is sure to keep you hooked for over a 100 hours, and that is just the base game without any DLC.


PARADIGM

How does the game allow a player to reach their goal?
✔️PROS:
Odyssey features an extensive campaign that is branched into 3 main odysseys, one of which, offers more than 8 endings in itself. The game is tailored by the choices the player makes. It makes sure that if you have reached from point A to B in the game in a certain way, it will be totally different from the method taken up by somebody else. This calls for a lot of memorable experiences and varied narratives.

❌CONS:
The game can easily feel bloated at times. The quantity over quality scheme becomes transparent when the player is faced with lazily-written side quests, boring story arcs and just a slow-paced narrative in general.


FEATURES

◘ Amazingly stunning graphics.
◘ An extensive story campaign sure to keep you occupied for hours.
◘ A massive open-world. Bigger than any you might have ever seen.
◘ Easy to master combat.
◘ A mercenary system which was most likely inspired by the nemesis system in Middle Earth: Shadow of War.
◘ A ship-crew building system that allows you to recruit any mercenary of your choice thrown in with tons of naval adventures.

◘ A weekly reset feature that rewards you with exclusive items for simply playing the game.


MECHANICS

A densely integrated RPG system
✔️PROS:
Assassin's Creed is no stranger to RPG elements. The game takes up all the memorable elements from Origins, and works upon them to make them even more fitting for this instalment, be it the levelling and XP system, the weapon rarities with overpowered legendary weapons that you can find by digging around here and there or even the multiple dialogue options. You can even choose the gender you want to play as. The game offers its players a moral compass this time around. You can choose to be violent and harsh, you can choose to be a trickster and lie your way out, or you can even choose to simply romance through it all. Every player is ensured to have different stories to tell.

❌CONS:
How much RPG is too much RPG? The number of choices thrown at you CAN feel a bit too much at one point. Often, you may find yourself wishing for a more linear experience than having to pause your game everytime you find another sword with a higher rarity.

The Mercenary/Bounty System
✔️PROS:
What seems to have been a direct nod to the Nemesis system fro Middle Earth: Shadow of War, is the exclusive feature to the second instalment of this RPG trilogy. Players can hack and slash their way to the top of the mercenary chain as they progress in the game. These are usually randomly generated, but there are also a lot of memorable ones, each with their own traits and skillsets, ensuring that you switch up your strategy everytime you encounter a new one.

❌CONS:
The mercenary system can easily become a pain in your normal play routine. If you have a high bounty on your head, you'll have mercenaries pouring all over you even when you're just trying to relax and have fun. This seems challenging at first, but can become a nuisance later on when all you're trying to do is just progress in the story.


INTERFACE

Most of the interface is directly borrowed from Assassin's Creed Origins. However, this time around it has been a bit simplified. The skill tree branches out to three main areas - Warrior, Hunter and Assassin, each of which have their own specific skills designed for their own specific situations. The inventory screen has also received a major overhaul, giving players a proper preview of the gear they would want to equip. The map is detailed, and offers pointers wherever you need them. Overall, the game does a good job of making sure you're not lost.



FINAL VERDICT
My personal rating for the game would be a solid 8/10
Although the game seems to have strayed away from the classic Assassin's Creed formula, it has made sure to keep you hooked for over a course of several hours. The RPG mechanics are not exactly polished and could've been less bloated, but they offer you a branched playstyle. The game also seems to perform pretty well on most modern machines, although there may be a little frame drops here and there and especially in largely populated places. Overall, the game is a solid successor to Origins and a ton of fun to play.
