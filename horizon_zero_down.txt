Spoiler-free review.

Technical
Finally a console ported game worth buying on pc - in three playthroughs I've only run into two crashes and a couple of glitches here and there. The game's well polished and not the buggy mess, I've come to expect by now, when going for AAA games. I suppose it helps, that the game has been out on console for ages now and yes, also running top end hardware. Nevertheless I'm usually very sceptical when it comes to ported games. Hence: BRAVO.

Story
Complemented with the soundtrack and visuals, the story was absolutely breathtaking. Been a long time I invested emotionally into a game. Give them writers a raise :) Even on third playthrough I still had shivers running down my back on some scenes.

Gameplay
The (story) missions themselves are pretty linear, with some hidden side rooms, if you want to explore and get some background infos to the lore/history. The map is, after a first/short walled of segment, open. Side missions and objectives scattered all over the place. Its left up to the player, how he wants to deal with the world. You ain't forced into specific areas and not even forced to complete every side quest. Overall you can get around 80 hours of gameplay, if you want to collect all, listen to all datapoints and so on. If you just focus on the main-missions, I estimate it'll last 40+ hrs ez.

Price
Well worth the 60 bucks on pc.

Addendum
I don't expect Sony's gonna read this, but just in case: This game was one of my favorite games this year. I'd even hand over more of my hard earned $$$ for quality products like this. I will not buy a console however, just to get access to exclusive games - even if they all as good as this one (looking at you there "God of War" or "The Last of us"). So why don't you do us all, and frankly yourself, the favor and learn from this - ease up on exclusives and seize the potential cash cow that is pc gamers ;)

THE IDEAL OPEN WORLD GAME

What could have been better:

Optimization:
• Its kinda iffy still. It took me a while to get the perfect settings. There's a pretty big dip in fps on everything on high or ultra at certain areas. So i put everything at medium to high and everything was smooth. (My specs - Ryzen 5 3600, GTX 1660 super, 16GB RAM)
• Also there's something wrong with the anti-aliasing, its noticeable on certain sections of the map with a lot of foliage.
• I had 2 hard crash and it was in the last mission, but it was just after a save so i didn't mind that much.
• Sometimes when you launch the game it says "Optimizing Shaders" in the main menu (it takes about 3-4 min) if you don't wait it do its thing, its gonna be laggy as hell.
• About 3-4 times the weather just completely changed in a instant for no reason.

Lip syncing / Conversation cut scene / Facial Animation:
• All these are a hit or miss. Most times its really good, but other times its distracting or funny.

Audio logs:
• Hear me out. I love the audio logs in this game, the're very well voice acted and I've listened to almost all of them. They are the one of the major sources for world building and is used heavily throughout the game. But when you put me in a room with 5-6 audio logs, each of which is 1 min long it forced me to stand there and listen to each one. I know you can listen to them later but most use the area where it was scanned to tell the story. At least I would have liked these audio logs to be spread around so I could at least go from point A to B listening to it.

Spoiler:



WHY ITS SO GOOD:

Aloy:
• I really like her. Character design wise and how shes written. What I love is that she's not perfect. She has selfish goals and at times act childish just like any real person.
• But she's also strong and independent and isn't afraid of calling people out. (I especially love it when she calls people for being sexist, its hilarious)
• Alloy strikes a good balance between being strong but vulnerable.

The World:
• Probably one of the most unique open worlds I have explored. Every new location had me in awe to see this future where nature and machine co exist.
• It is of perfect size with lots of verticality which I really enjoyed.
• You can see the remains of the old ones while exploring like old tanks, buildings and so much more which creates this immersive world where your intrigued to know what happened there.
• Also it has almost no loading screen, except a few areas, but its amazing considering the size and details of the world.

The Story:
• I loved the story. Its such a breadth of fresh air.
• It has a pretty slow start (The first 5 hour or so was pretty slow, but after "The Proving" sh*t gets real, real fast).
• The lore was interesting and made me wanted to know more about this weird world.
• Overall the writing is solid. The way the characters interacts with each other, alloys random one liners etc were all a treat and genuinely got a few chuckles out of me.

ENEMIES:
• HOLY SH*T ITS AMAZING. ITS ANIMALS BUT MACHINES!! Such a simple concept but done with such elegance.
• There were quite a few surprises along the way with made my JAW drop ;)
• The audio queue for each machine is distinct and clearly understandable even when they' are off screen.
• Also the dismemberment is oh so satisfying and looks freaking cool.

Side Quests:
• There aren't a lot which is actually a big plus. I would have hated if they went with the ubisoft copy past missions.
• But here there are a few and most are amazing with unique and interesting motive like in the witcher 3 but less in number.

NPC:
• Every single NPC is interesting and has their own opinion, believe and motive. Everyone won't accept you even if you prove yourself which is great because some people are just d*icks, and the game doesn't change that.

The Combat:
• It will seem pretty basic at first, but it builds on those concepts and makes a system that all feels cohesive together. Whatever load out you carry, everything synergies really well.
• The game has a good combat loop
• Even after maxing out everything and having good gear the game was pretty challenging which is a plus.

Costume Design:
• I have to praise this. Its amazing! Everything Alloy and the other main characters wear are so aesthetically pleasing and appropriate to the respective tribes.
• Each tribe's believes and customs are visible from what they wear.

Photo Mode:
• I have to put this here, I'm a big sucker for virtually photography and this game was a treat. Every single location looks stunning and the photo mode was the icing on top. *mwah*

DLC - The Frozen Wilds:

• Shout out to the amazing snow physics in this section
• Also most of the issues I had with the main game are greatly improved here, so they are going in the right direction.

Misc:
• Thank you Guerrilla games for not charging full price for the port.
• Thank you Sony for finally bringing this to PC (please bring more)

HYPED FOR HZD: FORBIDDEN WEST !! WO-WO !!

P.S: Thank you Xena for gifting this on my birthday! I finally get it why this is one of your favourite games. It was a treat to play through this.

P.P.S : I might have went a little overboard with this review, I should have just posted "yes", oh well.

OVERVIEW ↴
Horizon Zero Dawn is a third person/single player action game set in post-apocalyptic land ruled by mechanical creatures, in which the remains of humanity are split into warring tribes and kingdoms that dwell among the ruins of ancient times. And so here we are, in a regressed to a primitive state Earth, where we take on a role of a young huntress, an outcast of the Nora tribe, Aloy, who's forced by a series of events to go on a journey to not only uncover her past but also the origins of the world she currently lives in therefore the fall of the previous civilization.

GRAPHICS AND AUDIO ↴
People can say a lot of different things about this game but we can all agree that as funny as it sounds, an apocalypse was never more beautiful and so visually stunning as it is in HZD which results in it being an absolute design masterpiece. I know, who would have thought.. Okay, I'm not kidding. The graphics alone can blow your mind. Sure, there are some tiny buggy things you can notice if you try hard enough (and you're a screenshot hoe) but it still doesn't diminish the fact that this apocalyptic world is simply breathtaking. From the lush and seemingly alive forests of Sacred Lands amongst the rippling of shining creeks and endlessly flowing rivers where sunlight strikes and glints on the gliding surface to the incredibly detailed snowy mountains from the great plateau to the captivating contrast between the days and nights which brings in a truly otherworldly lighting effects to this extraordinary environment.. Add now to this immersive graphics, an also impressive sound design which let's you with it's combination of flowing/soothing instrumental beats and mechanic sounds, draw you into a prehistoric yet futuristic life on Zero Dawn's Earth.

GAMEPLAY ↴
The most pleasant surprise to me was how fluid and fun the gameplay actually is and beacuse of this, it simply went beyond my expectations. You've got an open world were exploration is always good and any kind of combat, whatever it be with machines, animals or humans is extremely rewarding but progressivly gets tougher the longer you get into the storyline which in itself is a pretty cool aspect. The mechanics of the combat are basically giving us a healthy challange in which we cannot always relay on one weapon through the whole game and makes us realize that it's sometimes best to switch your fighting style between stealh and full head-on attacks or just simply figure out each machine's attack pattern, capabilities and weaknesses to get a successful outcome without failing in the process or worse dying. Plus the fact that we can only save our progress in a campfire makes it all more exciting even if a bit cumbersome at times. The only thing that could deserve a criticism in this interesting game style would probably be the melee combat that feels like it has been added last minute as an afterthought from the devs to balance the heavy push on the player to use a long range combat instead.

STORY ↴
We're set to immerse ourselves in a bit of self discovery mission for the main protagonist in this bizzare new world, all while trying to also uncover the truths about this strange corruption that's plaguing machines and wreaking havoc among Earth's remaining population. It's an exciting journey from the very start that leaves us with lots of interesting questions to the end where most of them are finally answered; it's filled with enough twists and turns to make it fun and immersive for any player dubbing themselves an RPG ethusiast. And to add a cherry on the top, the game offers us a large amount of side-missions, collectibles and challenges around the world to complete that in turn makes us stronger, thanks to a very generous XP and item rewards which doesn't leaves us with the impression of grinding for futher progress. Truly, a pretty well written story with a good dose of mystery to make the player enjoy and especially want to slowly piece together what happened to the Ancient Ones and the impacts of theirs decisions on the current state of Aloy's world but foremost what it means for her future. Ps. The atmposphere in this game is to die for, lol.

PERFORMANCE, BUGS AND GLITCHES ↴
Ughh, there was the common problem that comes with a console games ported to pc which is the optimization. It was a bit of a problem since it resulted in lots of visual glitches, pretty low fps and some crashes that I've gotten to experience a lot when I started playing the game. But I can honestly say that since the last patch 1.06 HZD is running as smoothly as possible on my medium/high settings so I don't think anyone should have problems with running the game as it is right now 'cause it performs exceptionally well... But if you still get some crashes, it might help if you run the game .exe as admin instead of booting it up straight from steam and maybe putting the graphics on medium/low to balance the fact that this game loves to eat up players CPU like it's candy, no matter if you reach the minimum or high specs... I won't say anything about the camera having a mind of its own 'cause I truly didn't had any problems with it, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

CONCLUSION ↴
Horizon Zero Dawn: To hate it or to love it? In my opinion... love it. It's an amazing open world action game and a real treat that will give you a lot of hours to explore the vast and enchanting world of Zero Dawn with it's dangerous machines, and maybe not groundbreaking but very interesting storyline to follow; an absolute must play for action game fans that want an exciting journey to keep them at the edge of theirs seats with some of the best visuals available in gaming period.

I was apprehensive to get this game initially on launch because I heard about it crashing/bugs etc on PC. I would highly recommend anyone who loves RPGs to get this game now. I haven't had any issues with this game with over 50 hours played and it is easily one of the best open world games I have ever played. The combat is amazingly satisfying and the game is absolutely gorgeous. If anyone reading this is considering buying it I would say stop wavering and purchase it. It is totally worth it and you will be amazed by the world you experience. I would put it in my top 5 favorite games of all time.

♦️ Horizon Zero Dawn
Horizon Zero Dawn is one of Sony’s few first party IPs to make its way to PC and the Steam platform. For years throughout the Ps4s lifecycle we heard critics and fans alike rave about Horizon and what an experience it is. Now we get to test their claims at a high resolution with unlocked framerates.

Story & Characters
Narrative
→ Horizon starts off by giving us a taste at this strange new world. The feelings of excitement and awe during my first couple hours were at an all time high. Part of the story is fully grasping and immersing yourself in Horizons bizarre world. The narrative is a relatively basic one, and takes a little while to get up to speed. But once it does get the ball rolling it really starts laying the real truth behind Aloys past and how this future of Earth came to be.
→ Aloy is on a mission to find out her true purpose, all while this strange corruption is plaguing machines and wreaking havoc among Earth's remaining population.I won’t go into detail but the second half of the game really starts answering questions about the truth of this world. Horizon’s story is a really exciting journey from start to finish, filled with enough twists and turns to keep you at the edge of your seat.

Characters
→ Through the roughly ~40 hour campaign you will learn with Aloy about her past and fall in love with her as a person. Aloy is an amazing protagonist who reacts believably to shocking events. And through the journey you will come across supporting characters some good, some bad, some outright mysterious. Each and every one of them play a big role one way or another to progression Aloy to her goals. All have their own personal goals and missions with a unique personality

Rost a lovable father figure, who will do whatever it takes to protect and help Aloy. 
A Screenshot of Horizon Zero Dawn

Gameplay
Combat
→ The main form of fighting off these ferocious machines is through meleeing with your spear or shooting one of dozens of projectiles. Aloys hits make an impacting clash as her weapons clang off monstrous machines. And retreating back with a bow is always a viable strategy if that is more your jist. If you want an idea of how the combat plays it’s similar to how Monster Hunter: World feels, where you must use all tools at your disposal to take down gigantic beasts. The machines attacked are heavily choreographed and require you to learn attack patterns for almost every machine. And pressing ‘v’ to turn on your focus will highlight weak points and show weaknesses for whichever machine you highlight. This turns combat into this fast paced in and out game where you strike with your spear, dodge, and try to fire at its weak points with your bow.
→ Aloy also has a roll to dodge enemy attacks which is difficult to master but is necessary to take on some of the biggest machines: There is also a stealth option to get the first strike on unsuspecting machines, and useful for taking out camps of humanoids Metal Gear Solid style.

Difficulty
→ Horizon offers six different difficulty settings ranging from ‘Story’ to ‘Ultra Hard’ depending if you just want to focus on the story or if you want to stay awake at night in fear of saw-toothed robotic pumas. I played on ‘normal’ and I feel it gave a great experience, where combat was hard enough to make me focus but wasn’t easy enough to zone out and just wait for the next cutscene to play.

Weapons & Tools
→ You have your usual bow, bigger bow, and spear but unique weapons like the tripcaster, sling, or rope gun. Your bow can of course be equipped with many different status ailments for use depending on the enemies weakness. This can be from fire arrows to armor piercing ones. And the tripcaster can lay status ailment lines that cause damage when enemies walk through them. The ropecaster can pin enemies to the ground leaving them vulnerable to heavy damage. Horizon offers many types of enemies to battle with more than enough different ways to defeat them, and no option is more right than any other.

Stealth is quite a viable play style in Horizon. Using distractions and a sharp spear you can methodically take out packs of enemies. 
A Screenshot of Horizon Zero Dawn

Upgrades
→ Throughout your journey you will come across merchants that will trade you new armors and weapons in return for your resources. This provides incentive to kill machines to get all their drops as many machines provide an individual ‘currency’ to trade for unique armors and weapons. You’re also given the option to craft upgrades to your ammo pouches, carrying capacity on health potions. Etc. Meanwhile you will get modifications from defeated enemies that can be slotted in your armor and weapons for powerful buffs. This can be from +armor piercing to better handling.

Skills
→ Not only are you tailoring your gear and weapons best suited for your playstyle, you also gain skill points on leveling up to enhance certain aspects of Aloy. If you want to rely heavily on your bow then upgrade its ‘slow-mo’ time and learn how to fire three arrows at once. If you want to be up close and personal enhance your weapon damage with deadly finisher attacks.

Enemy Design
→ One of Horizons many eye catching design choices, is of course the various machines you will encounter. I can say that each machine fights differently with their own fighting styles. With over twenty plus different enemies you will encounter, each being as thrilling as the other. Think of each enemy as a sort of Dark Souls (Are we still comparing games to Dark Souls in 2020?) boss where they each have an attack pattern to learn and large attacks to avoid.

Side Content
→ Besides the main story there is a load of side content to get lost in. From interesting side missions with their own little arc and of course uninteresting fetch quests. Also including exploring ‘ruins’ to gain important knowledge on certain enemy types. It even has timed trials if that is more of your thing. Most importantly Horizon on PC comes with a whole extra fifteen hours of story in the form of its expansion “Frozen Wilds”.

Visuals & Sound
Visuals
→ The world design rivals Red Dead 2s visual quality. Filled with high quality textures with an amazing day/night cycle that brings in otherworldly lighting effects. There were many points across my playthrough where I had to take a good minute and pause in photo mode to admire the visual fidelity offered by Gorilla Games. I will say that at the launch of Horizon on PC performance was quite rocky and my 1080ti struggled to get playable frame rates and constantly crash. But I have played Horizon recently with my 1080ti and I will say the many patches made, it is finally at a really acceptable level of port quality.

Sound
→ To accompany the amazing visual design there is also an impressive sound design. Each enemy sounds viscous in its own right, their attacks crack with explosions and really sound scary. And on the opposite end there is blissful music that pairs perfectly with Horizons stunning vistas. The music is a combination of free flowing beats with robotic sounds spiking at times, it really sells this prehistoric yet futuristic world of Horizon Zero Dawn.

From highly detailed mountain ranges to the harshest snowfalls. Horizon Zero Dawn offers a variety of detailed environments.

♦️ Conclusion
In conclusion Horizon Zero Dawn mostly lives up to the hype of a first party Playstation exclusive. Now nothing was groundbreaking, but it offers an above average narrative mixed with tense combat against monstrous machines, and some of the best visuals available in gaming period. It is truly a must play for anyone with a capable machine and no doubt worth its price, especially on sale!
Overall Score 8.5/10

The sun came up over a mountain as I was looking up to scout out some glinthawks. I literally raised my hand to my forehead in real life in an attempt to block the sun's rays. That's how immersive this game is. Or how dumb I am. Either way, you should buy this game. One of my favorite single-player open-world experiences ever.

Intro
(100% Spoiler-Free Review)
Horizon Zero Dawn (HZD) is an open-world action-adventure game with a post apocalyptic setting. After a great catastrophe, humanity was nearly wiped out and regressed to a primitive state, as nations have been replaced by warring tribes and kingdoms. Survivors dwell among the ruins of ancient times, populated by animal-like machines that threaten human life daily. Players impersonate Aloy, a tribe outcast fostered by Rost, who found and cared for her since infancy. A series of events forces her to embark on a quest of legendary proportions, destined to change the world.

🟩 The Good Side
The Apocalypse never was more beautiful
Visually and more importantly artistically, HZD is an absolute masterpiece. Aside from the incredibly detailed graphics, spectacular vistas and scrumptious light effects, the art direction behind each NPC, machine and environment is truly one of the best I've ever seen in 22 years of gaming. The care and research behind each animation, location, animal, plant and just about anything else is phenomenal. The world always feels vibrant, alive thanks to dynamic weather and independent NPCs going about their business as time passes.

Thrill of the Hunt
This game emphasizes like no other the concepts of preparation and knowing one's enemy. Each adversary, be it machine or human, has different attack patterns and weaknesses to exploit - that may as well change as the battle progresses. Resource gathering and crafting play a vital role in Aloy's journey against more and more dangerous foes: picking her fights wisely and using the correct tool for the job among the many available will be key to victory. Skill and preparation are equally rewarded in a combat system that always feels challenging and satisfactory.

Everything has a meaning
HZD offers a large amount of side-quests, collectibles and challenges around the world for Aloy to complete and in turn become stronger, thanks to generous XP and item rewards. Not only that, but such missions often unlock unique weapons, gear pieces or other quests, while even collectibles offer special rewards if entire "sets" of them are found in the world. Certain missions may even influence the endgame parts, as some secondary characters may ally or abandon Aloy depending on her actions. Every single side activity is worth doing, varied and rewarding.

The complete journey
This PC port of HZD includes all DLC ever released, as well as the Frozen Wilds expansion which offers much greater challenge, and the Ultra Hard difficulty setting for NG and NG+ modes - which brings a masochistic level of brutality. Along with visual improvements compared to console, this is really the best version of this title one could possibly hope to play. Porting issues have been fixed since release, and the game runs brilliantly now.


Visually, HZD is out of this world tier. Seriously. However, such beauty comes at a high price in terms of hardware resources.

🟥 The Bad Side
404: bad sides not found
I couldn't think of any bad sides worth mentioning for HZD. That's the first time in 10 years of writing reviews this has ever happened. Any flaw the game has is at worst minor and is not nearly severe enough to mention as a standalone issue. Well played Guerrilla Games, well played indeed.

It took me around 60 hours to complete the main story, Frozen Wilds DLC and all side activities everywhere on Very Hard difficulty. For the price of 50€ and exceptional quality, I can recommend buying this game for full price.

Melee, ranged, stealth or traps are all viable approaches to any fight. Whatever one may choose, combat is always exciting.

In-Depth Breakdown
🎮 Gameplay Analysis
Gameplay is divided into Exploration, Combat, Quests and Character Management.

Exploration
Is initially performed on foot, while later on also by mounting certain machine types once able to do so. The world is immense, but thankfully dotted with Campfires acting as fast-travel points, that however costs Travel Packs to enable - more based on larger distances. While initially limited, the map becomes soon fully explorable, with each biome housing diverse machines, some far too dangerous initially. Quests, collectibles, challenges and lore entries are scattered evenly throughout, making exploration of each corner rewarding and interesting. New quests and important locations are automatically highlighted once found, as well.

Combat
Is the core of HZD's gameplay, and is based mainly on knowing each machine's attack pattern, capabilities and weaknesses to succeed. Timing dodge-rolls well, laying out traps before starting a fight, and having a steady aim are equally important factors in surviving attacks that, on high difficulties, may very well one-shot Aloy in some cases. Machine enemies are highly adaptable and change their attack style based on damage they sustain: removing an enemy's ranged weapon may provoke it to use new attack strategies not seen before, for example. This brilliant system makes combat unpredictable and interesting.

Elemental damage resistances and weaknesses, along with unique weakpoints such as ranged weapons, that can be detached and used against Aloy's enemies, all come into play depending on the enemy faced. A wide array of tools ranging from bows to technologically advanced bolt-casters opens up to plenty of approaches, while skill tree evolution goes a long way from start to end of the adventure. Enemy variants with even more deadly skills sum to the normal counterparts in due time, making combat all the more varied.

Quests
Ranged from the ordinary fetch task to more exotic ones such as Hunter Challenges or uniquely crafted missions with standalone parameters. Between challenges, regular quests and collectible-related tasks, there is really a whole lot to do, and it's interesting each time. Each quest is always indicated on the map, but in some cases a wide are is displayed and is up to player to think over how to progress. In the case of collectibles only the general area is hinted at, while the location remains hidden

Character Management
Can be performed on the fly at any moment, even in combat. Materials gathered from slain machines, hunted animals, herbs or containers all come into play in keeping Aloy stocked with munitions, potions and other supplies. Crafting is a regular task, and more exotic ammunition types will incur into higher expenses to make. Picking fights wisely, looting everything and selling unnecessary surplus are all key to not run out of materials.

Modding weapons and armor can make them much more powerful, while mods can adapt to a particular purpose or damage type: one can choose between a stronger but slower weapon, or favor DPS over raw damage, all depends on the mod configuration.


Weapon and gear mods can emphasize a specific type of damage, or increase rate of fire and resistances. They are essential later on.

Visually stunning with a great story. Nothing you could ever ask for a First-Party title from Sony that is now available on PC. I hope Sony would consider getting their exclusive titles ported to PC sooner than later. Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the best RPGs I have ever played. If you are into an RPG that has a good game play and excellent story, you might consider getting Horizon Zero Dawn. Trust me, once you've played it, you'll ask for more. Can't wait for Aloy's next adventure in Forbidden West.

I know this game had a really rocky release but they seem to have stabilized it quite nicely. I'm running a Ryzen 3600X, 1080TI, and 32GB RAM and getting a comfortable 60 FPS. Most settings are on High to Ultra in 1440p; 21:9. I get up to 75 in lower graphical impact areas and it never drops below 55 unless I'm in a city. All in all they've done a good job fixing it. I've been playing for almost 8 hours and haven't experienced one crash.

Wow! Horizon Zero Dawn is an amazing, perfect game! I enjoyed every second of the 93 hours it took me to 100% it. I admit I took it slow, exploring, visiting areas to see the surroundings, finding all collectibles and doing every side quest and errand, nothing felt like a chore, it was awesome from start to finish!

Graphics, scenery, combat, story, everything is so brilliant!

My only problem is I'm afraid every game I will play now will feel inferior!

I need to preface this review by noting that I am an adventure/puzzle gamer and avoid titles with combat. I also rarely play RPGs (although I played them frequently 'back in the day.'). So, HZD was a big step outside of my comfort zone.

I fell in love with the game within the first few minutes. You play Aloe (from a 3rd person perspective), a remarkable woman warrior who is an outcast from her tribe. You build skills, harvest resources, obtain weapons/armor, craft potions and ammo, gather collectibles, run errands, and do quests (side quests and the main story-line). The world is post apocalyptic with killer machines patrolling the landscape. Humans try to survive in a primitive culture.

The art is beautiful and the voice overs and overall sound track are exceptional. There is enough to see and do that I can play for hours (and hours) and always have a new experience to find. The world is truly 'open' and the map is vast, with settlements, ruins, vistas, and a host of mechanical creatures. A quick travel feature allows you to jump to points previously visited and you can save (as often as you like) at any campfire you have activated.

Since I am an admitted wuss at combat, I am playing with the difficulty set to 'Easy.' This means that I stand a chance of survival and can reap the full benefits of the game without constantly screaming in frustration. For me, however, the game is still challenging and requires stealth, strategy, and perfect execution of my plans. In HZD, brute force (charging into the fray) is not very effective and wastes a lot of resources.

The game has an intuitive interface and, although there are quite a few hot keys, most of the interface can be accessed through a single screen (map, inventory, crafting, quests, and notebook). The notebook is invaluable as you catalog the machines you've encountered and it provides an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each. For me, playing with a keyboard and mouse is most effective. The interface assists you by noting quest tasks, locations, etc. This may seem like hand-holding to some, but it is a nice feature to keep me on track.

My approach has been to initially invest in building XP, skills, and weapons/armor before moving to the main story quest. This requires gathering collectibles (which can be sold), doing lower level errands/side quests, and generally improving my character. I focused on building my health capacity and obtaining stealth skills/armor - two areas quite helpful to an adventurer. Although I am normally a completionist, I am not even thinking about Steam achievements at this phase of the game.

I highly recommend HZD to those who want to test the waters of a beautiful and engaging RPG with stealth/combat. There is no shame in playing with the 'Easy' setting if you are not a combat veteran. My only complaint is that HZD is very addictive. I keep returning to the game to do 'one more quest' and it is impacting my sleep schedule!

Wait for fixes.

Pray to god this game gets patched and the company cares enough to fix the bad port. Wait for this game to have its price slashed in half or lower, or wait for it to be patched and fixed. If they fix it, I'd recommend it. Right now, play the waiting game.

EDIT 1:

System specs:

GPU: GTX 1070
CPU: Ryzen 5 3600
RAM: 16 GB

Here are some suggestions that I have gotten from other users that have helped me in the meantime for anyone that does have the game. As suggested by Steam User Jom, I put Shadows at low and Ambient Occlusion at medium (the lowest it can go without turning it off) while leaving other settings at high. This greatly reduced the amount of stuttering and hiccups that I got.

As suggested by Tiny Rick, I went into the game folder and ran the .exe in Admin mode. This is supposed to help prevent crashes. I've been out of the starting area for a while and am running around the world. There is still some pretty nasty pop-in that happens now and then, but I haven't had any crashes while doing this, and I tried upping my graphics to ultra. So far, no hitches that I've been able to see so far because of this. Will continue to test it out to see if it runs better.

I got 20 hours into this game with only 2 crashes. Thought that my PC had been spared the technical problems that I've been hearing about so many people having. Now I can't get beyond a critical story stage because my game crashes ever 3-5 minutes so I will just have to stop playing this game because it's unplayable. What's worse, I can't even refund it anymore.

Where to even start with this game. I won't add spoilers, but even though the gameplay is great, and the graphics are top notch, it's the story that really hooks me and makes me think about the game even after having beat it several times.

To say that Horizons story is epic is like saying The Matrix was cool. It's an understatement. I've played a lot of games, and it is difficult to surprise me with plot, story, voice acting, motion capture. After hundreds of games, after awhile their stories start (rightly) looking like bad soap opera scripts, where the villain is as likely to monologue you to death as they are to fight you. Where you're forced to listen to endless manifestoes by the bad guys trying to justify their decisions.

Horizon is not like that. While it's story is fantastical and unbelievable, it is also not a soap opera. It's dramatic, but not fake hollywood drama. The writing of this game is more on par with a Nebula Award wining scifi novel. The team that wrote this game should write a book because as a fervent scifi reader, I would have put this story up there with The Three Body Problem, with A Deepness in the Sky, with Children of Time, with The Diamond Age. It's that level of writing and world building and just wow.

And the way the story unfolds, it's not forced exposition and narration that reveals the world of Horizons like a movie. Instead your own curiosity and need to know drives you to uncover the evidence, and to piece the puzzle together. Later in the game, much later, it is eventually made more clear what happened, but it never felt forced or boring. I never got the urge to skip a cutscene.

The Acting. The people in the game, the voice actors, the animators, the directors, they managed to make the characters feel like living, breathing people, not like video game characters. When a character does something, when they befriend you, or fight you, they do so for reasons that make sense to them, not because the story demands they do those things. As such, you feel like these are real people, flawed, doing the best they can. Aloy especially is one of the greatest video game protagonists of the last 20 years. She is more badass than Master Chief and yet she isn't a slow walking away from an explosion badass, she's an approachable, grounded, empathetic hero that feels like a person trying to do actual good in the world, not some stick figure killing machine that action games usually use as a place holder for actual heroics. It is also refreshing to see a female character whos armor is not a string bikini and who has free agency in their life. Aloy doesn't have a B story where she falls in love, she's not wooed or wooing, she's not sexualized in any manner, and feels like something that video games could direly use more of.

Then there are the NPCs in this world. Big, elaborate, organic, robo dinosaurs. You never get tired of seeing a walker the size of a skyscraper walk by and scaling it to get the lay of the land. Robo T-REX chasing you is the scariest thing in this game. Even when you can survive fighting them one on one, or learn the tame ability, encountering one of those things is always a heart attack. They just look so badass. I'm sure a real Trex never looked so incredibly deadly.

I have become a jaded video game player, and I seldom get excited for games anymore, especially big budget AAA games that all look and feel the same, the repeat sequels every year, new far cry, new assassins creed, etc, so boring. But Horizon is THE best game I have played in the last 10 years at least. At least it's the most enjoyable game I've played in a very long time.

Fighting the backlog

A typical way of increasing the backlog is to put open-world games there since they require a lot of time for completion while others not so much. I did the prologue and some missions in HZD then added it to my collection named "backlog" on Steam. I left it there for a year. Just recently I have decided to pick it up and I did not regret it. Not one bit. After clocking 80 hours with it I can safely say I've had most fun with this game in recent years.

A world overrun by machines

Initially HZD looks like a game taking place in prehistoric times. With your hero you use spear, bows and other ranged weapons to fight enemies. And while enemies include humans representing various tribes another group consists of machines. A lot of machines. Machines that look like huge lizards, crocodiles, hawks, bulls, crabs, panthers and even ostriches.

But who are these machines and where did they come from? The remains of old buildings and rusted out vehicles confirm something went wrong decades ago. Our protagonist, Aloy, initially wants a place for herself (acceptance is important as she is considered an outcast) but beside trying to improve the relations between various factions she is interested in exploring the story of the machines.

As one would expect from such an open-world game HZD has beautiful graphics, lots of cutscenes and great voice acting. Fans of Lance Reddick will rejoice as he plays an important part in the story. But then again the side missions and other activities will contribute mostly to your playtime as the story missions can be done in 10-20 hours.

Exploring the world

The world of HZD is huge and sports a lot of different locations. You can sprint along the river in barren wastelands or hunt for foxes, turkeys and boars in lush forests. Vantage points can often be accessed high up in snowy mountains and Aloy also infiltrates many bases - some found exclusively underground. Hunting animals (including fish in the river!) and gathering wood and all kinds of flowers will be important as crafting is required for almost everything be it the creation of special ammunition to your weapons or pouches to ensure you have increased capacity for all items. Inventory management can be pain and it requires some getting used to. You will also find a lot of unnecessary items only good for trading and finally we get to play a game where the collectibles can actually be given somebody, a collector, who is willing to reward you in return.

Skills

As expected this wouldn't be a real open-world game without skills to purchase and levelling up regularly. Abilities you buy can affect your melee combat, your stealth-based attacks and you can learn not only to override enemies but to mount some of your allied, machinery companions. Both missions and tougher combat give you a lot of XP - to fully max out Aloy you really need to do everything in the world HZD has to offer.

Focusing on highlighted areas

Combat is interesting. Rarer weapons will allow you to use new types of ammunition. You will soon learn as you explore that damage output alone cannot win you any combat. Aloy has a little bluetooth-like device called Focus - its special scanning technology will highlight weaker parts of the enemies. But you have to catalog all monsters during your first encounter to see what type of ammunition is their weakness.

For instance, those attacking you with fire-based liquid are almost completely fire resistant. Use freezing arrows here. Always look for highlighted parts that can be removed. An interesting type of arrow causes tearing which means no damage, at all, but a very high probability of removing components from the beasts.

Some parts explode after continued firing, others reveal additional (weaker) parts and various body parts act as weapons which means once removed you can actually use them against their previous owners. Each robot requires a different tactic which means encountering a herd with 3-4 different machines can easily be deadly for you. HZD can be enjoyed best when you triumph in such combats. You also have to bear in mind that Aloy can roll away to evade attacks but spamming the button allows the more perceptive enemies to figure out where you'll land so that they can attack accordingly. You can begin playing HZD as someone already familiar with the genre but this game will still give you many challenging encounters.

DLC

The Steam release of HZD comes years after its original release on the PS which means we get a DLC included. In The Frozen Wilds Aloy travels up north to more snowy areas where you'll face more difficult combat. It's fun how Lance Reddick laments that you really shouldn't enter the new region before completing your current task (referring to the main story); as long as you've met the needed level requirement you'll be fine. And if you still aren't bored of HZD after all this there's New Game+ and higher difficulty levels offering you even more options for character customization.

Summary

HZD is an exceptionally great game with challenging combat, interesting story and a built-in photo mode that allows you to demonstrate your creative abilities. While the story feels cheesy sometimes and some side missions are repetitive your time in this dystopian future will definitely be well spent. Hope you'll have a powerful rig as HZD can be very demanding.

I waited to write this review until I had enough time in the game to really assess it.

Broken down, here is my opinion. This is only an opinion.

First the world: It's amazing, beautiful and immerses you into the story. The story line is engaging and pulls you in. You look forward to your next clue. It is well designed and written. It creates emotion in the player as you feel what Aloy is experiencing. The voice acting for the main quest and story are done very well.

The Main Quest: Engaging and makes you want to continue on. It is well voiced and the dialogue makes sense and is worth listening to.

Combat: The machine AI and game AI are some of the best I have seen. Machines will learn as the fight progresses and will learn from the players play style so that they will attack when they have the advantage and hide when the player has the advantage. Strategy before engagement is the key. Using the tools provided the player, prior and during combat will usually end with success. not using the tools given, or jumping in without a strategy for each combat situation will usually end in defeat. Bandit camps are engaging and challenging and again strategy is the key when infiltrating a bandit camp. I really enjoyed the combat in this game. It never felt cookie cutter or static. It always felt fresh and challenging. Every situation is completely different. Even during the second play through, when I thought I knew what was going to happen, the machines and situation changed. It was never dull. I enjoyed the challenge and the overall combat experience.

Combat Mechanics: As far as the player character or Aloy goes, the mechanics in combat are fantastic. They are varied and unique. They make you want to learn and perfect the harder moves in combat to see the effect and damage they do. Animations for Aloy, in combat, were very well done and they make you want to try different things in a fight. Again no cookie cutter combat here.
As far as the machines and enemy NPC’s go, combat mechanics again are incredible. You can actually see the machines think and work together, their animations are very well done and make the machines look alive. Human enemy NPC’s are the same way, they work together and can be very challenging to fight.

Side quests: Some are well done, some are a bit out of context and don't really make sense. Voicing in the side quests can get a bit sub-par, the dialogue in some cases feels forced and awkward.
Errand quests: Mostly sub-par and awkward and don't really fit the story very well, although some are necessary for the end game conflict. Voicing again in errand quests feels forced and awkward. It's almost like the errand quests and some side quest were after thoughts just to add content, that really didn't fit. None of which detracted from the game either, they just didn't add anything useful to the experience.

The Frozen North DLC: The world up north is amazing and beautiful, very immersive. Combat up north is incredible. I loved the challenge and the experience. The game, up north, again, makes you feel what Aloy is experiencing. You almost feel the cold, the dark and the loneliness. You can see and feel the harshness of the environment and feel for the Banuk, who have chosen to live there.
The main quest in the Frozen North, is well done and voiced very well, it makes you want to complete it. It makes sense and adds to the main game in an immersive way.
Side quests and errand quests in the Frozen North, are well done as far as voicing and dialogue. They make sense and are on par with the level of voicing and dialogue of the main game. I really enjoyed the time spent in the Frozen North.

Overall: I highly recommend this game, it is an experience that most will enjoy and probably will play for a long time. I am sure most people will play through this game multiple times.

At the time of this writing I have about 200 hours in the game and have completed the regular game and a Game+ play through to the end. I will play it again. In my humble opinion, this game is well worth the price.

It takes a lot of convincing for me to invest in any AAA title of this size, but my god it was worth it. Horizon Zero Dawn left a lasting impression.

This is one of those games that may be worth delaying progression through the main story, if you don't want to run the risk of losing interest upon completion of the final mission. Even finding all the collectable's can be fun, mainly because the tedious ones that are hidden from the map don't count towards 100% completion! 😁

My only gripes, which don't have much of an impact on my overall experience, would be:
- Poorly optimised for PC. I purposefully sacrificed frames to have a better graphical experience (worth it)
- Weird NPC audio, where if you're some distance from the character it'd be impossible to tell which direction the audio is coming from, and they'd often sound just as loud when you're next to them as when you're say 100 metres away from them
- Not much range with the facial expression, all the models look like they've had about 50 botox injections
- The game is well balanced, but be careful of levelling up too fast too early on, as it does make some missions slightly easier than they should be
- Hilariously unconvincing death animations/acting!

Overall I'd give this a solid 9/10. Probably a 10 if it weren't for all of the above. Would recommend 👍

Horizon Zero Dawn is a third person action game set in a post apocalyptic open world where the Earth has been overrun by machines and the remains of Humanity live in small tribes with primitive technology. The player character, Aloy, must go on a quest to investigate the origin of the machines and the fall of the previous civilization.

Gameplay

• Along her journey, Aloy will fight against machines and Human bandits. The design of the machines is really cool. Their appearance and behaviour is similar to animals such as horses, cows, tigers, bulls, crabs, crocodiles, hawks, or dinosaurs like the velociraptor, brontosaurus and t-rex. As well as melee attacks, some of them have laser weapons mounted on their back, or can spam fire or frost projectiles at you, and one machine even has a cloaking device.

• Most bandits are armed with axe or bow, but their leaders have powerful heavy weapons like a minigun or grenade launcher, which you can pick up and use until they run out of ammo.

• Aloy can wield a staff for melee attacks and various different types of bows which can shoot arrows enhanced with elemental damage. Fire does extra damage over time, frost will slow enemy movement and increase damage taken, while shock will stun them for a few seconds leaving them vulnerable to a critical melee attack. There’s also a really useful skill which lets you load up two or three arrows to fire simultaneously with any bow.

• There’s a strong focus on using stealth, hiding in long grass to sneak past groups of powerful enemies, or getting close enough to perform a melee takedown on weaker enemies.

• Combat can be quite tactical. One of my favourite weapons, the Tripcaster, lets you place explosive or shock tripwires on the ground, which will detonate when a machine runs over them. Before the start of a fight, I liked to place a few tripwires in strategic locations, between trees or rocks, then I’d stand with the tripwires between myself and the machines, shooting the machines with arrows while trying to lure them into charging through the tripwires.

• Some machines have weak points that can be targeted to deal extra damage, or you can destroy their weapon components to reduce their threat to you, although this can be tricky when fighting against fast moving or flying enemies. Its actually easier when fighting bosses because of their huge size and slower movement.

• You can unlock the ability to override machines to make them fight each other, or to use them as a mount to travel around the world quicker. I didn’t use mounts often because I quickly discovered that this will draw aggro from lots of nearby enemies (similar to driving a car in a Far Cry game), so its less stressful to just sneak around on foot.

• You can buy several outfits from traders which change Aloy’s appearance. Weapons and outfits can be upgraded with modifications which provide bonuses to various damage types, damage resistances, or stealth.

Story

• Story is very well written with an interesting sense of mystery, and I enjoyed slowly piecing together what happened in the old world. The conflict between Humans and machines has similarities to the likes of The Terminator and The Matrix.

• Most side quests have unique stories which are of a similar quality level to those in Witcher 3, and much better than the copy and paste tasks usually found in open world games. Sometimes you’ll wander across machines and Humans fighting each other, while clearing bandit camps will allow friendly tribes to move in. All of these elements help to bring the world to life.

• Voice acting is fantastic, especially Ashly Burch (who previously voiced Chloe in Life is Strange) as Aloy and Lance Reddick (Fringe, Quantum Break) who plays an important supporting character.

• Lip syncing during cutscenes is the best I’ve seen since Hellblade Senua’s Sacrifice.

Technical

• The environment looks fantastic, from the forests, rivers and snowy mountains to deserts and ruined buildings of the old world.

• I had a smooth framerate during combat with machines and while exploring the world. The only significant problems I encountered were around a few bandit camps where my framerate dipped into the 40s, I’m assuming this was caused by columns of smoke because I didn’t see them anywhere else. I had some minor framerate drops in large settlements of NPCs, which wasn’t the end of the world because it didn’t affect any fast paced gameplay.

• It took me 61 hours to complete the main quest, expansion, and lots of side quests. During this time I only crashed twice, so the game was very stable for me. Both crashes occurred before the release of patch 1.06 so it seems that whatever was causing the problem has been fixed.

• Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.

• The camera has a mind of its own, sometimes changing position by itself. By default, Aloy will be slightly offset to the left of screen, like most third person games. However, there are times when the camera drifts so that Aloy is almost all the way to the right of the screen, which feels slightly disorienting. Its not an issue that makes the game unplayable, because you can immediately reset the camera position by aiming the bow. This also means its not a problem during combat because you’ll almost always be aiming. Its just a really strange design decision that doesn’t serve any purpose, and I can’t think of any other game I’ve played in the last few years where I’ve felt like I’m fighting the camera.

Recommendation

Horizon Zero Dawn is an amazing game and I rate it as an absolute must play for action game fans. Combat and story are both excellent and while there are some technical flaws, they aren’t big enough reasons to avoid playing. The amount of content makes this easily worth a full price purchase.

Let me say this first. I've been holding off on the purchase due to technical issues ppl have been reporting. After about a week I came to conclusion that from what I can see the negative reviews are of a technical nature so ... I decided to use my 2hrs refund option - if required.

Oh boy, let me say that. It was worth the risk. I had maybe 3 stutters in last 20 hours of play, but given, I'm not playing on a potato.

For comparison my specs:
CPU: Inter i5-9600K 3.7GHz
RAM: 16GB
GPU: RTX2070 (as pointed out by generals of internet and comments)

In the fist 2 hours of the game there is no chance in hell you will be able to stress test your computer. The first 5-10 minutes the game takes it sweet time to detect your graphical settings. Mine were set to MEDIUM. Hands down the slowest auto detection process I've seen in my life so far. Then you have slow introduction to the story and game mechanics. I definitely wasn't rushing but even if you do I doubt you get to the city where majority of users are experiencing issues (low fps etc).

What I'm trying to say, give this game a chance. If you are having problems in the first 2 hours then refund. If you are unsure refund. But you MUST set the timer for 1hr and 55 mins. I did that and did not realise how quickly these 2 hours passed. I would compare this game to Far Cry 3 which I enjoyed the most in the series. All the sneaking can get quite tedious but there are different ways you can play this game (various armour types + skills, makes this possible).

22 hours in and I discovered half of the map. I'm taking it easy and doing some side quests.

Oh, and I haven't seen any macro transactions in the game so that is also good.

To summarise it is an enjoyable experience that pulled me in. I can't stress how much I recommend the game. I would easily trade 100 titles from my library to play this.

DISCLAIMER: This 'Review' is only about performance settings/recommendations

If you haven't watched the Digital Foundry video on this game, I highly recommend doing so -

YouTube™ Video: Horizon Zero Dawn PC: An Amazing Game Gets A Disappointing Port 
Views: 656,661
After a stunning debut in Death Stranding, the Decima Engine is back - this time with a port of Guerrilla Games' stunning Horizon Zero Dawn.


I've gone ahead and copy pasted their recommended/optimized settings for those that just want the TLDW:

Medium Textures
Ultra Model Quality
Driver Enforced 16x AF
High Shadows
Medium Reflections
High Clouds
TAA
Motion Blur On
Medium Ambient Occlusion
Dynamic Resolution OFF
V-SYNC OFF
Exclusive Fullscreen ON
They also recommend putting your PCIE to x16 in your bios ( This looks to be the first game to care about that )

**My personal recommendation: Use RTSS ( Rivatuner Statistic Server. It comes with MSI Afterburner ) to cap the FPS to 60 to stabilize frametimes. Don't use the in-game limiter. It sucks.

I do want to emphasize that the PS4 version uses the 'Original' preset AKA 'Medium'. The game already looked fantastic on PS4 so if all you care about is framerate
and don't want to mess with settings, that is the preset I'd use unless your PC is weaker than a PS4. I'd still turn off Dynamic Resolution though since it seems to suck.

And of course, download the latest drivers for your GPU.

With the above settings I get 83 avg FPS @ 1440p on the built-in benchmark. You can see full details in my screenshots.

Specs: 2700x, 16GB ram, 1080ti

Will update this 'review' if needed.

EDIT on 11/27/20: Nominating this for my GOTY in the Steam awards. Even though this released years ago on PS4, I feel it deserves it. I enjoyed it so much that I 100% it on both PS4 and PC.

This is a must buy game for everyone who wants to indulge themselves in a single player, story rich open world game.
Soundtrack is a masterpiece in itself.
Good 30+ Hours for the story on leisure pace and 70+ Hours if you are a completionist.

Final Opinion: JUST BUY & PLAY IT!

Looking forward to more Sony PlayStation games on Steam.

Product refunded

I was excited to finally play this on PC after enjoying the ps4 version BUT >>>>>>>>Refunded due to the very intrusive data collection and DRM the game forces you to accept. There is no way to not accept it and you basically have to accept a key logger that can track websites visited even without the game being ran by the wording on the agreement.


This is just part of the terms you have to accept. And this is just from their "limited" option.

Network Data: Information about your device's network connections (such as mobile, Ethernet, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) including IP address and the number, requirements and speed of the connections.

Configuration Data: Information about your device's configuration, such as the manufacturer, model, number of processors, display size and resolution, date, region, language, locale and capabilities.

Security Data: Information necessary to detect and investigate malicious, unauthorized or fraudulent activities.

Legal Data: Information required by applicable law and to demonstrate compliance.

They will say its to fix bugs... If so you dont need my connection info, all you need can be sent by a crash log. You dont need to know what sites I visit when your game is or is not running. You dont need to know if I have mods attached being a single player game.

I have well over the average when it comes to games owned. This is probably the most intrusive, albeit not hidden in a wall of text, thing I have ever seen. I would reconsider buying it if you can disable all data collection but until then I will reallocate my funds to a different game.

After some research I found this game was ported by Chinese developers (Virtuos) so if you know the stigma surrounding these (Chinese) companies such as Tencent you know it is all about selling data, that should tell you all you need to know.

Edit: For anyone wondering exactly what it ask I have 2 screenshots in my SS library (no clue how to link here) taken from Days Gone (also refunded) and its the exact same wording. Even if this is a Blanket statement on any Sony game it needs a simple opt out feature hands down.

FIX FOR A LOT OF CRASHES!

Right click on Desktop -> Display Settings -> scroll at the bottom -> click on Graphics Settings -> Click the button to be ON at the 1st section called Hardware Accelerated Gpu Scheduling

This fixed all crashes for me and was experiencing one every 20 minutes at least.

Now the actual review:

The game is fantastic. Despite all the crashes I endured, I plowed through at least 1/3rd of the game and the feeling was "man if it only worked". With my fix, it works.

There are 3 main elements to talk about:

1. The visuals
This game looks amazing. A high end pc will probably make this game into a work of art, but I'm running it on an I7-4790 CPU, 16GB RAM and a GTX 1070. I run it on High, it does 60 FPS constantly with no problems:
DO NOT USE ADAPTIVE PERFORMANCE FPS! It's a BAD feature and it makes the game look worse than all low settings and run under 25 FPS. Look for a nice sweetspot, and it will look amazing.

2. The gameplay
This is the Atlas of this game, as it Carries it on it shoulders. The world is fantastic to explore. The hunting of machines is great, the bigger ones actually evolve over time and methods used to get kills start to not work so well. Walking the world.. just feels fun. You constantly interact with an everchanging world. What it does lack... is variety in it's main missions. But despite eventually seeing a pattern in design choices, it still doesn't matter that much. Why fix what isn't broken.

3. The story.
The story is fantastically hit and miss. Both of em. The main mistery of the game will keep you captivated, enthralled, fascinated by truly being a SCI-FI wonder, comparable to the first Mass Effect Game. In fact, with it's post apocalyptic plausible scenario, based on personal preference it might even be better. I won't spoil it, but the main quest is fantastic.
The miss comes the strong and powerful woman. Perhaps it's just 2020, the year and time where Strong and powerful bland pieces of wood are pushed to the forefront, but playing this game you can't help but notice it. The men in this game are either a**holes, incompetent, ignorant, soft, malicious, capricious, or just plain dumb. No. Exception. Which either sets them up as bad character archetypes or ... actually interesting flawed characters with pros and cons. The women however.... are Jesus. All of them. Without exception (in 47 hours of gameplay) all women have no flaws. They're all strong. They're all powerfull, and while always being presented as good at what they do, and you could deduce flaws by proxi - aka Oh she's a politician, so she might not be much of a fighter, for example - this is never outright said. Men on the other hand: here's a great warrior, who's also a drunken manchild. Or here's a wise rules who seeks piece, but he he's kind of incompetent and in absolute awe of his Strong And Powerful female bodyguard.

It's not AS bad as something like Captain Karen, but it is there. Whether intentional or not, weather the current political climate makes these flaws more apparent.. they are there. And once you see them, you can't unsee them. Case and point: Humanity is in a hunter gatherer phase. Ok so this tribe is a Matriarchy. Ok, women are lifegivers, so they are seen as leaders, hell even the game points out that this is not a criteria for leadership... but wait most hunters are women? The warchief is a woman? Her second in command happens to be a male who is incompetent and deuchy? Wait what?!

That kind of thing.

As a conclusion:
I cannot recommend this game enough. It's flaws are there. Are visible, but what it can deliver, it blows out of the water. It's a fantastic gameplay experience with a great overarching story, and at end of the day, a competently written cast of colorful men and bland women. (exception: Sobek. They give this charater one good moment of being flawed. I thing they should have doubled down on that moment, but that's me)

From an industry standpoint: Buy this game, find the fix that works for you and let's show the world that "exclusivity" is not the smart way to go.

This is probably stuff that has been covered by everyone else, but I've been enjoying this game a lot overall and wanted to cover some of the good and bad aspects.

Performance/Technical

From a technical point of view, this is not the best PC port. I started playing this with an Intel 4790K and 5700XT and the experience was good overall on a 1440p high refresh monitor. but this is the first game I've played that has actually hit 100% CPU usage from time to time on that processor, which resulted in occasional minor stuttering.

I have since upgraded to a Ryzen 5600X and Geforce 3070 and I have not experienced any stuttering at all with a 12-thread CPU and am getting an average 80-100 fps at 1440p using the optimised settings recommended by Digital Foundry.

There are some animations such as leaves/foliage and certain cutscenes that run at 30fps, but I personally didn't find this particularly distracting.

In a nutshell, if you're using a modern PC with a CPU with 12+ threads and a fairly modern GPU (e.g. Radeon 5700XT or beyond) and you're playing at modest resolutions like 1440p or 1080p then you'll have a very good experience. On a CPU with 8 threads you'll find the experience to be overall mostly good, but if you're using an older i5 that doesn't have hyperthreading, I'm going to say the game probably won't run well.

I did originally purchase this game on PS4 and found it to not be very enjoyable at 30fps / 1080p on console, so I will say that this is definitely a big improvement overall on the PS4 experience in my opinion.

EDIT: additionally, I've noticed that when playing the game on an SDR monitor, it sometimes can be very dark, and sometimes very bright. I'm guessing this has something to do with the way that HDR is getting tonemapped down to SDR. I found that I ultimately had to turn the in-game brightness up at certain points and it was kind of annoying.

EDIT 2: After playing more I have experienced a couple of glitches which I consider to be very minor. Firstly, when hunting wildlife, occasionally when you make a kill the animal will spin really fast before dying. It's kind of funny and immersion breaking but not a big deal imo and happens infrequently.

Additionally, in the final mission some smoke/fog was much more opaque than it should have been for a brief segment, and in one instance when Aloy was in shadow the shadows blocked up to full black rather than shades of grey. Both of these glitches impacted only a very small segment of gameplay.

Also, the first time I booted up the game I had to wait for shaders to optimise which was kind of annoying, but this is only a one time thing.

I have not experienced any other major glitches or crashes myself but YMMV.

The game itself

I've been thoroughly enjoying my time playing this game. Generally speaking, I tend to play games in shortish (~1-2 hour) bursts and it can take me a few months to finish a game like this. Because of my limited gaming time, I only tend to finish games if they can really hold my attention over such a long period, which is quite infrequent.

With that in mind, I will say that so far I have been playing this game on and off for 2-3 months and am about 80% through the main story. The fact that the game has held my attention for this long and that I want to keep going back and playing more I think is credit to the quality of the game itself.

I do have some criticisms of the gameplay, mainly that the inventory system is quite convoluted and you have to collect certain arbitrary items to buy weapons, craft upgrades, etc. (e.g. to craft an ammo capacity upgrade might cost 500 metal shards, a boar bone and a fox tail) and you can only climb things if there are handholds which you have to go searching for.

The gameplay loop is also not exactly unique or groundbreaking, it is quite similar to other open world games such as Assassin's Creed, however the story, art style, and world building made this one of the more engaging open world games that I've played personally.

I did find Aloy kind of annoying at times. She sometimes acts like a petulant child, though I suppose it maybe makes sense that she's not well adjusted considering her upbringing... (I'm trying to justify this)

I know that there has also been some criticism of the game for appropriation of aspects of Native American culture -- I don't feel qualified to write about this at length, but wanted to mention it and would recommend reading into that from other writers.

EDIT 3: Some relevant articles include "What We Talk About, When We Don’t Talk About Natives" by Dia Lacina and "Horizon Zero Dawn DLC The Frozen Wilds Uncomfortably Borrows from Native Cultures" by Holly Green.

Overall

If you like story driven, scifi-ish open world games and you have a fairly modern PC, then you will most likely enjoy this game.

Highly recommended for explorers who also enjoy a good story!

Beautiful and interesting world to explore. Characters are actually memorable - even ones that you only meet during small side quests. The stories and lore are intriguing and it's hard not to get emotionally invested when doing quests. The game has both made me shed a tear and laugh out loud. Combat is fun and varied - it's satisfying when you manage to take out a tough machine by utilizing the information you have about weakpoints and making use of your arsenal of different weapons and ammo. There are several different difficulties you can choose from and you can change it at any point (except in New Game +). If you want to just focus on the story and want combat to be easy then Story mode is great - for the most part you don't have to worry about hitting weakpoints on machines. You can take them down without. The higher the difficulty the more important it gets to be strategic about your attacks. I especially enjoyed the stealthy features of the game, but usually it's up to you how you handle each situation. I played through on story mode (since I expect to go for the Ultra Hard New Game + achievement, so nice to just focus on the story the first time around), so often taking the stealthy approach isn't technically needed - I just found it fun. :) But it's likely a much more needed strategy at times on higher difficulties - unless you enjoy being overrun and trampled by a herd of machines. :D

A thing I really love about the game is the mix of high action combat, stealth and more chill exploration. Even if there are many machines to take on, there are also plenty of areas in the world where you have room to just relax and enjoy the scenery. I love how well the character animations are done - not just on Aloy (the character you play), but also on all the different characters that you interact with. All dialogue is voice acted and the character animations actually follow what is said - both in speech and expressing emotions. When Aloy moves around in the world her animation changes depending on the terrain - whether she's sliding down a steep slope or hiking through deep snow and so on. It's just all very well made and all helps to increase the level of immersion while playing. Small details that all add up. :)

For achievement hunters it should be noted there's no "point of no return" - once you finish the main questline you'll load the last save before that quest and can then choose to finish up anything you might have missed or intentionally skipped. It will take 2 playthroughs to get all achievements though, since you can't access New Game + until you finish the game the first time. But the second playthrough should be much faster if you completed everything else the first time around. :)

Gorgeous scenery, intriguing story, fun combat, lots of collectibles and lore elements to find, great exploration including some parkour - what's not to like??? HZD is definitely in my Top 10 of favorite games.

I am stupid. I read the reviews. I knew the truth. But I told myself, "I keep my gaming machine clean. I don't have the problems others often complain about with games. It'll run fine for me". Of course, it didn't. This isn't the worst game I've ever played, but it's definitely the worst PC port. You will spend more time trying to get it to run acceptably than you will playing it.

Forget about getting 60 FPS. You probably can't. I don't care what kind of system you have. This game is far too poorly optimized. But it doesn't matter anyway because framerate will be the least of your concerns. The CONSTANT studdering and "skipping" during gameplay and cutscenes would make the game unplayable even if the crashes, audio cutting out, and HDR not working properly didn't already do so.

Even if you manage to get 60 FPS, all you're really going to get is 60>studder>60>studder>60>studder>59>studder>60>studder.

It takes a LOT for me to leave a negative review for a game. But this is in no way enjoyable. After another night of alt-tabbing and switching from borderless to full screen and back again over and over just trying to get HDR to not look worse than SDR, for literally an hour, I stopped to type this review. I go to work early and come home late. I shouldn't be typing a review right now. I should be gaming.

There is absolutely zero chance that they didn't know this was absolutely awful, and they just released it anyway. They deserve all the bad reviews they get. This is the 2nd time I've paid Guerilla for this game (I really enjoyed it on PS4 Pro the first time), and I will never give them another dime. Not because the game isn't perfect, but because it's completely, absolutely, totally, obviously unenjoyable in its current state... and they took my money anyway. Never again. Not on PC; not on PS4; not on PS5.

EDIT: User logan5 informed me after writing this review that Guerilla Games did not handle this port internally. I did not know this (especially since their logo and SCIE's are the only logos which appear the splash screen), so maybe I shouldn't be so hard on Guerilla in particular. However, their name and logo is on this port. They (and Sony) had the final say on its release. So I still think much of the responsibility still falls on them-- they are where the "buck stops", so to speak.

Loved it on PS4. Love it on PC.

Cool chick fights giant robots with a Bow and a permanent frown. Aloy is a badass Queen.

Cant wait for the sequel.

I got a solid 3 hours of the game, and now cannot even launch it. It crashes on startup, reinstalling does not fix this issue, nor does verification, and I cannot get a refund now due to the 2 hour time limit. Either do not purchase at all, or wait for a few months for the developers to realize releasing a buggy port like this is unprofessional and unacceptable. I had to unsync from the steam cloud and delete my profile and save data to get the game to run at all, thank you to the person who commented that fix. I'm still gravely disappointed that a company decided to release a game in this state, however.

PS: To the idiot who says "They're looking into a fix for the launch crashing" no ♥♥♥♥ they are, they're losing money. Doesn't matter, you shouldn't launch a game that won't even run properly, it's unprofessional.

PSS: To the idiot who says "all these people giving it negative reviews because they don't know how to keep their graphics drivers up to date and blame the game." i update my stuff the day a new version releases. Don't be a dumbass.

This game is not ready for PC as of 10AUG2020. There are workarounds and I've tried most of them. There having to be workarounds to get a game to work is rather ridiculous. These "solutions" have given me more time before crashing randomly again however, it is still happening frequently enough to make me wish I had not purchased this game yet. The developers are reportedly working frantically to find a fix and it's only been a few days since release so there's hope. Until there is a legitimate fix I think I'll just leave this one alone.

The annoying crashing aside... it's a decent game. Controls are a bit clunky but it's a console game so yeah, I assume that's expected for most players for a pc port. Not always the case but certainly is with this one. There is a bit of grind to it for various materials but it's not that bad. You get most of them and not even realize it while moving to various objectives.

Due to the technical errors I can't give this game a thumbs up. It's too big of an annoyance to overlook. If not for that I would give the game a thumbs up but just barely.

Hands down Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the best games i have ever played!
It has great story , great gameplay , great character development , great body expressions , great facial animations.
Aloy the main protagonist of this game is one of best female protagonist i have ever encountered! (Obviously Lara Croft is No.1)
This game delivers some gorgeous and stunning visuals and in my opinion that's the strongest point of this game!
Everything about this game is absolutely Phenomenal!!
This game also gives some memorable and amazing soundtracks!
What more could you ask for???
Thank you GUERILLA for making this game its amazing!
The developers really did an amazing job with this project.
Waiting for their next project Forbidden West!
Hope they will bring HFW to PC and it will be soon!

Sale or not sale buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Game Dude and trust me u will get an awesome experience!

And finally Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the most memorable experience in my whole life, now I am 29 years old and i am a gamer since my childhood. i played countless masterpiece and HZD is one of them!
So it's a 10/10 for Me.

By far one of the most engaging awe inspiring games i have ever played
The game takes place in a post apocalyptic world where a young girl named Aloy finds out her purpose , and it has cool robot animals too . The mechanics felt good and easy to grasp .
The game being a PS port did have some bugs here and there and my game crashed once or twice,
shaders still needs a bit more optimisation . I also wish if they would add more facial expressions for Aloy during photo mode . In-game cut-scene lip sync seemed a bit off during certain occasions .
The audio was kinda neutral , it was not the best but it wasn't that bad either
Regardless of the attention it got i still feel this game is a bit underrated .
A really fun engaging game in its core . Totally worth the price .

Edit 1 is up and you will find it below the dotted line, i am leaving the original up so people can see what was originally rated helpful.

I, personally, have not run into as many crashes or glitches as others have but i do have a few critiques to give other than the terrible port.

Cons:
1. The game needs a aim sensitivity slider ASAP, its not a big problem if you have a mouse that has an adjustable sensitivity button but for those that don't it makes aiming a chore.
2. The UI is obviously made for controllers and is frustrating to use with a keyboard and mouse. the mouse constantly goes to where you don't want it to if you use any navigation method other than it, and crafting is annoying when you are in your inventory.
3. when you are running around as Aloy it almost feels as if she moves independently from the mouse, which cause me to run into walls constantly and creates a feeling of suggestion rather than control. for me this also dampens the cinematic experience the game offers because i am forced to always be mindful that forward is not always forward.

Pros:
1. The visuals are stunning, and definitely benefit from 60fps and pc graphics
2. The story is spectacular, i found myself bonding with Aloy and caring for characters i had only just met, and scenes actually emotionally impacted me throughout.
3. Combat is dynamic and rewards you for experimenting with different play styles and tools. The skill tree is a nice accent to this already flushed out system
4. The world is not only vast, but also deep unlike most current open world games that have been released. i find myself searching through each area for collectibles and ruins to immerse myself deeper into this world
5. collectibles actually have meaning, either through providing backstory or rewarding the player.
6. Sidequests are fun and provide compelling dialogue most of the time, i have only run into one that i haven't liked.
7. The factions in the game are interesting and feel fully fleshed out, with each having their own specialties and reasons for why they developed in that way.

Thats all i have to say for now, for people like me who were lucky enough to not have run into a lot of bugs or poor performance the game is spectacular, but until the developers can guarantee that for everyone i am going to have to not recommend this game. i Will update my review in the future if i end up running into such issues or the developers fix them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit 1: Hello all, thanks for liking my review! I have quite a few more hours in the game so i would like to provide more feedback along with clarify some of my points which seem to have confused some people. I would also like to add that in my reviews i do not include bugs since they either get patched out quickly or change too often, for this reason i will add a bug rating at the bottom of the pros and cons to give a rough idea.

Aim: Firstly, i would like to address aim sensitivity, as i have seemed to have confused some people with my wording. I know there is a general aim sensitivity slider in game and that it adjusts overall sensitivity. When i was talking about aim sensitivity i was referring to ADS, or Aim Down Sights sensitivity when aiming with the bow. Sorry for the confusion.

Movement: The second point of confusion was with Aloys movement, when i mentioned it felt more like suggestion than direction. To go more in depth with this idea i will try and describe it as best i can and leave you guys to judge. When moving as Aloy the camera is in a third person perspective and follows her around, using WASD you can move the player model around but the camera will not follow her movements precisely. sometimes Aloy will move closer to the center of the camera while other times she will move further away. This problem is only noticeable when traversing the map, since in combat ADS is locked to a certain spot over her shoulder.

Now, i would like to revise my pros and cons list to include what i have experienced in the extra play time i have gotten. New pros and cons will appear at the bottom of their respective lists and be identifiable with an indention along with the bottom paragraph being added to them since some people missed that, and some of them may also be edited to improve their wording

Cons:
1. (changed) The game needs an aim down sights sensitivity slider ASAP, its not a big problem if you have a mouse that has an adjustable sensitivity button but for those that don't it makes aiming a chore when using the bow. You can get used to it after a while, but the moment you play another game with your proper sensitivity you can feel the difference.
2. The UI is obviously made for controllers and is frustrating to use with a keyboard and mouse. the mouse constantly goes to where you don't want it to if you use any navigation method other than it, and crafting is annoying when you are in your inventory.
3. (changed) When you are running around as Aloy It feels like the camera and movement system are tied together by a rubber band. You have full control over the camera but Aloys position relative to it can vary, making you have to be constantly aware that forward is not always forward. This mostly happens during navigation and not combat.
-4. The game, as of now, has poor performance for most and is poorly optimized for pc. I have only crashed twice, both after leaving the game on for a long period of time, but if the
game cannot run properly for everyone with the proper equipment then that is a con in my
book.

Pros:
1. The visuals are stunning, and definitely benefit from 60fps and pc graphics.
2. The story is spectacular, i found myself bonding with Aloy and caring for characters i had only just met, along with scenes emotionally impacting me throughout.
3. (changed) Combat is dynamic and rewards you for experimenting with different play styles and tools. The skill tree is a nice accent to this already flushed out system along with the various arrow types you eventually gain.
4. The world is not only vast, but also deep unlike most current open world games that have been released. I find myself searching through each area for collectibles and ruins to immerse myself deeper into this world.
5. Collectibles actually have meaning, either through providing backstory or rewarding the player.
6. (changed) Sidequests are fun and provide compelling dialogue most of the time, i have only run into two that i haven't liked.
7. The factions in the game are interesting and feel fully fleshed out, with each having their own specialties and reasons for why they developed in that way.
-8. Its hard to word this, but the game never feels like you are in a play area. I never looked at a mountain and said "yup there is the border" because it never crossed my mind to think
of it that way. This feeling is helped by the various people you meet that bring back story to
almost every area, making locations feel like homes and towns instead of a checkpoints.

Bug rating: Likely to run into a few minor bugs, Examples of minor bugs: Glitched faces, skipped dialogue, brief broken terrain, etc.

Once again i will update this as i feel the need to. I really hope they fix the issues with the port so that everyone can have as much fun as i have with the game. I cannot stress enough that in its current state you are likely to run into game breaking problems even if some of us have not, BUYERS BEWARE.

This game is a true masterpiece and kept me captivated for 100s of hours. The visuals are breathtaking and the athmosphere of the game really pulled me in. It all fits together - a great main character in an epic and gripping story, stunning visuals, an awesome soundtrack, all set in a consistent, nuanced and interesting world with interesting quests.
And it has so many of the little things which often make the difference between meh and yeah.
The DLC content is not only seamlessly added on, but integrated into the original story line.
Thank you for porting this game to the PC.

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

This was a beautiful game. It's a game you could theoretically finish without much effort and time, but the world, the side characters, and the cultures played so deep a part in the story that I found myself sinking 200+ hours into it and not thinking twice. There is so much here in lore picked up in scraps and holograms hidden on your travels.

The thing that stuck out to me the most here was the relationships. Helping the people of the world was as important to the story as anything else, and it comes full circle . There are as many opportunities to show compassion and to be human as there are to kill things. It is such a human story that sets itself apart from your run-of-the-mill first-person shooter. It's exploration and mystery as much as it is combat. It's learning about people and cultures as much as it is learning about the machines, the world, and the secret of what Zero Dawn really is. This is not to distract from the story which was absolutely unique and incredible in how it unfolds, especially as you get closer to the heart of the truth.

The cultures Aloy interacts with throughout her travels are also shown in such a nuanced light. No one culture is shown to be bad or good, or "backwards" and the belief systems that each one possesses (which can cause tension) are shown to be what they are, all truths in some way, just seen from different angles or metaphysical alignments. Each one is well thought-out and sketched in intricate detail, whether it's the lumbering town of Pitchcliff nestled in the Northern mountains, or the sweeping mesa of Meridian, each place is important in some way.

I think this all ties into a larger point. The story itself felt so full of life, emotion, and meaning. Aloy finds and loses loved ones, makes and loses friends, makes enemies, explores the world, and finds herself swept up into a bigger purpose, but that purpose never grows so large that it leaves behind the reason that Aloy is fighting in the first place: People, and not just her own. Everyone. In the end, 

The combat was also engaging and skill-intensive. I played through the game on ultra-hard and it was such a challenge, but in a good way. Each machine is different, and figuring out how to handle each one was a game in and of itself.

I'm excited to see where they take the sequel. The post-credits scene made me excited to explore the world more, which is a tall order for someone who just spent 200+ hours doing just that.

Horizon Zero Dawn is an amazing adventure game where prehistoric meets futuristic.

Visually stunning with a story rich settled on an open world, it's quite astonishing what Guerrilla reached with it considering that at the time they developed it they still were just a game studio with few games released.

Aloy is a very charismatic character and while the story develops you learn with her what happened with this land based by robotic animals, a script that pretty much could set a sci-fi movie.

Rather than spin a story about naive tribes battling the evils of encroaching technology, this game had the gut to weave a tale that encompasses complex themes. A mature storytelling that we don't always see, it addresses abandonment issues, ethnic cleansing and touch on things we usually face as a modern society.

As far as the gameplay goes, it's pleasant how fluid it is, the mechanics of the combat are intuitive and at the same time it gives a healthy challange in which we cannot always relay on just one weapon through the whole game.

During the game you realize that sometimes it's best to switch your fighting style between stealh and agressive, you need to figure out how to beat each machine's attack pattern, capabilities and weaknesses to get a successful outcome without failing in the process or even dying. Extremely rewarding but progressivly tougher the longer you get into the storyline which in itself is very driven.

The game offers us a large amount of side-missions, collectibles and challenges around the world to complete, if you are a completionist get ready to a deep run that will consume your time for several hours.

To wrap it up, very recommended. An exciting journey from the very start that leaves us with lots of interesting questions all while the development of Aloy as a person happens, what it means for her future trying to uncover the truths about this strange world.
When most of them are finally answered there's yet much to come.

Worth mention that it came very chaotic to PC but nowadays it runs great, a good addition to your library if you like adventure games.

As someone who never play any Sony's developed and published games in the last decade or more. I would say this is a great game. For a game that classified as an "RPG" game, this game is not too complex. So anyone can hop in and enjoying the game, the scenery, and the story. No Microtransaction and no 3rd party DRM like Denuvo, etc. It looks like they treat their PC customers better than some big game publisher out there (looking at you Ubisoft, etc).

Compare the game performance at PC launch vs now, it's like night and day. At PC launch the game performance was so bad, but after several patches now the game run smoother than before.

Detailed Review :
Pros :
+ Beautiful Graphic and scenery.
+ Beautiful Bushes
+ Fairly good story
+ Good Gameplay
+ Built in Photo Mode
+ And Thank God, no microtranscation at all. And the resources for upgrading is not so scarce. ( Take a note Ubisoft )
+ No Overkill 3rd party DRM like Denuvo, VMProtect, etc ( Again, take a note Ubisoft. It's so weird when one of the console maker not using any multilayer of DRM and treat their PC customers so well and better than Ubisoft )

Cons :
- Abysmal performance at launch or should I say bad port? . But after several patches, for me the game way lot smoother and better than before.
- Weird camera placement. I can't describe it perfectly, but something like this : Sometimes Aloy would shift from left side of the screen to the right side of the screen and vice versa when you wander around the world like sprinting, etc.

Informational :
- Because I said earlier "this game is not too complex", so there is no multiple ending like most any recent RPG Open World games.

Recommend this game.
8.8/10

It seems like most of the bugs that people complained about at launch have been dealt with. Only crash I had was because I was running an old video card driver, It runs smoothly and looks amazing. I have it on the PS4 and finished it, but always wished to play it on PC.

Performance is terrible, process lingers after closing.
Even following people's quality settings for good performance I'm still getting terrible results.
Lots of pop-ins, constant stutters (especially in cutscenes) and crashing in gameplay.

*Update 8/19/20* Working now - some visual glitches, but it hasn't crashed yet.

Game looks great - but its crashing in the first 5 minutes of actual gameplay, I cant seem to get past the first room. i9-10900k, 1080ti - latest drivers. Lower settings seems to add some stability - but its still crashing pretty frequently.

Might be best to wait for a patch.

I'll update this review if/when it is fixed (hopefully very soon)

PS: Latest version is very stable and smooth, no issue here

I bought this game on PS4 originally when it came out, and had a great time playing it. Since then, Sony has shifted focus to putting their original exclusive titles on PC after launch.

This game in particular has had a bumpy start with hardware compatibility issues, however it's worth noting that they have patched 4 times already since launch, and the game is more stable and better performing each time.

On my particular hardware setup, the game runs very smoothly. I have a relatively high end PC (9900k, 2070 S) but my friend who uses this game from my library (Yay steam sharing on this game!) has a lower end but very common PC (Some I7, GTX 1660) and it also runs great on his machine post updates! So for anyone who was worrying if the hardware was in the way, I think it's very safe to say most rigs now should be able to run without crashing or severe performance issues!

And outside of hardware, the game is a gem for the start of a series. It definitely has it's own issues, cheese dialogue, weird hand made facial animations (no mocap for realism) kind of gives it an uncanny valley feeling. These were just some of the issues with this being an original title and the developers only having so much time and budget.

But the gameplay is fantastic, killing and hunting giant robots is a blast regardless. They keep getting stronger, but so do you. And the main story is an interesting engagement with the idea of radicalized corporatism, letting companies and their technologies evolve to a point of no return. That idea isn't new on its own; however the way it's explored in Horizon: Zero Dawn is entirely unique. Worth a shot at any price, for open world lovers looking for a cool series to get involved in.

Happy hunting.

Epic game, Epic and interesting story. This game kinda look like Tomb Raider+The Witcher's combine for me :D Also,it has a bit optimization problem.

just an amazing game and such very strong lovable main character. You can run all the time but when I hear her panting or out of breath.... It makes me stop and just walk normally for a bit....Takes longer to get there but just feel the need to give the girl a break.... weird I know.... but that's how great the writing and characterization of Aloy and all the other NPC are :) love this game soo much :)

DAMN! What a fantastic game it is. It has incredible visuals, unique plot, and mind blowing gameplay. Soundtrack is a masterpiece in itself. It was an incredible pleasure to complete this game and continue exploring all of the mysteries, side quests, missions, and so much more!

Totally Worth 10/10 :D

Looking forward to the release of Horizon Forbidden West on steam store :)

UPDATE (08-12-2020)

This game is one of the best action RPG's to date. I've finished the game on PS4. It has great graphics, very cool story and the setting is very creative and memorable.

At release the game was plagued with technical issues like Stutters, frame pacing problems, Crashes. At that time I could not give the game a positive review. Today patch 1.09 arrived and the game plays a lot better.

I'm now able to play this game at 4k Ultra on a 3090 on a C9 Oled. The game runs beautifully and has steady framerate between 70 and 90 fps.

If you like a story driven adventure with light RPG elements and action oriented gameplay than this is the game for you. Don't expect any deep RPG mechanics. You have a skill tree and in the end you will have all skills unlocked. There is a variety in armors and weapons. The main story is great and memorable. You'll finish it within 25 hours.

ORIGINAL REVIEW (RELEASE)

Let me say that this is one of the best action RPG's to date. I've finished the game on PS4. It has great graphics, very cool story and the setting is very creative and memorable.

That being said; I unfortunately can't recommend the game in its current state for PC. The game is plagued with stutters, frame drops, bad frame pacing and a very rough playing experience.

I'm playing on high-end hardware (2080ti, 9900k, LG C9 TV) on 4k with g-sync enabled and still experience very bad stutters. I've adjusted the image quality settings to recommended settings and even lowered the resolution to 1440p. I've also made sure the pci-e bandwidth is 20 Gbps.

In my experience this is a great game, but has a very bad port. I know the devs are working to get things fixed. But right now it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The game should not have been released in it's current state.

Wait a couple of months and check back if the game is fixed. Time will tell...

At this state, the game is unplayable for me. Constant stutters, low fps and crashes. Unfortunate, since i really was excited to play this for the first time since everyone says its good. Asked for a refund, may buy in the future again if they manage to fix their optimization problems.

UPDATE: For anyone wondering my specs are Ryzen 3600, GTX 1070, MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon Ac, 16 GB 3200mhz RAM.
I ran this game at high settings at 1440p getting around 45fps. The fps is not the problem (even though it IS low and badly optimized, especially compared to Death Stranding running with the same engine), its the optimization. The game crashed 3 times, stuttered about every 30seconds and even more in gameplay. It ruins the immersion. Just not worth the money IMO.

If you've ever wanted to blow up giant robot dinosaur things with primitive weaponry, this is probably the game for you.

Simply an amazing game. The storyline is intriguing enough to make you want to follow it, and the world itself is full enough that aimlessly wandering through it is fun and often satisfying in its own rite. The variety of weapons allows you to cater much of the game to your play style, whether you prefer to sneak and snipe, run in with guns (or, I guess, arrows) blazing, or use traps to ambush your enemies (although you'll probably do all that and more).

The variety of enemies is pretty great. There are several human bandit types that you'll need to kill, but for the most part you'll be fighting various machines, mostly designed with inspiration from the animal kingdom. Each 'species' behaves in its own way, which can lead the way to some really creative combat styles, making the journey both challenging and fun.

Otherwise, the game on a whole is beautifully designed. The landscapes, people, and machines are all fantastically rendered. It's not a difficult thing to get lost wandering the land, whether you're en route to a mission, scouring for resources, or hunting down machines ...or rabbits. The variety of landscapes is pretty unrealistic, as your character can walk from a jungle area to a forest and then an icy tundra in a matter of minutes, but that variety keeps the settings from growing repetitive, and at least for myself, helps to give a sense of where in this world I'm wandering without needing to keep going back and forth to the map.

The story is pretty good (so far), and provides a pretty good set up to explain why humans are living in this sort of primitive world surrounded by deadly technology.

I just got the game and whatever performance issues were there before are gone. I've got a GTX 1070 and can get 50 frames at 1440p, High Settings. And also the game is good, but you probably already knew that.

Horizon Zero Dawn is, for the most part, a solid, middle-of-the-road, generic open-world action-adventure game. It is perfectly competent in basically all areas, but doesn't really do much to innovate or stand out from the extremely crowded, extremely saturated field of generic open-world action-adventure games. Thankfully, it is saved by its one actual innovation: fighting giant robot animals using bows.

HZD does an excellent job of making the robots feel threatening and dangerous at every stage of the game, no matter how high your level or how powerful your equipment, while still making them feel like surmountable challenges that can be overcome with tactics and cunning. Obviously, blindly firing arrows at robots will do next to nothing, even with the best bows in the game, and you will find yourself getting smacked around like a giant cat toy. First, you will need to scan a new robot type while staying hidden to learn where all their weak points are, whether it be optic cameras, batteries or fuel canisters. Often, these parts will be protected by armour plating, which you will have to first remove by shooting them with armour-stripping arrows. Then, you will need to shoot at the exposed area to deal critical damage to the robot. If you use the correct ammo type, such as flaming arrows for fuel canisters or electrified arrows for batteries, you can cause elemental explosions which will damage all nearby robots, which will be useful if you are hunting multiple robots at once. If you are able to ambush a robot, you might be able to set up tripwires ahead of time to damage or stun robots. If a robot is too mobile to deal with, you can use harpoon ropes to anchor them to the spot. In all scenarios, there is always an element of strategy and finesse when hunting robots, and you never feel like you're trivialising the game with sheer firepower. Every encounter with a robot, even when doing mundane things like farming components for weapon upgrades, feels fun and exciting.

If there's one thing to criticise about the bow combat system, it's the lack of evolution in weapons as the game progresses. Very early on in the game, you gain the ability to craft the starter form of every ranged weapon in the game: three different types of bow, crossbow, slingshot etc. At that point, you basically have every combat option you will get in the game. You can get upgraded bows which deal more damage and can use more elemental arrows, but 90% of using elemental arrows is just "shoot arrow type A at weakpoint type A," so your experience in using these weapons basically remains unchanged for the entire game. This is alleviated somewhat in the DLC story, which allows you to unlock 4 new weapon types that function completely differently than your other weapons, but the DLC is targeted at a pretty high level, so you will still go through most of the game with the same few weapons.

As for why there are highly advanced robot animals in a post-apocalyptic world of primitive humans in the first place, HZD does a surprisingly excellent job with its plot and worldbuilding. The story of HZD is well-written and well-paced, first starting small with the protagonist Aloy wondering about her mysterious origins and trying to save her tribe, then gradually expanding to learning about the origins of the current state of the world they live in and trying to save the entire world. The game could have very easily shrugged its shoulders and said "we're giving you freaking ROBOT DINOSAURS with freaking LASER BEAMS on their heads, are you really going to question where they came from" and most people would have been perfectly understanding, but instead they chose to craft a rich, believable setting in which to populate all manner of mechanical beasts.

However, while the plot of the game is consistently good throughout, the same cannot be said for the character writing. Thankfully, the important characters are all done well: father figure is fatherly, mysterious ally is mysterious, antagonist is a constant insufferable ♥♥♥♥, and Aloy herself is a sympathetic protagonist. However, almost every other NPC in the game is a flat cardboard sign meant to point you towards your next objective and disappear forever. This is the kind of game story that you will find more fun diving into in a fan wiki than actually playing reading about in game.

Unfortunately, that is where the accolades for this game end. Everything else in HZD is painfully generic open-world filler content. You got your three fighting styles of ranged, melee and stealth, where melee and stealth are painfully underbaked compared to the game's bow combat. You got your bandit camps scattered around the map to liberate, populated entirely by human enemies, which are so much more boring to fight compared to robot sabertooth tigers. You got your Uncharted-style traversal system, where you can only climb on special yellow-coloured rocks and ledges and it's really just a glorified linear path, which feels so dated and restricted now that we've experienced BotW's freeform stamina-based climbing system. You even have grinding random forest critters to farm drops to craft new weapons, which feels so extremely lame and out-of-place when compared to hunting down a giant robot crocodile to extract a machine core. It feels like a lot of these were added to the game because they couldn't think of anything better to pad the game out with and they decided to go with what everyone else is doing, instead of truly making design decisions to support a truly wonderful core gameplay hook of hunting bus-sized killer machines with caveman tools.

Overall, Horizon Zero Dawn is a good game. I don't want my criticisms of it to detract from that fact. However, it is certainly not the second coming of Jesus that the hype surrounding the game would have you believe. Everything that makes this game unique is a truly shining experience, but unfortunately everything else is painfully generic and fails to help the good stuff reach its full potential.

In Short
Great choice for every RPG fan. Memorable game. Worth the original price. If you find it on sale, don't delay and enjoy the ride!

Positives
+ EXCELLENT post-apocalyptic world. Mix of prehistoric age and sci-fi. Diverse beautiful biomes ranging from deserts to snowy mountains with many breathtaking views. There are several human tribes which are well established and have a fair share of history with each other. These tribes struggle to survive in a world filled with machines. The thing that impressed me the most is the connection to the old world (before the apocalypse). It's not there just as a filler. It plays an important role in the story and gives many good reasons for how the world developed. I struggle to remember any other game, or even movie/TV show, where I would appreciate flashbacks as much as here. The world-building is definitely strong with this one and it even manages to carry other parts of the game.

+ Good story. It starts slow with more focus on prehistoric aspect, Aloy (main character) and her tribe. Later it shifts to sci-fi and focus is on the past, present and future of the world and Aloy's place/part in it. Aloy is an outcast fighting against all odds and trying to find out about her family past. It's cheesy sometimes. It feels like a generic story you have seen a few times before. However, later you discover how she fits the overall story of the world and it gets very interesting. The second half of the game where many secrets, twists and connections are revealed/explained is AMAZING.

+ The map size is just about right. No vast empty spaces or spaces filled with meaningless sh*t. Imagine AC game level of icons and halve the amount. IMO developers hit the sweet spot with amount of collectibles and side content. Good middle ground between story driven and open world design.

+ I loved the combat and TBH it raises my expectations of combat systems going forward. There is some stealth and melee combat, with fast/strong attack, stealth executions, hiding spots and whistle - but it has a minor role. This is mainly ranged game done right. Most of the time, you fight machines aka 'robotic dinos'. There are about 30 well-designed types of machines (get hyped for likes of Onyx, Zapdos, T-rex, etc.) with various strengths, weaknesses, weak spots, attacks and abilities. Your knowledge about them is key (yes, read the damn 'bestiary'). Combat is always fresh because you fight something ACTUALLY different all the time. In order to fight these various enemies, Aloy acquires about 12 or so different weapon types throughout the game (with different ammo types). Emphasize on different. You NEED to analyze the situation and use correct combination of tools for different enemies. You will feel the pushback if you play sloppy.

Machines can ACTUALLY be dealt with in different ways because of its components and your weapons/tools. And I mean it, you won't cruise through the game with just one bow type. I used regularly all three types of bow and 4 other weapons (two types of slings, tripcaster for traps and ropecaster). And these have different ammo types (usually 3) and yes, you switch between them all the time too. Moreover, there is other fancy and more weird stuff like flamethrower, lightning gun, ice gun etc. if that is your thing. This is very different from Witcher or AC games where you can spec one (best) way and beat it all, repeating the same sh*t over and over without any motivation to ever change anything.

Overall, you need to exploit weaknesses and minimize strengths of the enemy. Preparation is important. No headless running in and smashing keyboard. No infinite health bars of generic enemies. You will get destroyed. The game is hard to learn, but also rewarding. It makes you think and use different tools in your arsenal. You will feel good when you see your progress and efficiency fighting each type of enemy improve over time. Enemies also become improved after some kill count, which is nice detail.

Min-maxing in the game is limited. You can't really 'outgear' the game difficulty. There are stat limits. You can optimize, but in the end, it will be about your decisions and actions. I would suggest to start on very hard (UH wasn't even in the game at release) and switch to ultra hard later (there are some functional changes in addition to number increases).

After 130h in HZD I decided to go back to AC:Odyssey where I had 240h already. A game which I had mathematically beaten because my gear is so min-maxed beyond the difficulty curve it's not even funny. I can spam left click and use 2 abilities over and over to beat ANYTHING in the game. Close to no pushback. Just mindless gameplay. Same 3 to 8 not so different enemy types. No motivation to change playstyle or even weapons I use. It was a stark contrast to HZD. I just laughed in despair.

+ Great DLC (Frozen Wilds). Definitely worth it. Beautiful snowy region (even better than the base game), great new weapons, decent story for a DLC, great side quests and interesting characters. Good (read as challenging) new enemy types.

Negatives
- On PC you will see issues with AA and grass. Game has lots of flora and it makes TAA choke. If you have DLSS, just enable it and enjoy. Otherwise, accept that you will see shimmering. Don't use FSR 1.0 (even more shimmering) - the performance increase is big, but your eyes will bleed out.

- Some areas feel out-dated: facial animations (the usual), water surfaces and climbing system.

- The inventory management is kinda ass. You can upgrade up to 120 capacity, but it's not a safe amount by any means and there is no stash (which would fix the issue). In my experience, even after going through reddit and guides, I was constantly at 100 to 110 load leaving only small space left for new items. The game has a crafting system with materials and lots of "trophies" from enemies you collect, basically you should keep a lot of stuff. Then there is stuff you can sell, no problem. Being a responsible and organized person myself, I still had issues with clearing the inventory and being comfortable.

- No transmog. It's not such a loss, but still.

- There are two main villains (generally speaking). One is very interesting, the other is... let's say under-developed.

Nitpicking
- Aloy is not a Mary Sue character. She is not perfect and makes mistakes. No worries there. She is however, presented as 'the chosen one' archetype (there is even story explanation for it). Just a warning if that's not your thing.
- As mentioned, melee combat and stealth plays only small part. It's not an issue as the ranged combat is excellent, but be aware.
- There are 3 options in dialogues (heart, brain, fist) which is basically good/neutral/evil Aloy response. I don't really like this approach because of AC:Odyssey. Luckily, these choices are occasional in HZD and you don't have to choose every 5 seconds. In case you think these choices have impact on story - they don't. This game doesn't have multiple endings.
- Controversy alert. The final battle at the end is nothing to write home about. Everything leading up to the end is AMAZING, and then you get the final battle in the one place of the whole game where the age of the game is showing and you get two mediocre/straightforward boss fights. OTOH you can have companions you helped throughout the game assist you in the battle (similar to Witcher 3) and Aloy has hilarious sassy callback line in the first boss fight. And of course, nice emotional ending cinematic to save it. I'm torn on this.
- There is override and mount feature (riding machines, yay!) and it's useless because you get everywhere by foot, no problem (vast network of travel points too). But hey, more options for the player, thumbs up.
- Combat with human enemies is basically reduced to stealth executions or headshots. But who cares. The game is about fighting machines.

Earth is ours no more

2020 has been quite a year for video-games, we got a new Half-Life entry, a Persona game launched on PC since 1996 and we got the announcement of a Sony’s 1st Party flagship coming to PC, Horizon Zero Dawn. Truth be told, it’s not the first Sony exclusive game to come to Steam, we also got the Quantic Dream games and recently Death Stranding but none published by themselves, now Horizon is a completely different case, it’s their first published game on Steam and who knows, maybe the first of many, anyway, the day has come and it’s time to review this adventure, so let’s find out if it’s worthy, shall we?

Horizon Zero Dawn takes place in a distant future in which civilization has returned to the tribal era, the world has returned to a natural state and it’s populated by mechanical beasts, the machines. We play as Aloy, an outcast girl who wants to discover who’s her mother and why she is an outcast, her quest for the truth will lead Aloy into something much bigger that involves what happened to the world in the past and what’s happening between the tribes in the present. What happened to our world? That’s something we will find out.

The story is really interesting, it gives you two perspectives, the first one is the present tribal time in which we will see how the society works in such conditions. Religious vision, political movements, social behaviours, all those elements will be present all the way until the end of our adventure.
The Second perspective is the past, what happened to the world, why there are cities in ruins, why there are machines ruling the lands and not only big things but also we will see little fragments of the daily life of that society via documents, holograms and audio logs, don’t miss them, some are really good and there’s a lot of background content in this optional files.

As the story is divided in two main arcs with their own mission timeline and both can be merged due to the freedom of choice when it comes to choose what mission you want to do I think I should give an advice about how I think it’s the best way of experimenting the story, the first arc you should do is the one that it’s about the present () until the end of it and then go all-in to the arc that it’s about the past () as this will lead to the end and by how it is structured in terms of dialogues and choices, I think this makes more sense, the frozen wilds should be experimented after the main story for the same reason, dialogues and references make more sense.

Game has a lot of side-quests, they provide a good chunk of exposition about more details of the present and there are some worthy characters that will be found in this side-activities (hunting grounds, infected zones, etc), make no mistake, not everything is worth it and the map is full of marks, while it’s not difficult to complete the side objectives, it is time consuming and maybe it’s not something you want to do, if you want to focus on the important ones, follow the green exclamation marks once you discover them, there are side-stories that are really interesting.

Side-activities will unlock more points to get more abilities and get better parts to get better gear, it’s not something mandatory but I think it’s enjoyable thanks to the gameplay.

Speaking of gameplay, there’s a lot to discuss here, let’s see, base gameplay is what you would expect from a third person action/adventure game, everything is as standard as you can imagine, however, it works really well, climbing is guided but very fluid,combat is functional, etc... however the only playable system that feels strange compared to other similar games is riding the machines, it feels clunky and I guess they wanted to make it feel heavy because, well, you are riding a mechanical horse and not an organic animal but I don’t think it makes you feel that but that it’s a non-functional riding.

Now returning to the combat there’s this thing that makes it something stunning, machine hunting. Combat against humans is the standard, melee and distance attacks, however their actions make them predictable so it’s easy to win their encounters, machines tho, while predictable they offer a much higher challenge in combat and it’s spectacular and a big part of what makes this game something unique, if there’s titanic beings combat in it, there’s already something special.

Thunderjaw’s first combat is something remarkable.

There’s no better way than that combat to introduce the graphics as yes, both the Thunderjaw and Horizon Zero Dawn are juggernauts, but a different kind of juggernaut, one is an alpha predator in the game and the other is top tier in terms of visual quality.

HZD is probably one of the best looking games out there, a general look of the valley, the snowy mountains or the warm desert will make you say “woah” every single time you discover a new location, the lightning, the weather system, the forests and jungles and the ruins, everything looks absolutely fantastic, let’s keep in mind that this game came out in 2017, the fact that this can compete visually against more modern titles tells a lot in favor of this game, and not only in terms of world building but also in terms of character design, which is absolutely fantastic, aside of some weird animations from time to time when it’s time to talk, but overall it’s impossible to say this is not a good looking game and if you find it as one of the most beautiful games you have seen, well, I can feel you.

Even the little details are present, sure, it’s not a world as reactive as we are used to see nowadays but 3 years can make a huge difference.
Make no mistake, there are rough textures, some weird invisible walls and a few other little things that will be there but overall, I don’t think you will notice.

What I’m sure you will notice is the sound design too because it’s really great and the most impressive part of it is the machine sounds, so industrial, so metallic, I love it. Human voices are also really great and well integrated.

OST is really good, there are two or three themes that will stick with you for a long time, I’m sure.

And now that I have more or less expressed my opinion about the general aspects of the game, I think it’s important to jump into the PC specifics, aka, the PC port.

Horizon Zero Dawn launched in a very mixed state, while I had a really great experience in my system with no crashes or technical problems present during my adventure, I know I’m the exception and not the rule, in general a lot of people have been experiencing technical problems like stuttering or crashes and it’s something that must be acknowledged, even if you look for specific configurations performance there’s no warranty that it will run at the same quality as your installed programs might be interacting with the game too or some driver is different, I will say it pretty clear, while my experience was perfect I can’t assure you that you will have my same luck.

However looking at the bright side, Guerrilla is doing a really great job communicating with users and fixing with patches all the problems they find, it’s Sony’s first game on PC so I will give you the benefit of the doubt and give them time to learn, at the very least, they have been quite active for the fixing and the communication, so that’s something great.

And that’s pretty much it, my final thoughts is that this is an amazing game that will give you a lot of hours to explore and a really interesting story to follow, the machines are an absolutely main reason to get into this game. It still feels kind of surreal that we are able to play this on Steam but industry has changed a lot lately so anything is possible, I guess.

I just can say that I absolutely recommend this game and I surely hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

TL;DR:
I've finished this game already on my PS4 (both base game and DLC), and i've enjoyed it very much. It has its flaws, but still a solid game, with its own stunning world, lore and everything.


Longer version:
Just finished Forbidden West (sequel), which was great, and thanks to that, I just wanted to replay the first game again, so I bought it (again, i own the original on PS4) on PC, for two reasons - first, to support PlayStation games on Steam, so we would get more of them in the future, and second, was interested in how the game looks on PC, how is it to play it with keyboard. And I am not disappointed. I still prefer gamepad (PS4 dualshock connected to PC), but playing it with keyboard was also fine. I can imagine PC players will be satisfied, but I switched it from keyboard/mouse to PS4 controller, as it's connected to my PC anyway, and I am just used to it now. Many things are more natural for me, as I was recently playing sequel, and the controls are basically the same. Also, I love additional vibrations as a feedback, which is kinda missing with keyboard :) But that's just me, my aim is now quite perfect with controller, but there were times that I wasn't so confident and preferred keyboard :) And as I said, the game is just fine with keyboard.

Main story is great, nothing completely groundbreaking, but all the stories and the whole world around it, it is just amazing :) I loved the idea since first trailer, I was confident enough to pre-order the collector's edition, and it was great. It is still great. I definitely recommend this game to anybody. Many ways to customize your experience, to tweak the settings, many difficulty settings, so you can either just enjoy the story, or just have the biggest challenge ever. This version comes with the DLC, which is nice added bonus, but for me the DLC wasn't that good. But can still satisfy the need for more gameplay, more robo-monsters and everything, as it has it's own story, which is continuation of Aloy's quest (kinda) :)

Fights are the main part of this game, and it shows. Most of the enemies are those robo-monsters. There are various versions of them, every monster is different and requires different approach. It's just fun to discover what works against them and what's the best weapon for them. Many outfits and weapons will help you on your way. Interesting side quests, many characters (friendly or not) with their personalities, lot of secrets to find about the world, which may not be for everybody, but if you enjoy that kind of stuff, then it's there :)

Soundtrack is beautiful, fits the story and the world perfectly, and as a soundtrack/music lover, I was really satisfied :) Voice acting is great, but as I said, unfortunately animations could be better, which might ruin some moments.

Really looking for some flaws/cons, but there aren't that many. Probably just as I said earlier, if you played the sequel, then this game is just downgraded version of it. And graphics + animations and face expressions are just worse than in the sequel, but you will probably notice that even without playing sequel. Other than that, minor glitches can occurr here and there. And be careful, once you fall in love with the world, you may end up buying PlayStation 5 just to play the Forbidden West :)

I usually dont write reviews before finishing the game but now the game have crashed for the second time in the middle of mission and Im really pissed.
The game itself is a really admirable action adventure with nice RPG elements and its one of the most unique experiences in 8th generation ( Not a masterpiece of course ) but PC version is a total disaster even worse than RDR2 and i hope to see updates soon.

Excellent game. It's a great blend of Witcher III, Fallout, and Monster Hunter. Engaging story, challenging and rewarding combat, good graphics (even on my dated card w/ some settings turned down) and open world to boot. 5 stars.

I played Horizon Zero Dawn at a point where the many other open world games I've played (BotW, Witcher III, etc.) are a little more faded in my memory. In that space I certainly enjoyed this game, but I also simultaneously don't have much more interest in the sequel, or even finishing out the DLC. It's good fun for it's playtime, but the characters are boring and don't live up to the absolutely bonkers premise. Similarly, as someone who tends to side quest to the ends of the earth, I spent most of the game overpowered for most missions. So, if you're looking for the best of the best, I'd look elsewhere, but if you want something fun for 50 hours or so, go for it.

Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the best story games I know, I just love the story and the gameplay is extremely good.
The combat system is way better than you can imagine!
The game also has beautiful graphics ^^.
The DLC is good too, you get a lot of overpowered weapons. I played the DLC first before finishing the main story, that made everything easier xD.
But there is one thing I hate in video games, I hate it when you can't continue playing after the main story, but only before the final mission.
I'm really looking forward to the next game. I can only recommend the game to everyone :D.

Editing this review, as promised:

Willing to give this a positive review now. I think performance still perhaps isn't what it should be for the port, and I have experienced 2 crashes since coming back to it after the Feb. patch, but for the most part the game is playable now.

And it is a pretty great game. To be honest I don't think it is quite the masterpiece some people make it out to be, but making open world games like this with an engaging story is incredibly difficult, and H:ZD is very distinctive, plus for the most part does what it sets out to do very well.

I'm giving all the credit for the game's now playable state to the original devs, Guerrilla. As far as I can tell, seems like they have done all the heavy lifting for fixing the port that the porting company neglected with QA. Blame for the sorry state the game was in at release falls more on Sony and the hired porting company, Virtuous.

(Yes I am aware that Guerrilla is a Sony owned studio. I don't think it's too much of a stretch though to assume that the deal/contracting for the port happened at the executive level with Sony. I doubt that the actually people who dev'd had much say or even work toward the port before release, especially since they have their own future games in development and were not being explicitly paid to do the port)

I still hope Sony learns from the experience though and ports Bloodbourne.

This is a game that I originally finished on PS4 before the DLC existed, I finished it again on PC, but this time around I also got through the expansion. It's a very good looking game considering its age, and I'm really into the combat where you need to tear off certain parts of the enemies to weaken them, what threw me off a bit where the characters, the lip-sync and animations in dialogue section needs more polish in my opinion. It also ran very poorly on the first months on the PC, but there are already improvements with the patches they released, hopefully if we get the second one it runs better on day one, but I'm glad that's on PC and I hope that we get more PlayStation exclusives next year, the mouse and keyboard controls made aiming a LOT better for me in this game.

I have been waiting for the next Skyrim for 10 years. Since Bethesda doesn't want to continue the Elders Scrolls with a RPG and I'm no MMORPG player, I was out of luck.
Horizon Zero Dawn is absolutely gorgeous and great fun to play. That a console port would be my next Skyrim is nothing I would have bet on. But here we are, with a great port that's playable with keyboard and mouse, has great gfxs and plenty of lore and storyline to feel just like the good old days with an 2021 update.

Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version:

Buy this game if:

+ You're interested in open world games, where the main missions are the core of the gameplay and narrative rather rather than its secondary side quests;
+ you want to live in a post apocalyptic, "witcher-esque" gameplay
+ You have a good gaming pc;
+ You're interested in a challenge and you can bear some resource hunting;

Don't buy the game if those above points won't hold for you;

Verdict: 8 not including the PC port part in my rating but including the DLC: Frozen Wilds // 6,5 otherwise

Time required to finish the main game: 20/25 hours
Time required to complete it at 100%: around 65 hours (depending on luck, game performance and patience)

Longer version:
Let's see now the most important points, including the DLC, described in the end:

1) THE PC PORT: everyone had his own unique experience with it, personally with a i7-8700 CPU,16GB of RAM and a NVIDIA GEFORCE 960, i had to put all the settings on low, having as a result 45 stable FPS outside and stable 60 on closed areas and bunkers. Never had game breaking bugs or glitches, except when skipping through dialogues, weirdly enough. This was my experience, i'm not a tech expert so take it as it is.

2) SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF THE DIFFICULTY SETTINGS and overall good progressing:


HZD 1 
A Screenshot of Horizon Zero Dawn
By: Flipper Is A Dolphin


The game progression is stable and you'll rarely feel out of place or underleveled at the normal difficulty settings, raising up the difficulty bar though could be a good call, as the enemies' pattern and behaviour will change and widen a lot, really making you feel the vibe that a huntress should have during a deadly combat and really pushing the scavenging and machine hunting;

3) GOOD GAMEPLAY AND NARRATIVE during the main quests:


HZD3

The main quests are always important and fun, forcing you to explore a vast and thriving world, witnessing the changing inside Aloy- the main character- outside her and her tribe. Sadly the secondary missions, except a few ones don't offer that much in terms of being memorable and original, as the narrative during these quests is mostly carried through 1 to 1 conversations where the camera shifts abruptly from one talker to the other, lessing the narrative immersion and depth.

4) THE FROZEN WILDS DLC IS A MASTERPIECE:


HZD2 
A Screenshot of Horizon Zero Dawn
By: Flipper Is A Dolphin


The DLC is extremely good as:
1- changes the way the narrative progresses;
2- the side characters you'll meet are unique and remarkable;
3- the new added enemies are a good challenge and they're tough to be dealt with (and fun!)
4- adds several weapons and upgrades which help diversifying the combat and the overall experience
5- introduces a new entire skill tree
6- the main story of the DLC is deep and well intertwined with the story and the dialogues in the end part of the base game;

5) THE COMBAT GAMEPLAY IS EXCELLENT AND FLUID:
even with my not optimal perfomance described above, fighting machines always feels fresh and compelling, as trying different strategies and approaches will always grant you good gameplay diversity and different loot from time to time, allowing also Aloy to improve her inventory and ammo capacity

Thanks for reading and for bearing up with me, leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations, have an amazing day/night, feel free to follow my other reviews at: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32344423/

Love this game! Lot's to see lot's to do. Everything about this game is top-notch from the storyline to the graphics. If you like to explore this game is for you. The game's combat is a lot of fun. The stealth mode...hiding in tall grass and luring and killing enemies reminds me of playing Sniper Elite 4. In fact, this game is kind of a cross between Sniper Elite 4, The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, and the Tomb Raider games all rolled into one. This game gets 5 Stars.

you know those games where at first look you have zero interest but completely win you over? yeah, this is one of those games. I would have never of played this had it not come to pc and steam, so shout out to sony for releasing it on the platform. It feels best with a mouse and keyboard to the point where im blown away this wasnt designed for mouse aim. the art style is kinda brilliant, the dinosaur machines are insanely detailed. I give this game a heavy recommendation.

FINALLY! We got this incredible title on PC, so WHEN are we getting "Ghost of Tsushima" and the other cool titles?

I mean come on! Masterpiece exclusives like this one should be allowed to exist in the library of EVERY passionate PC gamer out there!


Now then - while mocked in late 2020 as being more like "Horizon Zero Optimization", as of now (January 2021), it's WAY better than even "Cyberpunk 2077" on so many levels!

Just ignore all the reviews written BEFORE January 2021 because there were some optimization issues but they have been fixed.

And as for the game itself, well...it's just - simply - AMAZING! The story, the graphics, the music, the setting, the mechanics, everything...just..."clicks". It's pure awesomeness. Period.


00110010 00110000/10 - Would fight primitive Skynet again.



EDIT:

This game has literally one of the best and most unique stories ever told!


EDIT #2:

Forgot to mention this - STOP IT with the console exclusives already and be smart for a change! By releasing games on PC as well, you'll have A LOT more customers and therefore A HUGE increase in revenue!

More platforms = more players = more purchases = more money, and everyone would benefit from this win-win situation. It's a no-brainer!

Requires SIGNIFICANT performance and bug fixes. Do not purchase until then.

Game is fun, engaging. Combat is entertaining and the story hooks you if you enjoy Science fiction.

good game, but why they need so much data collection only for fixing bug for future updates then forces me to accept it?

To be honest, Horizon: Zero Dawn (HZD) was nowhere as good as the people were saying, and if I’m to count hits and misses, it missed a lot more marks than it hit. So why the thumbs up then? It’s simple, really, because where it hit, it absolutely nailed it!


Pros:
Combat has to be the best in any open world (OW) game I’ve ever played
Graphics are breathtaking
Story was alright

Cons:
No exploration whatsoever. Just follow the map/compass icons
Upgrades, trading, and some crafting rely on randomized loot
Voices are compressed, and it’s pretty obvious
Side quests are all pretty generic chores and offer no unique rewards
Mounts are terrible
Some bugs here and there


A wonderful world with absolutely nothing to find in it
The first disappointment that became evident very early on, was the absolute lack of exploration. Considering that HZD is an OW game, I was hoping for at least some sense of adventure and player-driven exploration. It has none of that. You will never stumble upon something that wasn’t already marked on the map and has to be found by exploration or deduction. I did all of the side-quests and collected every single collectible, simply by going from one map-marker to another.

The world of Horizon: Zero Dawn is full of breathtaking vistas

It means that there are no hidden items that you can find by exploring the world or following some sort of clue.
This is a huge missed opportunity as the world of HZD is beautiful. These are some of the best graphics that I’ve seen in a video game, and I’ve got screenshots to back that claim. Making the game a bit more about exploration, removing the lazy quest/item markers from the map, and replacing them with landmarks would encourage the player to look around and get absorbed in the wonderful world of HZD.

Oh and for the love of God, rework your mount controls, Guerilla. They’re atrocious! Whoever thought that it’s a good idea to do them this way made a terrible decision.


Random loot based progression with awful inventory system
Considering the amount of available gear, the randomized upgrade system is worse than it would normally be, as you’ll need to get upgrades for multiple gear pieces. These items are something that you can have in your inventory at all times. Simply open it up and switch your loadout at any given time – even during combat! This is why I’m confused why the devs didn’t think of some convenient way to swap between different loadouts on the fly. In fact, the entire UI is full of missed opportunities.

For example, why force us to go through a tubular inventory when picking items when there is a weapon wheel already in the game? Why not allow us to sort the items in the inventory, and include filters and search criteria in a game with 120 items in a single item category? Why couldn’t we get a comparison of the currently equipped item/upgrade versus the one that we’re highlighting? Why split equipping and modifying items into two separate inventory categories instead of just making a separate key for equipping and another one for modification of the selected item? These decisions make no sense, and it feels like the game was rushed.


Other than for the story fillers, side-quests are hardly worth your time
All of the side-quests are uninspiring. They come down to going from point A to point B and defeating the enemies that you find there. Sometimes you have to use your Focus gadget to follow the tracks or examine the surroundings for clues, but ultimately, they’re all the same in form.

To make matters worse, the only reward you will get from pretty much all of these quests (except one if I remember correctly) is a bit of XP and a loot-box containing random items that you can get or buy elsewhere.

The only thing that’s somewhat good about them is the extra lore that they all provide. We get to learn more about the world, factions, and machines through these quest stories so, if that’s something you care about, you might actually like them.

Combat is just fantastic
This single-handedly makes HZD a game worth picking up and playing through, and thankfully there's tons of it. It’s so good that I found it hard to let the game go until I’ve beaten it, and then started and finished another playthrough.

I’m sure you’ve seen footage of large, robotic beasts and how Aloy uses her bow to hunt and defeat them. They come in different shapes and sizes, from horses and rams that you can mount to a freaking raptors and basically T-Rex! While all of them are machines, they all require different approach to combat/hunt. The more you play and the more unique enemies you encounter, the better hunter you’ll become.

From prey to apex predator. Aloy has a tool for every situation 
A Screenshot of Horizon Zero Dawn
By: geøstigma

First off, there are numerous types of damage in this game. For example, Tear will deal less damage but will rip off parts of the machine more easily, like armor plating or its weapons. Once you do that, you can use its own weapon to hit it where it hurts the most, deal some massive damage and make short work of the otherwise deadly foe.

Then there are more specific weapons like the Ropecaster which is used to ensnare the machine and pinpoint it to the ground, allowing you to lob a couple of sticky grenades onto its vulnerable spot before it picks itself up.

Tripcasters make (elemental) traps, which can be used to prepare the terrain when you go up against some of the more dangerous foes. Aim and shoot two anchor points, and the weapon will make a rope between those two. Once tripped, it can trigger a simple booby-trap or exploit one of your enemies' elemental weaknesses - setting them ablaze or stunning them. Depending on the enemy and the situation, you might want to use one or the other.

There are also traps that you may place for extra advantage and control in a battle. Corruption arrows can make machines go berserk and attack everyone around them for a short time. Special elemental weapons similar to a flamethrower or its siblings of a different elemental affinity, Tearblast cannon, Rattler, and even more, but let's stop here.


So what about the story?
I actually liked it quite a bit and cared to see it through to the end. The overall presentation made it great, and the unique post-apocalyptic setting was rather refreshing to play in.

I did not read all of the logs that I found throughout the game, as most of those seemed irrelevant to the game or were some code excerpts. The main story, side-quest, and NPC dialogues were good enough to keep me going.

The part that could use quite a bit of improvement is character development, as there’s basically none of it. This isn’t a problem for me, but the game does offer you to speak in different tones on specific plot points, and it is implied that, depending on your choices, Aloy’s personality will also change. This turned out not to be the case. It is definitely not an RPG as it is stated by Steam tags, but an action-adventure with very minimal character progression, no character development, and a pretty basic level-up system, so keep that in mind.


Should you get it?
If you’re still unsure, here's what I’d boil it down to:
If dynamic, creative, and (potentially) challenging gameplay, with an original setting and an interesting story is what you value in a game, then definitely get Zero Dawn.
If you’re looking for an RPG game with a world to explore and adventures to be had above else, definitely skip it, as you’ll find none of that here.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a post-apocalyptic open-world RPG where you kill a bunch of machines and evil henchmen on your way to saving what remains of humanity.

Pros:
The graphics are beautiful.
The story line is fairly decent and has a very unique setting.
There is a fairly in-depth and explained historical background for the setting (though it requires some suspension of disbelief as it uses fantasy science).
It has an interesting and versatile combat system that is easy to pick up and difficult to master.
There is minimal to no grinding required.
It truly is an open-world game as you can basically go everywhere with minimal story line progression required.

Neutral:
I honestly cannot recall the background music for this game. So it clearly was not particularly memorable (neither for good nor bad reasons).
Available array of weapons was pretty bland and uninteresting. Upgrades/customization of said weaponry was also just unexciting (though still useful).
The DLC was not particularly interesting (more of the same stuff) but it did come with some new weapons, armor, and powerful new versions of existing weapons.

Cons:
The characters are rather boring - I honestly did not find any of the actual characters to be interesting and instead was more intrigued by the dead historical characters.
The combat grows stale after a while (like 20-30 hours in, combat was more of a chore than anything particularly difficult or interesting).
While this game is an RPG... it only fits that category very very loosely. The choices presented to the main character are basically inconsequential.
Side quests are repetitive, boring, unoriginal, and any other synonyms of the aforementioned.
Mounts are seriously limited and suck. With so many cool machines, you are limited to three very banal mounts (and none of them can fly).
Achievements require you to beat NG+, which is literally the same thing as NG except with better weapons available. Moreover, one of the achievements requires you to beat it on Ultra Hard (regardless of if you had beaten NG on Ultra Hard), making it even more of a chore.

Verdict:
Horizon Zero Dawn is a good game. I would be lying if I said that this game was anything spectacular, however I would also be lying if I did not admit that this game was a pretty fun journey overall. I recommend playing this game casually and at a reasonably quick pace rather than trying to do everything available (as the game will quickly feel repetitive after 20-30 hours). Essentially, if you play HZD at a casual pace while focusing primarily on the story, it is actually a really enjoyable adventure. However, if you try to finish everything (e.g. all achievements), the game will feel like a slow grind. I would 100% recommend getting this game if it goes on sale. Otherwise, you may want to consider what you are looking for in a game before you spend $50 on HZD.

Thank You

Let me start by saying "Thank You", to all those involved in delivering this game, you should all be proud of yourselves. The story, the unique interpretation of the world, the atmosphere, demonstrate your commitment, that you poured your soul into this one.

Actual Review

In this game you will play as Aloy, a curious young female who's been outcast by her tribe and finds shelter to another outcast, Rost, who will serve as her mentor and protector. After a big event, Aloy embarks into an adventure to find more about her origins and the truths of the world.
In the quest for truth, Aloy will have to face malicious humans and machines, with a spear and a bow as her main weapons. Some enemies may be too strong to face head-on, so Aloy will have to think of ways to wear out her enemies, before landing the finishing blow. As the story progresses, Aloy will be adding more situational weapons into her arsenal, that will add more depth into her combat ability.
During her journey, Aloy will have to make some choices, to show empathy (heart), be rational (brain) or aggressive (fist) in a situation. Her choices shape some responses, but no achievement or completion related events hinge upon particular options.

At the time of the review, I have completed the main game, along with the DLC ('The Frozen Wilds'), which is already included and does not need to be purchased separately.

This game is recommended for people that enjoy Action-Adventure games, and want to experience a unique interpretation of how the world may look in the distant future, accompanied by a fantastic story telling.

Tips

1. Do not enter the DLC zone (the snowy area in the north-east corner of the map) before having met a certain character named Sylens in person
2. You need to explicitly finish a NG+ run on Ultra Hard to unlock the achievements:
- New Game+ Completed
- Ultra Hard Completed
- All achievements obtained
so play whichever difficulty you fancy for the first run (I'd recommend Normal)
3. Always scan the area around you to find any possible secrets / items, they will be handy
4. Even though the Side Quests, the Errands and the additional content from the DLC are not required to complete the main story, they have helped me to get a better grasp of the world Aloy is surviving in
5. In case you play on Linux, use Proton Experimental, in my 80 hours gameplay, I didn't have a single issue

This has the most invasive data collection scheme I've ever come across in a game. The so -called limited version tracks every website you visit, every app you open, every video you watch. And there is no complete opt-out anywhere. Getting your money when you buy the game apparently isn't enough anymore, they're basically selling you spyware so they can sell your data to third parties. Seeing as Days Gone seems to have the same policy I'm never buying a Sony published game again.

Horizon Zero Dawn is captivating, stunning, and a great ride.

Why you may ask, is it captivating?

It’s all about the story of Aloy. From the beginning you are drawn in and it keeps you intrigued and wanting to discover more...The character creation is in-depth, and well developed. A female protagonist character that has a personality and strength with no bounds that you can weave by the choices you make.

Why you may ask, is it stunning?

Visually it is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. Its right up there with Red dead in graphics, but more than just that, the attention to details and the creativity of the atmosphere and environments, is simply superb. As a person who loves to take screen shots, this game had me snapping shots like a tourist every new place I went.

Why you may ask, is it such a great ride?

The game play, IS SO MUCH FUN! So many weapon choices, so you can be creative in how you want to take things down. If you want to be stealthy and ninja kill things, you can. Or you can set traps and bombs, and watch as things go down without much of a fight. You can even find a safe spot and sniper things from a far. You can even do a little of all above, whatever you enjoy. Although like in any game, certain areas or story may require specific methods.
I recommend this game without a doubt!

Had a great time with it. Has some of the most gorgeous graphics i've seen in a game and a very intriguing storyline that keeps you fascinated till the end. Though the side quests could have used the same love since most of them can feel a bit samey.

As for combat, it's amazing when you get used to it. The sense of scale and rush you feel when fighting some of the machines is just incredible. It was easily the strongest point of the game. But the combat against humans could use some work.

The soundtrack is nice and voice work is solid too. Also really enjoyed the Frozen Wilds expansion and thought it was a great improvement on the base game.

Took me around 80+ hours to 100% the game and loved every second of it. Definitely a must play if you love single player open world games.

Solid 8.5/10.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a great game.

+Graphics(it really looks great)
+Gameplay
+Story(really good)
+Open World(the map is really big and you have something to explore)
+RPG
+Music
+Pleasant atmosphere


Horizon Zero Dawn is a combination of Far Cry and
Assassin's Creed and offers a perfect balance, good story a great world to explore and good gameplay easy to learn.

10/10 Must Play I recommend buying it at a discount or at full price, it is worth every penny.

And I'm very glad that this wonderful game came on PC as well.

Pros

-Beautiful Landscape, a destroyed decayed but beautiful paradise, from Snowy peeks, to tropical forests this world is beautiful from every angle, a stellar world design.
-Every Side mission feels unique, they all tell a different story, few fetch quests.
-Vantage points, these offer windows (literally) into the past showing a location before the setting of HZD, a lovely glimps into 'what was', Love this feature!
-Audio Logs, similar to The other collectables, offer viewpoints from previous ages past in good detail to really bring the world and lore to life.
-Crafting, quite a large focus of this exploration focused action/rpg, is finding resources out in the world to make bombs, traps, upgrades to help you survive in open world.
-Amazing Machine Designs, taking inspiration from real life animals mostly Jurassic/ Post, Really great designs and all feel Unique posing different challenges.
-Machines have armour plating which can be targeted to cause critical damage, these dynamically break and fall off as the battle continues, changing up the way you approach situations.
-Aloy reacts to different weather conditions and how she feels about it, a nice detail. When looting a downed enemy, parts and scrap are removed from the corpse visually.
-Photo-mode, always a great feature and as an avid screen-shotter myself extra points for this, though the camera movement could be improved, not as fluid as Ac Origins.
-As you clear corrupted zones, the weather effect changes in the region from a grey to colour, (not unlike the saboteur actually), nice detail.
-New Game + Mode which offers more weapons, gear and face paint unlocks as well as custom focus colours.


Cons

-Facial animations are capped at 30fps or at least perform under this code rule-set, often bugging out making for some, at times, odd moments.
-Eyes again seem to bug out above 30fps, moving wildly 'darting' as if a seizure might be coming on, not a good look especially breaking immersion.
-Hair has un-realistic physics (Think Assassin's Creed Unity) it just doesn't look like hair but paper, or a feather.
-Both Human Ai & Machine Ai can often bug out (Pathing mainly), sometimes failing to notice you at all or sometimes seeing you across the map, very inconsistent.
-Challenge Hunts often place other enemy types that get in the way of your hunt, messing up your times, poor design here, though a nice idea it's poorly executed.
-Stealth against human enemies flat-out doesn't work at times, often being seen behind rocks from 300 metres. Bad detection script here, assassin's creed & Splinter Cell did it better.
-Side missions wont show up on the map unless you walk within 100 or so metres of them, meaning you 'Could' miss some if you don't check the wiki.
-Snow Deformation doesn't work as intended, as the only item to work with snow deformation is The shield weaver outfit. (This could be fixed in a future patch)
-Not enough Weapon variation, and no legendary end-game weapons (not really anyway) would expect it with the Rpg mechanic Rng style.


Summery

Horizon zero dawn is a mixture of genres, an action 'Rpg' at heart with hunting mechanics and hack n' slash elements (targeting weak points etc).
It brings to mind memories of a couple of titles, 'Enslaved Odyssey to the West' in the post apocalyptic green and lush scenery, with destroyed buildings, parkour elements.
'Recore' an indie game with an action exploration setting, in a post apocalyptic setting, this time featuring machines not unlike HZD.
A great variety of enemies each with their own fighting styles, special powers and tactics, playing on ultra hard, the beginning is very tough, as cliche as it is, Dark souls would be a good example.
Even the weakest enemies can 1-2 hit you, until you start gearing up mid-game, after this + abilities you will soon be able to master your own techniques and styles for taking on each enemy.
One thing i do wish had more options was melee, you will only get 1 item, The spear with 1 mod slot to upgrade slightly (1 final one at end game that is more upgraded),
this to me isn't enough, especially on ultra-hard the spear doesn't do enough raw damage in open combat to be a viable option (in terms of larger enemies), though one can use it in stealth mode, as well as critical hits to do a little bit of damage.
Once you have the war bow, or power bow, with 3 arrow abilities, you wont be up and personal as much as early game i find, as it just does so much damage that its a bit of a handicap, in some ways not that it's a bad thing as it's still a lot of fun.
The graphics of HZD while demanding (often more than i would like, on a 2080ti getting under 50fps on medium/ultra) can look downright amazing, considering this is technically still from 2017.
The inclusion of the Photo-mode is a + though i would have liked a bit more fluidity with the camera as it seems to be locked to Aloy's player-model which isn't ideal.
The Hunting Lodge Club is a great set of side quests if a little short, would have loved it to have been a bigger focus in the narrative.
The world building in HDZ is flawless, the variety of Biomes (different atmospheres, weather patters, locations and temperatures. However, they fail to truly make a 'lived in' feel regarding NPC's and how they have an effect on the world itself. Animations while good, aren't varied enough, say compared to an assassin's creed game which offers 100's of full animation sets and activities tied to Npc's, so they feel like they are doing something at all times.
Here they will often just stand around doing pretty much nothing, (some do have custom animation sets but mostly not). If they worked on this for the sequel then i think the world would feel more alive and greatly benefit from it!

The Frozen Wilds DLC Summery

The side quests are very well written, all a blast to play, each offering small stories and extensive detail in each, branching off into their own little adventures with writing to boot.
I found myself often getting distracted planning on getting to an area, then forgetting about it for 3 hours and remembering i was going somewhere, this often happens in the base game too, just thought i'd mention it hear.
The story takes you up north 'beyond the wall', To the tribe of the Banuk, a fearless tribe of warriors, (some found in the base game).
The Dlc takes place in the real world location of Yellowstone national park, they have done a great job recreating the landmarks here, just like the base game.
IT gives more information and lore about the world of HZD, fleshing out these details with more audio logs, following the 'firebreak project' of the old world which links to the main story of frozen wilds. This really reminds me a bit of the fallout style narrative.


Overall horizon zero dawn is Lovely Game full of funny moments,a great location combined with both Primitive & futuristic themes which offers a great experience from start to finish, in mission or free roam and would highly recommend, even with its flaws it really has a lot to be commended for.


Time Played

Main Story: 35 Hours

Horizon: Zero Dawn is the living proof that you can make a great game if you have a great story, great writer and great designers. People can and will overlook even the most crazy and frustrating decisions of the game, if you have a spark of greatness in your game. Horizon: Zero Dawn has many great moments and even greater frustrations.

You will stay for two things in this game:

A) The visuals: Sometimes the visuals means artstyle, sometimes it means graphics. This time it means both. HZD is a beautiful game with great, realistic graphics, amazing models and great textures. The art style is also great. From snowy mountains to deserts, from the different types of machines, the cities and the plains, everything feels alive in this game and you will be immersed from the first moment you'll play.

B) The story. And what a story it is. It's structurally a masterpiece. You'll focus on the story of Aloy, a young huntress who is determined to find out about her ancestry. Simple. In this quest you'll discover gradually that her story is bigger than she was expecting, and bit by bit you will uncover the bigger picture that fills the gap of the lore of the world, plus you will take down the evil cult that wants to kill you. It feels a bit generic, but it does many things right: 1) the main quest is memorable and it has a lot of "wow" moments. 2) Great characters: the villains are a bit underutilized but other characters like Aloy, Sylens, Rost, Erend shine like diamonds. 3) the lore of the world is exceptional and it feels engaging.

Still the game has A TON of bad choices that will frustrated you. I wanted several times to quit but my will to see the story, made me pull through:

A) Over-aggro machines. I know it's intended, but it sucks in 2 major ways: First, the travelling of the world feels bad because you are constantly attacked by random packs of machines that roam the roads. So instead of going from A to B, you will be going from A to killing machines and from there to B. Secondly and most importantly, these over-aggro machines hinder your battle. Let's say you want to take out a big machine. You attack it but in doing so you alert EVERY machine in a radius of a hundred meters, so most of these battles end up in a clusterf@#$.

B) Bad levelgating: In addition to the above, sometimes you will aggro enemies that are way above your level. I just wanted to kill some scrappers and more times than none I ended up dying to a thunderjaw. Or the other time that a quest was indicated as a level 20, and the enemy inside was level 27.

C) Attrocious level tree: Level trees are about powering up and unlocking cool abilities, right? Well not in HZD. Here you will unlock the very basics like "stealth kill" or "have a mount". That's right. You have to spend 9 level points to just have a permanent mount. Or be able to strike from above. or to have more room in your inventory. Also Fast travel in this game is not free. You need resources or you will need to buy a certain item from a vendor.

D) Gear: The gear is bad because there is a small variety of it, just a couple of weapons and armor in uncommon, rare and epic. Nor the machines nor the humans drop armor as a loot which is strange, but fine. The problem is that the armor is exclusively found in vendors, which are paid in both currency and in resources, so if you want to have a better armor (as I late found in the game) you have to start taking hunting seriously.

E) Some bad combat mechanics; First the big machines (like thunderjaws and behemoths) are calibrated badly. They are huge, do a ton of damage, but also are insanely fast, like you can never outrun them in a battle and they can reach you in just a jump. Actually their animations are so fast, that even with the time-slow movement you will often miss because they move faster than the projectile.

Still HZD is great game despite the flaws I find. And I believe that this shows how great a game must be, if I am willing to overlook all these flaws that could be easily be avoided.

A brilliant game with amazing graphics. I must admit i was a little apprehensive when it came to buying it as only 67% of people recommended buying it.. but that number is now 69% it seems to be rising every day. I dont regret it for a moment. Admittedly i do have a high spec laptop with a 2070 graphics card and 32GB ram. It runs beautifully. I am unsure what the reason is people dont like the game.. but it seems very good.. So far i have played for 3.8 hours and feel like i could play for 38 more easily!!

Edit 22.8 Hours played and i am really enjoying the gameplay it is an open world with a main quest and lots of side quests to choose from. The graphics just blow me away i am so impressed..This is the first time i have enjoyed a game so much in a long time! There are many different options of gameplay when you first start playing.. whether you want to mainly focus on on the story.. whether you want to play easy.. medium, hard etc. When you first load the game it sets the game to your computer specs.. which are recommended but you can change these.. i havent yet though!!.

I haven't suffered no problems gameplay wise, no errors etc. 88% of reviews in the last 30 days are positive and 71% in total. I would serious recommend this game to anyone. This is the first time i have done a review in such detail.

Completed the main game last night i really enjoyed it, it was truly amazing, the gameplay and the graphics everything is just really good. I have yet to play the Expansion pack and i have only completed about 2/3s of the achievements. I havent completed a game in a long time but this game really pulled me in! I would recommend this game to anyone.

People seem to have problems with this game if they start playing with the recommended settings.. graphics etc.. i havent changed any of the settings from the original ones the "computer" chose from me right at the beginning.. and everything has worked perfectly.. no bugs or glitches.. I am looking forward to playing the expansion.

A majestic ride into a future where we're a memory and source of superstition, where nature is the main character and hunt is rewarding. There is a sense of greatness in all this, and covers some falws like Aloy's exagerate perfection or some stuttering and glitches here and there. I understand why this game is so praised. Just beware, this adventure is not an easy one, and you'll have to be strong and patient to survive. Can't wait for the sequel to arrive to PC.

This game has changed my life in a very hard time in my life, that I do thank this game for getting me back into gaming.

The story of this game is beyond epic like LOTR, Zelda and many other games that influence it
Aloy is a strong protagonist that has a lot of new things of her backstory that has not been done before, lots of subjects, and thought provoking things that are involved in this game.


The gameplay is very strong, RPG mechanics just like BOTW or similar too it, tight, engaging and the leveling system is just easy to use when you want to get upgrades.

Honestly, I am glad that I invested the time and money for my new PC build to experience this game thats one of a kind.

Truly an amazing experience that I would never forget from start to finish.

Thank you Horizon Zero Dawn.

Really great game! The world is so beautiful. I really enjoyed exploring it through and through.

Pros:
- The combat takes some time to get used to, but once leveling up "Silent Strike" (one shot kill small enemies in stealth) early game, I found the game more enjoyable. While the early game has less combat options, I found that levelling up skills really made a difference and opened up so many options as the game went on.
- The beautiful world has huge variety - from snowy lands to deserts to lush jungles - not a moment felt boring while traversing.
- Learning the enemies' weak spots is incredibly important and really fun. The variety of enemies made me try out different tactics and bows. There's actually a reason to try out almost all the types of weapons and ammo types.

Good to know:
- The 2020 Steam launch seems to have had some bugs or crashes; I played in 2022 so it was 100% smooth for me, no issues and the game ran super smoothly.
- There's a while in the early/mid-game main story quest that I felt had a slow pace which made me a bit bored for a while. But the story really picked up after and got me even more engaged than before! I think the late game quests were all worth it.
- I feel that the stealth options were sometimes lacking, so it was hard for me to play in pure stealth, which I had wanted to sometimes. But perhaps it was due to early game lack of upgrades; I found myself getting mobbed less after getting more stealth upgrades.

Overall really enjoyed my time with this game - the exploration never had a boring moment, and while the early / mid-game quests had some slower pace, the late game quests really made up for it.

To start: Take the role of an outcast in a world where primitive tribes survive against rampaging machines.

The Positives
+ An impressive third-person action RPG in a post-apocalyptic setting with robot T-rexes.
+ The environments are stunning, biomes ranging from tundra to desert, with photo mode at the ready.
+ Strong female lead done right, defined by her strength and capabilities rather than physical attributes.
+ Combat is unique when it comes to the machines, nothing more satisfying than whittling them down by shooting off their individual components.
+ Enemies increase in size and difficulty at a gratifying pace, Aloy also getting stronger by unlocking new skills and obtaining new gear.
+ Wonderful, thought-provoking story, despite elements that are familiar in the science fiction genre.
+ Worldbuilding at its finest, depicting humans in a believable way (worshipping gods that don’t exist, splitting into separate tribes and fighting each other, etc).
+ Phenomenal soundtrack that fits perfectly with the theme.
+ The Frozen Wilds is a solid expansion with new enemies, stories, skills, as well as the most powerful weapons in the game.

The Negatives
- Open World Syndrome isn’t especially egregious, but there’s still bloat and meaningless content to distract from the rather short main questline.
- Consistent hand-holding that’s all too common in open world games, where the player is treated like they’re incompetent (an example being that Aloy will often comment on what to do / where to go).
- Forgettable characters apart from a select few, BUT a nice detail is the NPCs that Aloy helps throughout show up at the final battle. If their quests aren't completed, they don't show.

To end: Released on PC three years after console launch. Top-tier even with its flaws. Opinions are my own and reflect my experience. Full review can be found at Leviathan Libraries.

Horizon Zero Dawn

First of all, don't get me wrong. It's a great game and well worth playing. Sony has managed to create one of the best and most memorable main characters in video game history. And certainly one of the the best female protagonist out there. Aloy is strong, intelligent, and kind. And has the right background to explain her epic skills in combat and survival. Not like some other female protagonist we all know. With abilities no human should have and that are never explained or those remembered mostly for their boobs.
But for this review, I will mainly focus on the game's bad side. And there's plenty of that in the game.

Concept:

Let's tackle the elephant in the room. HZD uses the typical Ubisoft formula. They've used it so many times in Far Cry and their hundreds of Assassin's Creed games. Square used the same formula with the new Tomb Raider series and the Thief game. And now Sony used it with Horizon Zero Dawn. In itself it's nothing bad. But if you've played any of these games, you've pretty much seen it all.
You have your main quest line, which takes around 5-6 hours if that's what you focus on mostly. And the rest is filled with all sorts of random things to artificially blow up playtime. Random loot you'll never really need unless you go on random animal and machine hunts, random vistas, random lore, random and repetitive side quests, random NPCs you'll never see again, random bandit camps, etc. That's a lot of random. It's enjoyable at first, but the more you play, you relize it just drags on and on and on.
And all the random lore pieces in the world don't help at all. Because most of the time it's about something very trivial. No explanation about the world you live in or how the tribes build their things and their society, how the tribes themselves evolved so differently besides living so close to each other. It's a story telling mess and all over the place. So much potential lost.

So you have about 5-7 hours for the main quest and about 60-70 hours of random stuff. That's 10-15% on the essential and world building and the rest is just random. I'm pretty sure some people will like this kind of concept for some crazy reason, but when you think of some of the greatest games of all time, you just have to be disappointed. In these games you have the complete opposite. You have 80 percent and more time to grapple with the story, the concept, and all the little things about the world you're playing in, and the rest are things that don't matter that much to the bigger picture.

Main story:

The main story is solid. Nothing new or unique. Nothing you haven't seen, read or heard. But it has a decent pacing, and just enough uniqueness to stand out from the rest. But there are no surprises and you will know everything in the middle of the main quest. Or even before that. Overall, the dialogues are not very well written and pretty basic at times.
That might sound a little harsh, but they ended up wasting 60 hours on random things instead of deepening the main story with a few more NPCs and lore. And it's not like the NPCs on the main path are very interesting either, apart from the main character and the "other" main character (I think you know who I mean). All others are very generic and interchangeable. You'll realize how basic everything is when you just rush a new game + for the achievements. I did this in 5 hours and I have no regrets missing out on any of the random things the game has to offer.


Honourable mention:

And besides how simple and straight forward the game already is, they really have implemented a hand holding system from start to the very end of the game. Why? Just why? Do they really think gamers are just stupid and need constant advice not to get lost? I mean, it's ok in the beginning, but later it gets extremely annoying.
You have to follow tracks but you will never lose them as they are highlighted like a Christmas tree in the evening. There is always a waypoint marker that points directly to the next quest step. There are almost 200 campfires (fast travel points and checkpoints) on the map, so you don't have to walk more than 50 meters. 200 of them! And Aloy is constantly commenting on things as you fight or walk around to remind you of the right path and tactics for specific enemies.
So, come on! Have a little faith in your customers. There are not deranged and certainly don't need constant guidance to beat your game. Do that!, Go there! I mean seriously!

And before I forget. The AI ​​is really, really bad. Especially for the machines, but also for humans.


Conclusion:

Those critics aside, the game is a wonderful pastime. But just don't expect any depth or great worldbuilding. It's wonderful for a first playthrough and maybe a second time for the story in a few years. But mostly I'm just disappointed with the lost potential and how bloated the game is. If you remove all that random stuff, you'll see that there just isn't much left.
But that's a problem of our time and people seemed content with this kind of games. Don't think much, don't ask much, just a time filler. Like a typical Hollywood action movie. You watch it and forget everything about it as soon as you leave the cinema. It's just not my thing. But stunning graphics and audio don't belie a thin concept and weak writting.

Personal Score: 8/10

Ps.: Here's just a reminder. I was just talking about the bad stuff here. Because everything else has already been discussed many times. Graphics, audio, combat, weapons and the various elementals, mods, DLC are mostly top notch.

the game forces you to sign off on a privacy policy that tracks the websites you visit and such. how is that nessessary or appropriate for a single player game to have on you? the audacity of these publishers man i swear. no respect for the consumers privacy. all so they can make money off of your data. i'm not cool with that so i just issued a refund

I've been playing it for over 40 hours and by that time I experienced only 2 crashes. Sadly though this came to an end at 42.4 hours. Loaded my savefile, and within the minute of gameplay it crashed. it kept happening. Then, the game would crash on the loading screen, then the game crashes on the main menu, and now it even crashes steam with it too. Got all of the patches till 1.05, tried all fixes, but nothing.Am sorry, it brakes my heart since I was having a great time, but I cannot recommend this without knowing that it won't happen to you.

Played everyday since the release day on Steam and not a single crash like others have been experiencing. I have some frame drops when you are going through new areas mostly inside the Cauldrons. Aside from that I really enjoyed playing the game.

I finished the New Game on Very Hard Difficulty because I don't like the vendor price increase in Ultra Hard. Then I did NG+ Ultra Hard Difficulty. The difficulty is fair enough and not that hard. But the vendor increase price in Ultra Hard is so unreasonable, if it weren't for that I would go straight NG UH. The story and combat mechanics of the enemies are pretty good. I had a lot of fun fighting all of them especially the ones in the DLC. One thing that I wanna change though is how bright the machines eyes when it is night time. Especially the new machine in the DLC because when they are in front of you, the glare is really bad that you just want to close your eyes.

And speaking of having a hard time to see. If there is weather or it is night time it's pretty hard to see the human enemies. Although I am wondering if this is part of the difficulty design decision. If this is, then it's okay I guess.

Since I played all the Tomb Raider games reboot, some have similar elements from the franchise. Like the campfire save and travel points, resource gathering from wildlife, and plants, and the climbing explorations.

One QoL improvement they should implement on the plant gathering is have a different colored icon. Like when you loot wildlife if they drop higher rarity materials. Although it's easier to identify from afar if a plant is a wood resource, the other plants such as the medicine, shock, fire. etc are hard to differentiate.

Now the campfires, there are lot of campfires around the map. So there are lot of save points and fast travel points you could go to. But some of the campfires have also a respawn point of enemies, that's just pretty stupid design decision imo. Imagine travelling to a certain campfire and as soon as you load there's an enemy there on the campfire.

I am really getting some Tomb Raider vibes while playing the game and exploring the areas. There's one thing I noticed also is Aloy used her spear to pry through some doors just like Lara's climbing axe. I hope we could've expand the use as well of the other weapons to open up certain areas or remove some obstacle along the way.

There are only a few puzzles in this game but they are very easy. Although I like the ones in the DLC. I hope we could have more challenging puzzles on Forbidden West.

Map size and scale is very good design wise. Not so small, not too big. And you have a pretty amount of side quest with good stories to them. Not like other games, especially AC Origins. You have a very large open world map with lots of locations to uncover but they are all the same and boring.

Dialogue scenes, One thing I noticed about dialogue views is they aren't dynamic to every NPCs. The game have a specifc amount of different camera views of dialogue and used in all of the dialogues. Also the pose of a downed/dying NPC when you are talking to them. They have all the same pose. They could improve this in Forbidden West having dynamic camera views on every NPC dialogue. Different poses of downed NPCs depending on how they are injured. Adding more personality to NPC when they are talking not just the head animations.


100% Completion! Forbidden West here we go!!!!

I guess that's all I could say. I really recommend the game, especially now that you could see the devs are really doing they can to fix the crashes of some people are experiencing. One more thing that they should've added are Ray Tracing Settings and DLSS. Because Death Stranding have this on PC right? and they both have the same engine. If this was included in the PC Port it would've been so sweet. So excited to play Forbidden West on PS5!

My overall rating: 9/10
I voted for the “Outstanding Story-Rich Game” award

Still wouldn't buy a console for this

TL;DR If you love open world action games then buy it. This is open world game done right.

You play as Alloy starting from childhood (which reminded me a little of Witcher 3 intro with Ciri). After a short tutorial Alloy is grown up and ready to uncover the truth setting the foot in a beautiful open world.

The gameplay consists of fighting enemies, doing quests and some other minor stuff.
The world is set far in the future and machines have taken over the world. I love the idea that “ancient world” is portrayed as our world (slightly in the future) and you can see fragments of ancient world which is a bit disturbing when you realize someday our world might look like that and archeologists will dig through the ruins of our skyscrapers.
But the whole idea of the story isn't new, it has been discussed by multiple games and movies. So don't expect a deep story here. But it's well written and you want to play more to find out the truth. I would compare it to a movie, take romance movie for example. There are thousands of movies with the same idea, but some are trash, some are great. So Horizon is the same, idea which has beaten to death presented well.
It takes multiple ideas and puts them together, yeah it's not innovative or very original but it's not a bad thing it's still a good game, taking existing ideas and making a good game out of it requires a lot of talent. Lot of games do the same but they are boring because people making those games just put everything together without any thought or effort. Horizon on the other hand polishes those ideas.

I'd say this game is a blend of some other games. Assassin's Creed, Enslaved and maybe a little of Witcher 3. Although AC has prettier world, their world design, architecture has no equals. Enslaved has better characters. Witcher 3 has better side quests.

Characters are average, including Alloy. I wish there would be more to Alloy. Like having fun in a feast, dancing, falling in love, sitting on the edge of the mountain thinking about existence. Remember Witcher's 3 HoS quest where you visited a feast, the boat scene? This is what I want. Alloy is pretty shallow character. Sure she's tough, helping, determined and a great fighter, but I haven't felt any connection with her.
Same applies to side characters. You get a lengthy dialogue and you hear a little story, learn about the lore and you like the character. But after you do that quest it's over. There were several characters I loved, I wanted quest chains, I wanted to sit with them at the table, maybe play some mini-game. The little stories are great but it just ends and you don't see those characters anymore.

I don't mean to look like i'm bashing the game here. Everything I said here is good, but its just good, not great.
But it has great things too. Combat is amazing. This game has one of the best combat i've ever seen. It's dynamic, fluid, responsive and fast. It never gets boring. There are different machines and multiple ways to beat them. Each machine has its weakpoints. You need to shoot the weakpoints with your bow to do more damage. Some machines are weak to electricity, cold or fire so you choose different arrows. There are also slings which shoot elemental bombs. You can tie machines with ropes and then swing at them with your weapon. You can set traps. You can play stealthy and lure them towards you and override them so they would fight along you. You can use them as mounts. With all these possibilities and a bunch of different machines the combat feels amazing.

Then there's Frozen Wilds location (included DLC) and machines there are much more challenging. I suggest doing the DLC before you finish the main quest. It affects the ending slightly.
Frozen wilds offers new weapons and new characters, you learn more about the lore and story of the region and its people.

The world is filled with Ubisoftish collectibles but it's almost just about the right amount of those. I wish there would be ~20% less. There are vantage points where you learn about an ancient world a bit and can see how it looked back then. Tallneck's which you climb and override which opens up more of the map. And some non-important trash collectibles.

While the combat is fast there's an easy mode so it should be suitable for everyone. You can't win by mashing same button and you will need to move but it's pretty easy to do. Difficulty levels are very flexible and will satisfy everyone. I've played on story mode and played NG+ on ultra hard. The one was easy and the other was extremely challenging. Want to torture yourself? Play on ultra hard from the start.

Graphically it's a beautiful game but a weird one. All the areas and environments look amazing. There are so many details everywhere. The world is beautiful. Trees, other vegetation, snow, machines and people. Machine are especially well detailed. Character models are high quality too, considering it's an open world game with lots of talking the character models are nearly perfect. It's really good game for screenshot lovers, especially with included photo mode which allows you to capture awesome screenshots.
There are a lot of graphics options to tune and great AA implementation.
One thing I found funny that those few pre-rendered cut-scenes look worse than in-game ones. Clearly captured on a console.
Now the weird parts. First one is minor issue but I found it weird that you don't always leave footprints on the snow (in non-frozen wilds areas). At first I thought maybe it's by design but then I noticed that sometimes footprints appear. And the moment I realized it's a glitch/bug was when I needed to follow an NPC and he left footprints and Alloy did not.
Now another one. This game has one of the best facial expressions and animations when you compare it to open world games. Most of the time they're awesome. Not only mouth movement but expressions, wrinkles moving, imperfect teeth, body language. All characters are high quality unlike in AC Origins where minor NPC's have lower quality textures and no facial animations. But sometimes (i'd say ~20%) of the time facial animations in Horizon do not work. You stare at a lifeless face. I thought maybe it's only some characters but it's not. Same character might say one sentence with great animation and then just barely move his mouth. What is even weirder is that Alloy has the worst facial animations in the game.
But overall the game is stunning graphically.

Performance is average. Considering how the game looks it's not bad but it could be better. I played on 3700x, 2070s, 32gb at 3440x1440 and had ~50fps. The good thing is that the framerate is very stable and the whole game felt very smooth. In closed locations fps increased to 60-70 for me.
There's no ultrawide support out of the box. Developers did false advertising saying it will have one. So you will need a simple fix to enable ultrawide support in cut-scenes. But I don't like when developers are lying. Having uw support in gameplay sections in a 3D game with free camera is not a feature.

The sound design is good. Soundtrack may not be memorable but music adds a nice layer of atmosphere. Voice acting is great. From main characters to the most minor ones it sounds enthusiastic and believable. For Fringe fans there's a nice surprise.

Overall a very good open world action game everyone should play. Maybe it lacks originality or character depth but the combat outweighs all the minor negative things.

Pros
Stunning graphics
Very good combat
Beautiful world
Great voice acting
Exploring is fun

This game is a risky move that eventually payed off. Guerrilla, the developer behind killzone, decided to make an open-world RPG for the first time. Knowing this I wasn’t expecting a high-quality open-world game from a developer that had no experience with open-world games. But I couldn’t be more wrong… they nailed it!

The main story is great, not something crazy but it feels like an adventure, and the side missions are interesting for the most part. The combat is fast paced but there is also stealth, with a variety of weapons and modifications to use depending on the situation. I think the strongest attribute of the game is how beautiful the world is, from the snowy mountains to the desert canyons to the green forests, jungles, and more. I almost never fast traveled because of how pretty the game is. And then there is this post-apocalyptic setting with dinosaur-like robots being the main enemies, how can you not like this? Another strong part of the game is its soundtrack, don’t know why but a lot of times I got these goosebumps.

Guerrilla made a bold move and created an amazing RPG. For me, it's a must-play if you like open-world games!

.STOP, IF YOU HAVE ISSUES TRY THESE. (Game has had patches, read game updates If your issue was within the realm of the patches notes, give it another try.)

With that said, I hope many people see this. It's going to be a long one. I could not to get the game to work for several days, and I started some testing to figure out some issues and problems. Ultimately I figured it had something to do with restributional packages, C++ and windows update. Upon doing a complete DDU clean install of my GPU drivers, and manually updating my computer to the current 2004 Windows Update, the game works perfectly, without crashes, without stutters. Allowing comments on this review, if anyone has any questions I'll answer them to the best of the ability of the steps I ran through. My previous Windows 10 version was 1709, make sure you're updated to 2004 ver. If anything, at least try updating to the Win 10 ver 2004 using the media creation tool.

With all that said, the game runs smooth, and now that it works I feel my effort has been rewarded and my eyes stream tears of joy into the depths that is Lord Gabin's wallet. Praise be the sun.

Edit: 0.7 hours when post the review. Currently at several hours in and no issues thus far. Will be posting findings later on in the forum section for the game.

Edit V.2: Aye, the version of windows I was using was the 1709 and wasn't updating to anything past. I manually downloaded the updates until I was at the 1909 update. At this point was then I actually got into the cinematic at the opening of the game. But the graphics were stuttering, or missing entirely. This was when I updated further into the 2004 Win 10 package. There were still roughly the same issues, but at this point it said my GPU drivers were out of date. The next step was use DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) and did a full clean graphics install. Next step I installed C++ items to make sure it was installed. The final piece I did was make sure the .net framework was working properly and installed. To do this you just need to type in Windows Features in your bottom search bar. Click turn windows features on or off, and one of the first things listed is
.Net Framework 3.5 and below was .NET Framework 4.8 Advanced services. Under the 4.8 Framework I only have the TCP Port sharing turned on and the ASP.net 4.8. After which I played through windows update so it auto installed the .NET services and got the computer fully up to date. Loaded the game to see if it worked....And cried tears of joy and proceeded to stay up until 7 am Playing it.

Edit V.3: As a side note to this, it probably won't help everyone, but it might help some along the way in being able to enjoy this awesome game. Probably won't fix everyones issues, but it def fix mine. Last edit will be after a few more hours of gameplay about pros-cons.

Edit V.4: So with all this I did and finally being able to play the game...Here's my take on it.

Edit V.5: Alright, Ive had many people complaining in the comments of section of this, and that's fine, but overly toxic and unhelpful comments are being removed. If it doesn't work for you, just say it doesn't, and give specs. Ill throw the date back to the devs when I can.

Firstly, if you want a game that can give you immersion, feel as if you can connect with the main character then this is def the game for you. They brought her to life on many aspects, whether it be gathering, hunting, getting spotted when out of stealth, taking down targets, and minor choices during dialog/quests/side missions. It was rather well done to give you that connection.

HOWEVER, at the same time the game is so gorgeous that it suffers from a few noticable issues, primarily that of how facial animations translate emotions. Example: Mass effect andromeda was horrible at release because those animations were so elastic or hyper memey to the point it didn't feel like you were in a game at all. GreedFall also suffers from it to a degree, yet still a step up from Andromeda IMO. Those were blocky and sometimes the lips looked more like a fish than any real human could make. I would still say it's a big step up from there. To me it feels as if the game looks and feels good that the face's animations or portrayal of emotion is more set in the tone of voice than the actually characters themselves, or are very nuanced form of interpretation.

Secondly, Gameplay. It feels smooth, very reaction based or by preparing for the fight ahead. You get a plethora of options as far as weapons, some very situational, different types of traps that can be used, still experimenting with how well I enjoy that system.....But Hot sweet baby Jesus did they make the outfits/armor look more stylish than your grandmother going to a modern disco party

Third, Graphics. So I know many are having issues, still having problems with crashes, but with everything I did above and on my end now having no problems (I'm sorry for those stills struggling) It's clean, no stutters, Ultra graphics, even running it on bordless, without any frame loss. Why this is I've no idea. However, sometimes I feel the graphics is dummed down on certain textures such as rocks, like they were smashed together by a 5 year old playing with playdough for the first time?...Maybe? But in other places such as character design, outfits, Enemies, it looks very well down, the Mechs are cleanly made and got some really good glowy bits all around...Sometimes there can be a minor issue with Lights on an enemy called "The Watchers." Occasionally when they spot you it's like the wraith of God Almighty and Zeus have come together to smite the unholy heathen you are for being so technologically incapable, and might aswell be 50 feet away from a quasar with how BRIGHT AS HECK their eyeball beam is.

The game also takes away from a few others as far as certain designs, features, mainly a few of that of Skyrim with how markers work, which bring me to my last point. The biggest downfall and hyper annoyance, (For me) Is I want to say when I open the minimap it's like walking into a homeless shelter that has too much direction. There are markers just about everywhere, more campfires (Fast travel points) that it seems like there is just some random bloke who's a nomand but suffers from narcolepsy so he makes a fire every few feet to ward off the demons in his soul. To me there are just so many points on the map that I wish things were more spread out, maybe the map made bigger to trick me into thinking the place is bigger than it really is? Oh, and tutorials are not done by most normal expectations either. No No my good friends. They are quests with their own reaping rewards, didn't find that out until 16 hours in...So you could technically go through the whole game without even noticing it.

With all that I give this game an 7/10, and that's only because of the hassle that I sacrificed my first born child, gave blood to the blood gods, and purged the heretics out of my computer in order to play this game. As is until patch, unless you're dedicated like me to play this game...Just wait, be patient, or buy it and let it linger in your library until you see the patches being downloaded through your steam.

And if you want a game that will make you feel like you're a toddler with parkisans trying to hold a squirt gun on the hardest difficulty when you barely understand the game. This game is for you, cause I love to not understand ANYTHING about a game and punish myself for the sake of entertainment.

One of the best open-world games I have ever played!
Horizon Zero Dawn is arguably one of the best PC games of 2020.

The Story

It's the 31st century but people live in spiritual tribes. The world had an
apocalypse hundreds of years ago and all knowledge of the "old ones" was lost.
Or was it? There are still huge robotic machines roaming the planet and they
are about to be the cause of Apocalypse on Earth 2.0.

You play as Aloy. A young female who was cast out from her tribe for an unknown reason.
Even worse - A different tribe tries to kill you when Aloy becomes a young adult.
Why was she cast out? Why did the killers want her dead? Are these two things connected
(obviously)?
This and much more is up to you to discover. You must travel the HUGE world of Horizon
Zero Dawn, find buildings of the "Old Ones", learn about the machines and technology of
the past and maybe, just maybe, find out why and how did the apocalypse happen. Prevent
it from happening again and find out why you were cast out and get some well
deserved inner quacking peace.

The game also has lots of side-quests and each of those quests is actually quite fun and feels
like a little side-story. Nothing as great as in The Witcher 3 but still miles (or kilometers)
better than anything Assassin's Creed has tried to sell us as side-quests.


Gameplay

Horizon Zero Dawn is an open-world action platformer that lies about being an RPG.
Now don't get me wrong. I absolutely loved the gameplay and kept hunting machines even
if I didn't have to. It's just that choice making is very very scarce and even then it
barely has any effect on anything at all.

You can earn experience points and level up by slaying machines and men and by doing quests. Each time you gain a level or each time you finish a quest you gain skill points.
Now skill points can be spent on four different skill trees: Prowler, Brave, Forager and
Traveler. Some skill trees focus on melee or ranged combat. Some let you gather more resources and expand your medicine pouches and one skill tree even lets you repair tamed machines (Yes. You can tame machines. Wild, right?).

You can also carry four different weapons with you at all times. Now weapons can be bought, earned, or crafted. There are all sorts of slingshots, bows, and traps to choose from and you actually do have a 5th weapon that can not be equipped or unequipped. It's your spear and you carry it with you all the time. It's your basic default weapon that you use for either melee attacking enemies or overriding them.


Performance

I played on a 50" 4K TV and I have an RTX 2080 Super and the game ran super smooth on 4K resolution, everything on ultra and HDR Rendering on. I've seen some people having issues with the game but I can only talk about my own experience and my experience was awesome. I did experience one crash but I spent over 60 hours in the game and honestly, a crash or two is bound to happen in almost every video game so I guess I can say my experience has been pretty much flawless.

Definitely worth the full price.. In my humble opinion of course.

I'm so in love with this game. The setting is so unique and immersive and I love Aloy as a protagonist so much. The story is quite engaging and I really enjoyed exploring the beautifully crafted open world and its side-quests. It's definitely one of the games you wish you could forget so you can play it again blind. ♥

Overall Comment
3/5 Stars
If you don’t mind potential graphical issues and lower your settings from “ultra”, you can buy it now (patch 1.05); otherwise, you may wanna wait for another patch. I assume they will not make another patch (patch 1.04) that makes it worse again.

Summary
Patch Number	Rating	Comment
1.05	4/5	FPS comes back up to 80+ in ultra-settings, no more game crashing so far, some bugs are fixed, but all those graphical problems in ultra-setting still present. It looks like a better version of patch 1.03.
1.04	0/5	0-25 frame drop, game crash, graphical stuttering and glitching comes back up, in-game FPS lock still greatly affects the performance, in-game v-sync still unstable, other minor bugs, etc
1.03	3/5	better, but still got minor issues running the game in ultra-settings
1.02	1/5	nice try, but STILL crashing at save point
1.01	0/5	still crashing at save point, graphic & performance issues
1.00	-100/5	not able to run the game, stuck in optimization screen, game crashing, and lagging

Funniest Moment
Near the end of the story, when Sylens tells you to “RUN…DON’T FIGHT…RUN…OR YOU WILL DIE…RUN (repeat)”
REMEMBER, THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU KILL THEM ALLLLLLLLLLLLL

Game Strategy
1. AIM THE COREEEEEE
2. HIT AND RUN
3. TRAPS

Problem Solving
Solving Graphic Stuttering Issue:
Change "render scale" from 100% to 90%. In-game v-sync and FPS lock doesn't work properly, you can try on your Nvidia Settings. And remember to restart the game in order to apply the settings.

To improve FPS:
THREE THINGS that matter: Clouds > Reflections > Ambient Occlusion. Try to adjust those settings. Like I said at the beginning, if you try to lower the graphic settings and it doesnt work, it is not your problem. This game has a poor optimization for some models of graphic card and CPU.

Comments
This is my last update on this game. I finished this game at around 80 hours with 6 hours problem solving and testing. Aside from the issues, this is definitely a good game. It’s one of my favorites. It always has an amazing view in the background.

However, I can't ignore all those problems that I experienced. I also can't hide my disappointment with the PC production team. I would rather buy a PS4+Horizon than buy this game on PC. This game worth around $35 to me on PC.

This game was originally released on Feb 28, 2017 on PS4. It supposed to run smoothly on PC in 2020. I’m glad someone can play this game smoothly without any problems, I really do, but this is not my case. I'm running an i7-7700K with a RTX 2080 in 1080p 60Hz monitor. I got a stable 85+ FPS under ultra-graphics setting, but graphical stuttering and game crashing are always the problems. Moreover, I can tell some of the settings are the "trouble makers"; e.g. the FPS lock, the in-game v-sync, etc. This game had terrible optimization when it released. I couldn’t even finish this game without lower the settings and went through all those problem-solving processes. I did a lot of research on google, reddit, steam review, youtube, mod forum, etc.

Anyway, I’m glad there are a bunch of nice gamers around here and reddit to exchange information with me, and they even taught me how to change the settings in order to run the game without crashing. Thank you all!

If I hadn't played Assassin's Creed Odyssey, this one would definitely have been my favourite game.

Overall- 9.5/10
Story - 9/10
-World building and concepts - 10/10
-Side quests - 7/10
Gameplay - 9/10
-Enemy AIs- 10/10
-Combat-9/10
-Inventory management- 4/10
Graphics - 10/10
-optimization and performance - 8/10


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is going to be much more of comparison between the two games (AC Odyssey and HZD) than just the review.
Also, (being dumb) I played game in Ultra Hard difficulty right from start so experience would be slightly different. I would recommend to play it in easy mode to breeze through story instead and then have the real playthrough in full Ultra Hard glory in new game plus. (since last 3 achievements requires it anyways),
Also, I absolutely loved HZD so all the complaints are really the nitpicking. With the world HZD has built I am much more excited about its future games rather than AC series.


Worldbuilding, Characters and Story-
This is where the game really shines. Characters, tribes, side quests are all good enough but the overall concept and just world that is imagined in the game is amazing.



Exploring-
HZD is much more of a survival game- You cannot save from menu, instead have to find nearest campfire. Health depleted is not auto recovered. Your resources are finite (especially in Ultra hard difficulty), gathering them takes some time. And everywhere you go be prepared to be ganged up by ruthless machines.
Well all this does make exploring in the beginning difficult but eventually as you learn about the world it is fun.
I loved the different settings of the world but aside from achievements I didn't feel like exploring each corner (which I did in ACO2).
This is matter of personal taste, HZD's world is filled tight with things, every turn you take you are bound to find something. I prefer ACO2 vast world with lots of open spaces where it felt more rewarding coming across something.
Also, sliding off of edges is big issue and there is always big fall damage. I hope climbing is better in next one as well, I am not big fan of circling a mountain to find the way up or climbing it the SKYRIM way. ​


Combat-
Combat is something which really makes you want to act smart, but at the end of the day I couldn't master that part,
I would much rather just burn the machines down or freeze them to attack. There is scope to try a lot of things to bring down machines with HUGE variety of weapons.
I like bigger machines rather than the ones relying on numbers, I could only really master Thunderjaw whom I love fighting.
Most of it ends up being ranged combat instead and there really isn't much you can do in melee or stealth department.
Overall though this is the aspect I still want to explore more and I think is much too different (and maybe even better) than ACO2. AIs are much smarter in HZD, breaking line of sight won't be enough, stealth won't be easy.
And yes, as everyone keeps saying, fighting humans or camps isn't that much fun.
Ranged- 10/10
Melee- 4/10
Stealth- 1/10
Potion selection controls- 0/10 - It should have been part of quick select menu or similar, there is huge penalty mid fight if you click away from selected potion by mistake.


--Small inventory-
This is my BIG complaint in the game. All the items are kept in same inventory including the resources you need for fighting and rare items that you get.
AND THERE IS NO SECONDARY INVENTORY (like Inns in Witcher1 or Ship in Odyssey).
So even if I have tons of resources I have to get rid of them, only to go grind/gather them again.
OR risk selling of rare items and then just for a small upgrade go searching a freaking Racoon! Same with buying weapons/armors.


Optimization and Graphics-
Though both games are equally pretty, ACO2 worked better for me since I could play it at high settings comfortably, here I had to settle with medium settings.
Not requiring to restart the game if you change settings is great (unlike ACO2). The game still looks pretty even on lowest settings so I liked flexibility of changing settings on the go depending on whether I wanted the fps or prettier world.
Photo mode doesn't have a free camera, instead it centers on Aloy so movement requires a bit of getting used to. But poses and changing time - essentially controlling light angle is great. Good facial expressions would have made it better

so gorgeous

Minor complaints-
-I feel bad killing watchers, they are too cute lol. Sawtooth's limping is too real as well, I feel bad hurting them sometimes (unless they are ganging up on me, in that case death to all of them).
-Wish there was day/night switch like Odyssey.
-Levels are really what decide attack/defense stats rather than weapons/armors. Also, no numbers for them in the selection menu. Stealth stat basically makes you invisible at higher upgrades but there is no invisible suit (like stalkers).
-Skill tree is meh. Additional levelling points go nowhere. (Odyssey was much better at this).


Overall-
A must play game.
Much more of a challenge compared to AC Odyssey and can be played for anywhere from 50 to 300 hours easily.


"Being smart will count for nothing if you don't make the world better. You have to user your smarts to count for something, to serve life, not death.

Easily one of the best open world adventures I played in the last few years.

Amazing gameplay, beautiful graphics, a big open world with lots to do and explore, and a decent story to top it off.

Highly recommended!

This game's strengths come from really unexpected places, namely the wonderful strength and humility of Aloy, and the exceptional writing that reveals itself slowly through the archaeological snippets you locate in the world. The rest of the game is pretty run-of-the-mill 3rd person RPG (if you've played Witcher 3 or Assassins' Creed Odyssey you've played this), but those two aspects - character and story - make the game an instant classic and well worth your time and money.

Aloy is incredible. She's compassionate, stubborn, tenacious and resilient, and takes ♥♥♥♥ from nobody. The choice to make her an outcast is a stroke of genius, it means she has the same flabbergasted and incredulous responses to the world as the player. Because of this, no matter what she does, it doesn't break immersion and fits with her character. The voice acting - by the same person, bizarrely, who voices Tiny Tina in the Borderlands games, is achingly good.

I'm a historian, and I absolutely adore the way the game builds its sense of the past. There's no obvious narrative buried in pieces in shallow graves, there's just endless snippets of pre-apocalyptic life scattered about - advertising, memoirs, trinkets. The way watches and keys show up in your inventory as "bracelets" and "chimes" is deeply endearing, and helps to make the pre-apocalypse material feel more and more alien. I particularly love the way the merchant who collects mugs describes them - a rare treat.

Capping it all off, the character models, while no Red Dead Redemption 2, are incredible and very relatable, and the music is just perfect - mournful but not without purpose, like the world it accompanies.

The combat is the good kind of frustrating - I'm playing on hard and die a lot, but the sense of accomplishment when you, say, shoot the gun off a Ravager and then use it to kill the same Ravager and all its friends, is great. The different damage types take a while to get your head around and are pretty poorly-explained in the game, but once they click you will feel hella badass in fights - exactly how 3rd person games should make you feel! Just make sure to upgrade your gear quickly - otherwise you'll quickly find yourself in grindy fights doing plink damage. There are only three tiers of armour and no level limits, so just buy the best thing you can ASAP.

A word about the port - I have an i7-9700KF, 2070 Super 8GB and 32GB RAM and I run it on Ultra capped at 60fps with no hiccups. Weirdly the benchmark feature had lower framerate than the game, but maybe that's what you want a benchmark feature to do? I experienced some very bad graphics bugs on day one but they were fixed by a driver update. I've have no dramas since.

Just absolutely do yourself a favour and buy this game.

EDIT: I've now finished the game, and experienced a few crashes - one when I and my enemy were both airborne, and two in cutscenes. One of them reset my settings, which was annoying. But on the whole, the port was fine.

Product refunded

I've heard and read many good things about this game and decided to try grabbing it while it was on sale. Immediately after the intro cutscene, I was severely turned off by the list of terms spelled out in their data collection agreement.

It only provides two options: "Limited" or "Full" data collection. You can't opt out. After reading over it a few times, I consider even the Limited option to be providing too much information. They ask for access to much more info than would be needed for a developer to help with troubleshooting or bug fixes for a single-player game.

I looked around for justification and found none, so I felt that I had to conclude that the goal was to gather my (our) data simply to sell it...data that could possibly include identifying info and personal/private activities not related to the game.

I'm aware that I'm already feeding my info to other nefarious companies, though that's mostly out of necessity to live and work in the modern world. It's plain depressing when those invasive fishhooks are embedded in our simple pleasures too. I'm personally uncomfortable allowing a business to pull that level of info from me when they have no use for it aside from selling it.

It's a shame, but I've refunded the game and can't in good conscience recommend it while it sits behind this wall of telemetry. Same goes for any other games that follow the same profit-driven philosophy...data about your personal computer usage is not "trivial" or "useless" and don't let anyone tell you different.

Great game in many ways. Have to appreciate the effort of Guerrilla Games that they spent to develop this amazing game. Combat is always different with all the different enemies and the story is kinda short but very good indeed with the flaw and story telling. there are so many things to do in this game and so many play styles that the game can be played depending the players preference. The Pc port is not the best optimized port obviously but with time they did a very good job of optimizing it. Really looking forward for the Horizon forbidden west

I've not had any off the technical issues others are complaining about and this game is one of the best I've played in a long time. great story, fun combat system and you it really keeps you going with interesting side quests. Definitely a thumbs up and once it gets a few patches for the compatibility issues people are complaining about then I'm sure it will be top marks.

I will keep it as simple as possible, as this review will only contain some technical aspects.

On high settings (the default configuration), I got an average of 70 fps at 1440p (tested on a i7-8700K, RTX 2080 and 32 GB of RAM) and it never crashed. However, I got some frame rate drops here and there, reaching 40-50 fps.

The game is definitely playable, but if you are not in a hurry, maybe you should wait for a patch.

9/10 -- One of the best games I have ever played. Properly in my top 10 games of all time.
A modern open-world classic.

⚠️This review does 𝗡𝗢𝗧 contain spoilers but other reviews might⚠️

I have just completed my first ever playthrough of Horizon Zero Dawn. The game looked beautiful and intriguing to me but I admit I wasn't expecting to like it too much as I really struggle to stay immersed with third-person perspective games, and also this style of game; fire, dodge, role, counterattack, fire, dodge, role... but I realized quickly it's so much more than that.
I was very pleasantly surprised, it's truly fantastic! It is one of the most immersive, jaw-dropping, heartwarming, and moving games I have played.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Story:
The story is truly great and touches on many real-world issues such as where we and the world are heading, what might happen. It's brilliant and there is comfortably 30+ hours of gameplay even if only do the main story and blitz through it quickly. You take your time to explore and do many of the amazing side quests, there is comfortably 100 or 200 hours of gameplay. My first playthrough is 235 hours to 100% it.

• Difficulty:
Sadly, after the first few hours even on ultra-hard difficulty the game does get quite easy. Especially once you start encountering the largest machines and play the Frozen Wilds DLC.
I highly recommend anyone plays on at least one difficulty level higher than you normally would otherwise it may get too easy and boring towards the end. Also, the HUD makes things very easy, and also it can be a little cluttered. Thankfully the settings menu for disabling and tweaking the HUD is really great, you can highly customize it to be disabled most of the time until you need it.
If you're like me and you like a real challenge, you might have to set yourself artificial limitations like not using the strongest weapons or armor to keep it challenging.

• Settings / Menu Options:
This surprised me, for a console port the dev team behind this put a lot of time and effort into accommodating PC players. the amount of customization of the HUD, gameplay elements and tutorials, live representation of graphical settings so you visibly see what the graphics settings change and how it's improved.
I would say it feels like it was made for PC, it doesn't feel like a console port. Huge kudos to the dev team.

• Graphics & Lighting:
The visuals are phenomenal. The world does feel completely open and full of wonder, and a lot of that is due to the visuals. High-res textures are nice but you need a lot more to really captivate and immerse someone in a world. I've never taken so many screenshots of a game in my life and found myself walking at a slow pace around the map just so I could look at the world. Although, I do highly recommend installing a re-shade filter as nighttime is way too bright and so are caves.
The only negative here is recent updates have caused some pop-in issues, but the devs are aware and still actively releasing hotfixes.

• Sound & Music:
Whether the immersive reverb and echoes when in a valley surrounded by mountains, or the metallic binary but still somehow alive and sentient calls or cries of the animals/machines, to the breathtaking scores and music... it is one of the best parts of the game, I immediately downloaded the soundtrack for my phone when I want to relax and chill before bed.

• Mod support:
Sadly, there is not much in the way of mods, of course, there are the obligatory naked and glamour mods to make women prettier for you thirsty mofos, haha. However, other than that it's just ReShade mods, which I would highly recommend as nighttime is way too bright and so are deep caves and ruins.

• Bugs:
The latest update sadly introduced some pop-in issues but the devs have acknowledged it and are working to hotfix it. There are few LOD (distant terrain) textures that have Z-fighting (flickering) but it's not bad just the occasional one here and there. You can sometimes get a big hit from a machine that forces you inside a texture such as a rock, meaning you will either need to load a save or call for your rideable mount, which will come close enough for you to hop on pulling you out of the glitch. Again only happened to me twice in nearly 250 hours played so it's not common.
Only ever experienced a few crashes and that was while I was alt-tabbing in and out frequently.

• Replayability:
Definitely replayable, there are enough weapons, outfits, modifications, upgrades, perks, and choices to make throughout the game that definitely make it replayable.

• Performance & fps:
Very good, actually I was quite surprised it was so good. With an RTX 3080Ti my framerate never dropped below 60fps at 3840x2160 on maxed ultra settings, and even with a heavy ReShade filter enabled.
Even when in big battles with lots of particles, rain or snow, fog, and dozens of NPC's/machines I didn't notice any stuttering or hitching.

• Game length:
Well, I just completed one single playthrough at nearly 250 hours, so yeah there's quite a lot to do. I was playing on ultra-hard and I do treat dying as a big deal, so I do play very slow and stealthy, if I get into serious trouble or realize I'm simply outgunned, I will run off and come back another time. Plus, as the world is so immersive and beautiful I do not fast travel.

If you prefer to run and gun, fast travel everywhere, and skip most of the peripheral and side quests, just blitzing through the main story I would say there is 30-hours of gameplay, but I highly recommend exploring and doing side quests as some of them are truly beautiful.

• DLC (Frozen Wilds):
I was actually going to skip it, I'm so glad I didn't because it's actually really really good. New machines, a really good story, side quests, collectibles, weapons, and armor. I really highly recommend it.

⚠️WARNING... I strongly suggest you play the Frozen Wilds DLC when you are around level 35-40 (you don't unlock it until level 30 anyway) and play through it before you beat the main game storyline. The story of the DLC overlaps with the main game storyline and mentions what's going on in the main game, so if you beat the main game first and then play the DLC the story might feel a little odd, some things might feel out the place.
Also... Be Prepared! The DLC is significantly more difficult as many players complained the main game is too easy, which it is in my opinion after the first few hours even on ultra-hard difficulty the main game is not challenging for experienced gamers, the DLC, however, is genuinely a challenge in places.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

And finally, I massively encourage you to take your time and enjoy it, explore the whole map, seriously, it's beautifully laid out and designed you can tell a lot of time, effort, and love went into it, plus you will find lots of hidden resources, secrets, information, plus great stories and challenges.

I really do feel this is in my top 10 games of all time. Maybe it won't be for you but that's OK everyone is different, however, for me, it is truly one of the most heartwarming, immersive, captivating, and rich games I've played in my 30+ years of being a gamer.
Thank you to Sony for porting it to PC but a massive, gargantuan thank you to the dev team that clearly put the hearts into it.

Definitely a great game! I spent about 65 hours working through the main campaign (and now starting on the expansion). For the sake of staying brief, here's my favorite things about this game:

- The story and side quests are progressed with interesting and well-acted, well-developed characters (feel more genuine and interesting than Skyrim NPCs). It's hard to NOT care about what you're doing because of this personal connection you get to feel to the characters and objectives. The big-picture result of the choices you made and optional quests accomplished really pays off in the end (no-spoilers explanation).

- Arsenal of weapons, ammo types, armor, modifications and traps leave a lot of room for sort of tackling battles in many different ways. Way to keep combat fun!

- The world is the right size, with many different environment types ("biomes"), littered with interesting settlements, ruins and landmarks, easy to find enemy spawn types, plenty of hidden goodies to find and amazing vistas throughout.

UPDATE: About another 30 hours and I enjoyed the bulk of "The Frozen Wilds", short of a few completionist-achievements. I expected another 10-15 hours of "more of the same", but actually I found the expansion to have some of my favorite characters, most memorable moments, well designed "dungeons" (a la Zelda) and pure joy over the power of the new element-heavy weapons (once upgraded). This is all a bit of surprise given that so much time was spent in a relatively small region of snowy lands. Great accomplishment! Can I buy more expansions yet?

Incredible game I can finally recommend! Takes quite a bit of tinkering but an incredible play once/if you can manage to get it stable!

***09/13/2020 - Finally managed to get the game stable enough to enjoy on my RTX 2080 and AMD 3800x. Changed screen from a 4K 60 hz to a 1440p with Gsync. Game runs much better with Vsync disabled and FPS limit to unlimited.

Also set in Geforce Control Panel:
Max Frame Rate (slightly above your panel limit) - set mine to 150
Monitor Tech - G-sync Enabled
Power Management Mode - Prefer max performance
Preferred Refresh Rate - Highest Available
Threaded Optimization - SET ON (Game will crash on my cpu anyhow with it disabled or auto)
Vsync - Set to OFF

Performance TIPS:
START on the absolute lowest settings for your gpu and set your resolution to what your screen puts out. Up the settings one at a time until you find what causes the biggest frame drops on your hardware!
________________________________________________

**Below is the launch review

Runs like garbage on a RTX 2080 and 3800x. Obviously needs optimisation before they released it but they must've rushed the release date. Tons of frequent crashes leaves a bit to be desired. Hopefully they add DLSS 2.0 or release a patch soon cause playing on my system I should be getting better than 30-50 fps. Stuttery as hell too. Now negative aside it is an incredible game. Just can't recommend it until they fix the bugs with it. Even finding graphic glitches throughout the game as I play.(fixed by leaving Anisotropic filtering to - Application controlled).



***Update - So played with the settings and I just can't get it to run on anything smooth on 4k. However... turning down the resolution to 1440p with the settings below fixed it... kinda. Smooth enough now to play and enjoy although still quite stuttery sometimes. Game is still crashing frequently leaving it unplayable.

Full Screen Mode
Refresh Rate - 60 hz
Vsync - ON (I know people say to disable it but I HATE screen tearing)
FPS Limit - SET TO UNLIMITED

Graphics Settings:
Textures - Ultra
Models - Ultra
AA Filtering - Medium
Shadows - High
Reflections - Medium
Clouds - High
AA- SMAA
Motion blur - Off (does anyone even like it?)
Ambient Occlusion - Medium

Changing those settings for my RTX 2080 and Ryzen 3800x seems to be a nice medium. Give it a try and see if that works for you. 4K seems pretty buggy even with adaptive performance or render scale adjusted. Uses roughly about 55-70% of my GPU with those settings at 1440p. Crashes did NOT happen until about 2 hours in.

***08/08/2020 - Game is running decently on the settings listed above still but constantly crashing every 30-60 minutes... Simply unplayable trying to enjoy constantly worrying about when it'll crash again. "Unfortunately the game has crashed."

Horizon Zero Dawn is a must play game

I had already platinumed this game on PS4 when it originally released and it was one of my favourite games of the last generation of consoles. So with Forbidden West just about to release on PS5 I thought it was well worth another playthrough. Well the game is still amazing and even better on PC. Superb varied combat, an enthralling story, great characters (especially Aloy), great soundtrack and best of all the incredible world - there are a few minor flaws but over all Horizon Zero Dawn is a must play

PROS

- The story really is great, video game stories rarely have me hooked form start to finish. HZD has me fully invested.
- When I first heard of the game I thought the premise of robots in a post-apopolypic world sounded ridiculous, but I was so wrong, the world is incredible. Huge sense of scale.
- HZD is absolutely stunning to look at and it runs very well on my system
- Varied enemies, weapons and combat. There are so many robots, all with strengths and weaknesses and lots of different ways to tackle them
- The characters - Aloy and Sylens in particular are top tier
- The game respects your time - there are optional things to do but the game does not go overboard. Everything has a purpose, when you compare this to Ubisoft games, HZD is how to do open world games - varied and no bloat, Ubisoft is how not to.
- The game is a good length, around 40-50 hours to do everything is a perfect length for an open world game. This obsession with 100+ games needs to stop.
- Music and sound design is great

CONS

- Some side quests are a bit lame and the writing in them suffers when compared to the main quest
- Facial animations aren't bad, but can be off sometimes, especially the eyes
- I wish the facility locations you went in were a little more varied

OVERALL – RECOMMENDED – A must play for single player fans, this game excels in every area

10/10 – A true masterpiece one of the best games I’ve ever played
9/10 – An essential purchase
8/10 – Great
7/10 – Very Good
6/10 – Good
5/10 – Average
4/10 – Bad
3/10 – Very Bad
2/10 – Awful
1/10 – One of the worst games I’ve ever played

The story alone is worth the price of admission to me. Lots of mysteries get slowly uncovered as you progress. One scene in particular is a top 10 gaming story moment for me - I was holding my face in shock, I couldn't believe it.

Achievement hunters will also be pleased to hear that nothing in this game is missable. Every collectible, every achievement, every task -- you can backtrack later and do/get anything that you missed.

The combat is intuitive, though I wish there existed a faster spear attack. Sometimes it felt a little slow and clunky.

Graphics are gorgeous. Lots to explore, plenty to see. I was taking screenshot after screenshot because I kept encountering so many great views.

Really loved this game -- had a blast.

True gamers always play as women, cause the hitbox is smaller.

This game is easily in my top 5 games of all time. Truth is playing this game has restored my faith in open world games again. Not gonna lie, I’ve taken days off work and called out just to stay and play this. Hope my boss doesn’t read this, but if you are… I regret nothing. And I’m the one who poops the toilet lid.

Allow me to sum up Horizon for you and save you from reading these other s**tty reviews. Ahem:

Humanity had some nice s**t, then fu*ked that s**t up. Then some guy named Ted Faro built some s**t that ate the nice s**t we had, all in the name of f**king other peoples s**t up. Our nice s**t was going to hell. We built some s**t that would help future generations survive the inevitable s**tstorm. That s**t also got f**ked up, mostly because of Ted Faro.

So, humanity is circling the s**tter, everything's f**ked, and now there's robots. These robots get f**ked up because the AI is f**ked up, but there's another AI that wants to unf**k the whole situation.

Then some chick named Aloy comes along, learns how to unf**k a bit of the s**t, but s**t is still f**ked up. Eventually some s**ts who want to completely f**k the situation come along, guided by a s**tty AI who wants to well and truly f**k us up. Aloy s**ts on that plan, and partially unf**ks the area.

In closing, f**k Ted Faro.

This game is a masterpiece that leaves a mark on you and the feeling of wanting more. And if you must take anything with you after finishing this fantastic game, let it be to always remember when life gets rough and your feeling lost or lonely, you just gotta become a strong independent brave woman.

10/10

Horizon is the breath of fresh air from the usual AAA games which are released nowadays.

>>The Good
- Amazing narrative and story, the story is so so well thought out and executed, it on the same league as Uncharted.
- I had shelved this game for a while, so when I burned through my library, I found this again and I thought might as well give it a try, I am not so much of a guy who likes to grind on single player games, but I really liked the side quests of the game, they weren’t that rewarding but they were cool.
- Bomb Gameplay, the gameplay is really good, from scanning the Robots to targeting each part in focus mode was awesome
- Strong Protagonist with a sense of purpose

>> The Bad
- We are now living in the era of games like Rdr2, so playing any game after that masterpiece will feel like a 'Game' not an experience, The NPCs in this game were very 'Gamey’ (if that makes sense).
- The Parkour was unpredictable, Aloy would randomly jump and grab the small ridge at the bottom or if you're lucky she might jump to the highest, every jump was uncertain.
- Variety of Weapons, this game does offer a lot of weapons and types of ammo, but you can very well complete the whole game with a bow and arrow on Normal Difficulty.

>> The Ugly
- Naa Fam there aint no ugly in this game.


Overall, 8.5/10
The main selling point being the combat mechanics and the Bombass story.

Overall a good game with solid story and decent RPG elements, only downside would be the lack of "overpowering" of enemies with just leveling up but it's just a small thing.
Story feels compelling and alive, only wish I as the player would get more choices when it comes to dialogue options.

Biggest downside = I had to go and buy PS5 to play the sequel...

If you tried this game before the 1.11 patch and were disappointed due to performance issues, I cannot recommend enough that you give it another go, now. On a system that struggled to hold 60 FPS for more than a second while looking at a wall on the lowest graphical settings, during action-packed gameplay I am now seeing MINIMUM 70 FPS at 1440p on the original PS4 graphics settings + a few tweaks to field of view, lighting, and texture details for even prettier visuals.
I have never seen a game absolutely leap in performance like this on a single patch. Wild.

Besides that, if you never played this on the PS4, you're missing out on one of the most well-designed, entertaining, and narratively beautiful open-world games to-date. Check this ♥♥♥♥ out.

This game has literally the worst pc-port I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing.
After 30 hours of play and about 30-40 crashes I decided to update all my drivers and everything I could possibly do to hopefully smoothen out the experience. Only to try and reboot the game and be stuck in the optimisation progress AGAIN. And now it crashes in this progress... making me unable to continue the game.
I have never had a game perform this awfully and I feel cheated. I do have to say that the game itself is amazing and will a positive review once this crashing-business is fixed.

edit: I have managed to get past the optimisation-screen again. But am still experiencing regular crashes.

edit 2: Since the latest patch performance has slightly improved. Unfortunately crashes are still frequent.

edit 3: after newest patch the game restarts in it's OPTIMISATION PROGRESS again!!! Are you for real? This should not be in the game in the first place. LET ALONE A THIRD ♥♥♥ TIME!!!! I have been a pc-owner for 24 years and I know what my pc can take... I don't want a dumb-ass program to determine this for me. I am perfectly able to tweak my own graphical settings thank you developers.

edit 4: The game is still crashing as of update 1.03. Crashed after about an hour.

Do you know the good old Outcast from 1999? Even though it was hyped for its voxel graphics, it was a great action adventure (with gorgeous music score!). The new Tomb Raider games introduced great graphics with lost of cut scenes but good 3rd persopn action. Hellblade is a kind of its own and a marvelous psychic game. But Horizon Zero Dawn is now the best action adventure I played so far: gorgeous graphics, great protagonist, tons of side quests and great ideas.

Works perfectly with current Proton versions.

It sure is a great port for the PCMR. After all the patches, everything has been running smoothly. And that doesn't end there, proud of the devs for the continuing support for the game!

And is it one of the best role-playing games with a good narrative and character development? It sure is and always has been.

*EDIT* After doing a few more updates and reset my PC (not fresh install) i've found my FPS to be considerably higher and more stable, i'd say that I don't dip below 60 fps at all now on everything set to high preset (might try out the ultra one but don't really see the point at the moment). So if you're seeing poor performance, just make sure stuff is updated and give your pc a restart, i'll leave my original review below.

Despite all of the current negative reviews citing poor performance or constant crashes etc. I can honestly say i've had a vastly different experience, the game has ran pretty smooth for me personally mainly around 50-70 fps only really dipping occasionally into the 40-50 range when it's gotten quite hectic. In the 10 hours i've spent (mostly taking pictures) i've only experienced one crash. Other than that the game has been flawless.

I'm running the game on a mixture of Ultra/High/Medium (similar to Digital Foundary's settings) on a 3440x1440p monitor - 3700X - RTX 2080 - 32GB Ram @ 3000Mhz - Samsung 860 EVO SSD

I'm not going to say my experience will be the same for others since we've all pretty much got different setups and such but they have said they're currently working on those issues people have been reporting. Hope to see an overwhelmingly positive score for the game soon cause it's so much better than when i played on my PS4!

Would definitely recommend this game, but if the reports of crashes and such are putting you off then by all means, put it on the back burner for now, lord knows there's a ton of good games about at the moment, but definitely don't forget this game cause you'll regret it!

Oh and if the dev's do see this, please give us DLSS 2.0 - the fps increase and clarity would be phenomenal!

(No Spoilers + TLDR at the end)

If you are the type of person who gets really into backstory and ‘lore’ then you will love this game. I was blown away by this element of the game and was not expecting things to unfold as they did. This game has some incredible mind-blowing reveals which shocked me and got me so much more engaged in the whole experience, there are dozens of diary entries and audio logs which really enhance the narrative and set the scene so well, I would highly recommend reading/listening to them all. I won’t go into details as I want to be spoiler free but specifically the reveals and details of Operation Enduring Victory and Operation Zero Dawn were incredible and were delivered masterfully, I was on the edge of my seat and HAD to know more and what happens next!

Graphically the game is incredible, one of the prettiest games I have ever played. The level of detail is wonderful even things that usually suffer like foliage look great, the weather effects and lighting are stunning enhancing every scene/ environment, the level of facial detail and animations are impeccable (especially with Aloy) I’m not sure I’ve ever seen better in any other game. Truly a beautiful experience, I cannot wait to see how good the sequel will look on PC! It already looks insane on the PS5.

Combat focuses on working smarter not harder with targets having many specific weak spots such as gaps in Armor plating to pierce machines ‘lungs’, going for the ‘eyes’, casting ropes to trip large enemies, destroying mounted weapons on beasts etc. The ‘elements’ play a huge role too such as for example fire and ice being more effective against certain enemy types which really adds to the strategy of combat. Stealth works well too and was enjoyable, the mechanics for stealth are fairly barebones (crouch and hide in foliage) but it is a viable and recommended strategy especially on higher difficulties, mounting the machines and using them to traverse ground quicker and fight for you is pretty cool too. I must admit the human vs human combat is fairly bland unfortunately, it is very generic 3rd person shooter/action but the beast combat more than makes up for this negative in my opinion and the vast majority of the game is beast combat.

The most common complaint is definitely the idea of this game falling under the “Ubisoft open world formula” which I completely disagree with. I have seen people say that Horizon: ZD is “just Sci-Fi Assassin’s Creed”. For starters AC Origins and Odyssey were both great games and largely addressed the stagnation problems with the Assassins Creed series, people just love to hate circlejerk anything Ubisoft touch, but also just because a game is open world it is automatically trash to a certain group of people. This game’s world is engaging and interesting with huge differences in the game’s established cultures in different districts displayed through the environment but also through the different tribes and groups (E.g., the Nora villages differing greatly to the Meridian capital being more ‘wild/savage’, differing to the mountain dwelling Banuk tribe ‘embracing technology’ more with their wire threading and views toward the beasts etc). Further the remnants of the “Old Ones” are really interesting and I loved coming across ruins of structures from the past and piecing together what they were e.g., ruins of a sports stadium. The world itself almost feels like a character at times, I don’t see how it can be seen as boring and formulaic at all. I will admit although I liked AC Odyssey it definitely had some padding and was way too big and directly suffered from that, H:ZD doesn’t suffer from this at all and there isn’t any (noticeable to me at least) ‘copy paste’ content to make it seem bigger, everything has a purpose and flows well together.

The Frozen Wilds DLC (free and included with the game) was also brilliant. Following on from the main story (I think canonically just before the final battle iirc) it includes : a deeper look at the Banuk tribe, a vastly different environment (snow and ice), some great new characters, cool new powerful weaponry providing more of an ‘end game’ and of course new machines! It also expands upon many of the core elements of the main story too and gives more context, backstory and explanation behind some of the core events (trying to stay spoiler free). Definitely worth playing, was very fun and I imagine it heavily plays into the sequel.

I am really looking forward to the sequel hitting PC. I will 100% buy it Day 1, I loved this game and can’t wait to see what happens next in the story as well as see the improved new mechanics and new beasts!

TLDR: The game is fun for everyone, very solid smart fun combat and great graphics. If you are the type of person who gets really into detail and lore then you will get so much more out of this game and probably love it.

After reading the pre-launch reviews of an absolute bug-infested Cyberpunk 2077, I bought this instead.

I definitely made the right choice.

Took 140 hours to 100% this game with dlc, for the price of 13 quid and a tenner on steam wallet, definite value at that price. The music and sound were immersive and the gameplay at the hardest difficulty was tough as bricks and good. Graphically beautiful and an almost seamless no loading open world outside of fast travel. The overarching plot was very good and how the main plot was revealed was well done. The only downside I found was that the side characters plot wise were weak and you simply do not care about them at all, and there dialogue was plugged in or forced. Overall it was solid in almost all aspects and worth getting. 8.5/10

While I thought that this game was great, I cannot recommend it due to a few reasons that are purely related to the port.

For starters, once you are done with the opening cutscene you are greeted with a data collection prompt with no way to flat out reject any data collection. This is in a single-player game. The lighter collection option only prevents one data type from being collected. Had this been in any other game, I wholeheartedly believe there would have been more outrage.

After going through the process of preventing the game from accessing the internet, you are greeted with an unoptimized mess that brought my graphics card to it's knees in Meridian/any involved combat. I am well over the recommended settings and should not have struggled this much with a PS4 port.

Overall, don't purchase unless you don't value your privacy and have a beefed out PC.

I'm in two minds about Horizon Zero Dawn: on the one hand, I love the setting, the world building is great, a lot of love has obviously been put into the game. Fighting robot dinos is fun and varied. On the other hand, while the setting is unique, the game is conventional open world fare in many ways. Even if the fiction this is set in is very different from the Far Cries and Assassin's Creeds, you're still doing pretty much the same over and over again. Missions have a lot of thought put into the stories they tell, but the actual gameplay quickly becomes repetitive. And the story itself would've benefited from being told in a much tighter way. Nonetheless, if you're still in the market for open world games and you don't mind repeating the same kind of gameplay loops for 50+ hours, there's a lot to like here. I replayed this on PC after first playing it on PS4, and knowing what I'd enjoy and what I'd like less about the game made it easier to focus on the former. I'm glad I replayed it, but I also have to say that I'm glad to take a break from what is in the end a gorgeous, lovingly made but still, at its core, fairly conventional open world game.

Horizon Zero Dawn™ Complete Edition ★★★★★ (4.9)

REVIEW by jSM 2021

One of the very best open world RPG's ever created! Polished to (almost) perfection, really fun open world, great exploration, lore, enemy design, stealth system, music, visuals, cinematics and story telling. Combined with relatable and fun characters, as well as a main plot that is exciting to follow and to learn more about.

I hadn't had this much fun playing and completing a game in a long time, and as an achievement hunter, HZD is incredibly satisfying to play through and to complete.

Recommended even at full price - There is no Open World RPG experience similar to Horizon Zero Dawn!


The Good...

Great enemy design and variety, as well as a challenging and rewarding combat sytem; fights never feel the same.

Vast and varied open world with a ton of activities, points of interests, and amazing sights to discover

Stunning visuals and world design - 'every frame a painting' ;

Excellent progression system; Reaching the max level of 60 just after finishing the main story after having completed all the open world activities and the included DLC area.

Fun loot and craft system.

Fantastic and clean feel; almost no bugs and only 2 game crashes in over 70h of playtime.

Runs surprisingly well; playing with 80+ FPS on 1440p Ultra Settings.

Includes the amazing Frozen Wilds DLC, that offers a whole new area and even more open world, exploration and all the above, with a main story that is on par with the base game.

Solid main story, as well as interesting side mission stories that all fade in really well into the overarching plot by the end.

Really good music and OST.

Has an incredibly satisfying 100% feel to it, due to challenging but fair achievements to unlock that reward exploring and experiencing everything this game has to offer!

The Bad...

Sometimes clunky movement and weirdly behaving AI, but that is not a common occurrence.

Hitboxes of incoming attacks can sometimes feel a bit too tight and punishing, even on normal mode.

Let me tell you something, this game hands down is one for the history books! Guerrilla Studios with only one noticeable game series under their belt have manged to deliver a game that [/u]almost hits the mark on all aspects of what a immersive and a thoroughly enjoyable game should be. Give a quick glance below if you are a casual gamer or even an adept gamer in the genre of Open World | Adventure | Action | RPG | Atmospheric elements to see what captivated my interests to a stage that actual made me play 200 hours of this game!
• Graphics - 10 / 10 - (Would easily put this as top 5 graphically pleasing games to the date October 1st 2021)
• Environment Physics - 7 / 10 (Please make the snow fall off the trees :3)
• Combat Style - 8.5 / 10 (Needed more Physical Combat mechanisms for the spear)
• Ambiance - 9 / 10
• Music & Environmental Sounds and Game Soundtracks - 9/10 (You will get addicted to the "Main Theme", Trust Me !)
• Character Development - 8.5 / 10
• Story Development - 9.5 / 10 (The History and Lore behind past events that occurred in game is my favorite part)
• NPC Immersion - 6.5 / 10 (Cites and Towns felt pretty average)
• Customization 6.5 / 10 (Not much in the department for outfits, physical and weapons customization)
• Enemy Interactions - 7.5 / 10 (Combat VS Machines felt ABSOLUTELY amazing, but Combat VS Humans felt undermining).
• Side Questing & Player Choices - 7 / 10 ( Wish all the side quests along with any emotional based choices made throughout the game had a much more clearer impact throughout the entire Arc of the game along with Story & Character development. So that it actually feels like the way you handle outcomes and scenarios make a genuine impact to the whole experience of the game.)
• DLC - 8.5 / 10 (Wont go into detail to avoid spoilers)
• Story boarding - 10 / 10 (Guerrilla did a fantastic job with connecting the dots and answering any burning questions the players had throughout the game . They also managed to keep all the current players Frantically excited for the next installment of the series, which is gonna be "Horizon Zero Dawn - Forbidden West" releasing early 2022)
- But all in all, this game was an absolute blast to play and really dive into. Really excited for forbidden west to come out next year so that I can spend more hours just walking across the map ! -
Would Recommend 10 / 10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Until Next Time Aloy ♡

Aloy's world is breathtaking, the graphics visuals and effects are well done
I love the different environments of the open world where each area has unique look
The combat is amazing, difficulty scales and the way you chose to approach every situation with the variety of weapons
it was complete for me.. many games has great story but weak combat side. Horizon didn't miss on this, it satisfied me a lot.

The main story was great! however the side quests weren't that much of story effect but they were okay, mostly they benefit much in exp and additional gear, so they are worth going through.

Thank you Guerilla for making it happen on PC 💙

Finally, the day came, and so did I - Horizon Zero Dawn is available on PC. So let's see if saving myself for this long-awaited moment was worth it.

Interesting lore can't save bad writing
I don't understand why the main plot gets so much praise. It's a tired "You are the chosen one, save the world" plot.

Aloy was such a colossal letdown. She didn't face any hardship during my time with her and did no wrong, ever. There is no character arc; It's more of a character upwards line. Sprinkle in a little does of moral superiority, and we have a completely (un)relatable protagonist. She is essentially a one-dimensional Mary Sue who is the be-all and end-all.

Since the main plot is so uninteresting, one would hope that, at least, Aloy's friends are memorable. I can recall everyone from the Normandy's crew, Geralt's friends and my Grey Warden's companions. Here...I only remember one - Rost. He is the only one with some depth to his character, with a past shrouded in secrets. The rest just point you to the nearest place in need of your assistance and sing your praise. As a result, none of the emotional moments delivers, and not a single side character is memorable (except papa Rost).

Then there's the DLC. Although it doesn't add anything to Aloy's character, the plot and supporting cast are far superior to that of the base game. The conflict between the chieftain and shaman drives the story forward, rather than some generic villain. It's fleshed out, believable, and you understand both perspectives, so it's not as black and white as the base game story.

Same-same, but different...But still same
As a masochist, I chose Ultra Hard for my first playthrough. This difficulty introduces two new features - simultaneous enemy attacks and higher prices for items. As a result, you must carefully plan your attack, avoid wasting ammo and unnecessary conflicts. So, push it to the limit! and play New Game on Ultra Hard instead of "saving it" for New Game+. I say this because NG+ on UH is lacklustre for a simple reason - no enemy scaling. You have OP gear, but the enemies retain their NG health and damage. It seems Guerrilla Games devs need to attend an NG+ 101 course.

Now let's talk combat (*Spoiler* It's awesome). It focuses on figuring out your opponent's vulnerabilities and attack patterns. Each machine is weak and resistant to different types of elemental damage, such as fire, freeze, corruption, or shock, so it's always a good idea to first scan them with Aloy's focus. Not only that, but they also have weak spots you can target for massive damage. Some are exposed, while others have a strong shell guarding them. Enter tear damage. It can tear the machine's armour clean off. But wait, there's more! Machines also have external components (guns, fire tanks, etc.) that allow them to use specific attacks. By removing these components with tear arrows, you also eliminate attacks tied to those components from the enemy's repertoire.


Could probably rack up another 150h by just exploring this beautiful world and "playing" with its wildlife

Shoutout to my brazilian boah DRo for helping me, after my GPU went to greener pastures, by capturing the second gameplay part


From bows, traps to slingshots, and icicle canons, there are plenty of tools at your disposal, each excelling in a specific situation. Do you need a machine immobilized? Use the rope caster. Does the enemy have a fire canister exposed? Set them ablaze with a fire arrow. For any problem, there is always a solution. And now, the best part - gear has fixed stats. There is no difference in damage between a tier 1 bow and a tier 3 bow. But, it does have more arrow types and more mod slots. This is why the better gear is, well, better. Getting better gear felt like I became a slightly more capable hunter, as it provides more options for dealing with enemies. Maybe set them ablaze? Tear off their armour first and expose their weak spots? Or corrupt them and cause distress among their ranks. The DLC also adds tier 4 weapons, but instead of new arrow types, they have a slight damage boost.

The RPG stuff it's pretty much just "higher number wins" and dull resource management. The skill tree also could use some work. It only adds two new gameplay changes, with the rest being stat boosts. Still, they did make the gameplay fun and engaging even after 100 hours. Slow-motion was unquestionably the best. Harnessing the 4000-year-old teachings of Max Payne, you'll glide through the air, delivering critical hits while looking fabulous. Melee combat and stealth are present and pretty basic. Overall, the AI is good; humans behave like humans, so expect some dumb decisions from time to time, with the machines following a pre-established path.


Photo Mode + Bugs = hours of fun

Surprisingly, the game isn't bloated with copy-pasted side-content, so they never felt tedious. The cauldrons were the best of the lot. They mix platforming and combat with a very nifty reward at the end - a new tier of machines to hack. Other side activities include clearing enemy camps, climbing vantage points, as well as Hunters Lodge trails. I loved these trails, as they offer a nice challenge, requiring you to use a specific weapon to eliminate machines in a particular manner as quickly as possible.

However, there are a couple of issues. The parkour can be iffy at times, and jumping onto specific ledges requires a prayer beforehand. Riding "horses" was fine when taking in the scenery, but as soon as they start galloping, tank mode initiates. As a result, my Aloy became a marathoner, and quite a decent one.

"Sorry, my face is tired"
Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful open-world games I've ever played. You already know what to expect in terms of biomes - desert, snowy areas, some mountain underpasses and jungles. But still, all of the locations you visit exude love and great care that went into breathing life to them. The creative vision behind each tribes design was also excellent. They all felt unique and have an intriguing backstory for their design choice. I especially loved the Banuk shamans, who had blue, glowing, wires threaded through their skin. Looks weird and cool at the same time.


The world of Horizon Zero Dawns is simply stunning

The machines are highly detailed and have an animal-like appearance. I loved getting close-up and personal, so I could admire all their tiny nuts and bolts. Their sound design was also outstanding. Each step they make emits a distinct SFX, which plays a crucial role in letting you know when ♥♥♥♥♥ is about to go down. Add to that how information about machines is conveyed visually, and playing this with HUD completely off was pure heaven. Also, I just want to take this moment to thank my former GPU, the GTX 970, for providing me with a stable 30fps, with mostly high settings, on an ultrawide 1080p monitor.
You da real MVP.

But...there are problems. The base game has bad lip-synching and an all-in-your-face camera, strange face and brow twitching, lifeless eyes, and stiff characters during conversations. But, the facial animations...my god, the facial animations. They can occasionally exceed even the legendary ones from Mass Effect Andromeda. The DLC did fix these issues; the camera is moved further back, characters now move while talking, lip-synching is better and facial expressions are greatly improved.

Final Thoughts
So, was my 4-year abstinence worthwhile? Kinda. The main plot, characters, and Aloy were all disappointing. But I just couldn't put my controller down thanks to its engaging combat and serene experience while exploring the world. So if all of those nice things tickle your fancy, Horizon Zero Dawn should already be in your cart.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a great game, if you haven't played it you need to. I'm not joking, buy it! Even if you played it on the Playstation like I did, buy it again... you know you want to.

Okay, the game is undoubtedly great, it looks beautiful even in Medium aka Original PS4 graphic settings but the real issue lies here with the optimization, it's very poor. Starting with Clouds, the ultra just trashes your FPS. The texture filtering is weird, seems not working as mentioned by Digital Foundry. Most of the issues has been covered by them and I'm using their optimized settings for better performance with less to none visual forfeit. But the stuttering here and there just makes this a real bad experience. The in-game benchmark tool is garbage, so far what I've played the benchmark tool stats has no relevance with real performance. Needs some serious patches, there's tons of issues to fix. If you can wait, I'd recommend you to do so until patches deal with this issues to have an utmost experience.

Optimized settings:-
Texture: Ultra
Model: Ultra
Anisotropic Filtering: 16x from Nvidia control panel (All in-game settings broken atm)** [Update: Forcing x16 causing weird artifacts issue sometimes, turning that off fixed the problem]
Shadows: High (Medium looks nice too, ultra is not worth it for the FPS hit)
Reflection: Medium (High has a major performance hit)
Clouds: High (Ultra decimates FPS)
AA: TAA
Motion Blur: Off (Personal preference, not my cup of tea)
Ambient Occlusion: Medium (This seems broken too, Ultra looks more awful)

TLDR: Performance wise Not recommended at current state.

Will update the review once this issues are being fixed.

So, Horizon Zero Dawn was an experience. I initially bought it when it came out on PC because it had cool robot-dinosaurs, and I'm all for both robots and dinosaurs. Turns out, upon playing it, it's an absolutely fantastic game.
The major plusses for me, as an experienced RPG player:
- The story is incredible. The main story is perfectly written, the details of the world tie in extremely well with the storyline (what the robots are for, how each works, etc), and the stories told by the collectibles is just as great. I genuinely shed a tear at the end of the story shared by the Vantage Points collectibles.
- The gameplay is on point. Combat is very dynamic, and offers multiple ways to face the danger.
- Visually, the game is a journey. It's a mix of both stunning graphics, and lore taught through design. The machines design, the outfit design, the environment design. All of it makes sense, and is absolutely delightful to wander through.
- The size of the world is on point. Yes, it's open a free to explore. But they also made it so that it feels large enough while being rather small and dense.

I'll point out a downside that I met while playing, the difficulty doesn't scale well with New Game+. I finished a run in Normal difficulty (albeit finished it at 100%, platinumed and all) but the New Game+ run in Ultra Hard difficulty was... Not specifically challenging. I will however say that that second run took me about 5 to 6 hours, I believe, and I have played a total of about 82 hours to finish the game and DLC at 100%, gather all collectibles, and finish all Steam achievements. If you plan on finishing it, it's pretty great value for the money.

My advice: get this game. It's a gem.

For now I don't recommend it at all, it need some patching. The stutter is annoying for me and can't handle it. I will change my review after they patch it.

Horizon Zero Dawn is already an exceptional game in its own right, but on PC it is easily the better experience. Whether gamers weren't interested the first time around or they don't have a PS4 but do have a PC, this is still a must-play. Even those that enjoyed Horizon Zero Dawn will find that the PC version brings some new layers to the table thanks to the higher frame rate and improved visuals. The game still adheres to the open-world mold a little more than some might hope, but the environments, story, and gameplay help elevate it enough to be memorable.

At this point, I feel like I've been spending more time after saving the game rather than actually doing other stuffs just because I have no idea when the game's gonna crash. HZD crashes frequently, like all the time; I can barely play 1 hour straight without a crash & my rig falls under the recommended specs that's been specified.

This is a disgustingly stinky pc port - never thought I would come across something more off putting other than my friend's room that smells like something's been rotting there 24/7. It stutters like all hell is breaking loose, almost feels like an apocalypse is going on from a technical standpoint; from 60 fps to randomly 8, 15, 24, 40 etc etc - are we playing the "kids! guess the fps" game here or what?

And, this is such a shame because everything about this game is absolutely fascinating & well put together, starting from its settings, the world & its atmosphere, story, gameplay & music. Really, what a darn shame!

In no way I recommend this game right now.

Horizon Zero Dawn

This game is an ABSOLUTE masterpiece and a gem, a must play for any story driven RPG, open world fans. This Game is stunningly beautiful in every way, it has a heart warming story which will leave you on journey for answers as to why ?

Just buy the game, play the game and you will see for your self''s with out me telling you why? as I am yet to know myself! , NO SPOILER's game is so worth your time, A MUST PLAY in this life time.

Make sure you have a decent PC, as mine chugged a bit in the cinematic scenes at the start, I was not playing. Son had a look once I had control of the child and set things right, now game runs smooth as a charm.

Wonderful game in deed, dont let this game slip you by, its worth every penny and I have only just started the game myself, I just needed to share what I have seen so far and Im very impressed so far.

Hope to see more games like this 1 in 2021 and beyond. !♥

A perfect example of strong, competent and enjoyable gameplay. It doesn't reinvent the genre, but it's a lot of fun to play. The mecha-dino combat is the highlight and represents some of the most enjoyable open-world combat on the market. Burning through powerful foes and looting their corpses for rare treasures captures an excitement rarely felt in open-world games. The rest of the gameplay is somewhat dulled in comparison. A somewhat weak plot drags down the experience but isn't enough to detract from the enjoyment.

I've originally bought & played back in 2017 on a PS4-Pro. Loved it so much, ended up getting a platinum trophy for it. I praised it then for its great 3rd person physics & gameplay so much that even when showing it to my friends. Every single one ended up loving it too. Apart from having some of the most beautiful scenery's I've ever laid eyes on. This is Guerilla Games first try at a dynamic open world game, a fresh new take @ a post apocalyptic world with these amazing but deadly machines that roam the vast land in which your main weaponry is a bow & arrow. Countless hours of fun is in store for anyone that is willing to dive in. Highly recommend for anyone & everyone.

Seems I am lucky, as I did crash only 1 time in 44 hours so far :-) Best game I have ever played by far! Mix Half Life, Crisys & Tomb Raider, add unique machines to fight with and you have this game. No repetitive farming like in Odyssey. Everything can be done and dealt with by different approaches like stealth or simply rush in it's your choise and freedom to play. Nice and deep story behind which you can follow or leave alone. Very well Done. I hope they will fix the crashes that many others do encounter... Impressively beautifull nature experience is what I enjoyed the most! The designer who did the rappeling animation for this game should get an oskar, because it is so satisfying. (Specs: CPU:I7-9700k GPU:1080TI MB:Aorus Z390 My Tip: Go Boarderless -> I do have less crashes this way.)

Never in my life have I played a single player story that drew me in as much as Horizon: Zero Dawn. I've never been one for single player games because you can pour hours and hours into multiplayer games and get your money's worth, but this game did for me what no other game has done: Made me completely and utterly invested. I listened to EVERY cutscene, Listened to every piece of dialog and listened and read every collectible I could get my hands on. Every second of this game I was constantly wondering what is going to happen next. Constantly wanting to know more about the world I was in. Constantly wanting to know about the bigger picture. Going on this journey alongside Aloy and taking in everything for the first time right next to her is a fantastic experience. Even months after I had finished the game, I was still doing deep dives on the internet and watching YouTube videos for even more tidbits of lore on this universe that I had come to care so much for. This game stirred emotion and wonder in me that I hadn’t felt since my first experiences with Star Wars as a young child. It truly hurts me that the latest game “Forbidden West” is a PlayStation exclusive because I deeply want to know what happens in the sequel. Well when the next game gets released on PC in a few years I know I will be the first to be there to pick up the journey exactly where I left it.

I bought it despite of the on going issues. So far I have not encountered any unplayable stuttering, or significant FPS drops. The only issue I have been seeing is that cutscenes lose audio. I feel sorry for those who have a lot of performance issues. I am not trying to downplay those problems, but I've seen that it really depends on your components. There are people trying to play this with a GTX 1070 at 1440p, expecting to get 100 fps, but that's just unrealistic. Others make it sound like their game is unplayable, period. But they don't really offer any context. So I'd take that with a grain of salt.

Just for reference, I'm running a RTX 2070 Super, and a Ryzen 7 3700x. I play at 1440p, and the FPS does not go below 60fps, though it lingers between 65-75. Truth is: the game is not well optimized because a 2070 Super should handle 100+ FPS. However, it is very much playable at 60fps, especially if you have a 4k TV 60hz. I keep it at 1080p since I dont see any major differences between 1080p and higher resolutions. That's just me.

As far as the game itself, I had gotten its platinum on PS4, and there are far better reviews out there. This game should've been released on PC during its launch. This game was meant for higher frames, and not the horrific 30fps on PS4, and especially not the 60fps with extremely low textures and dynamic resolution on the Pro version. This game was meant for the master race.


*EDIT*
I have made a benchmark for the game (Patch 1.02) for those who are interested. Link below:

Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the few PS4 exclusive games that I've ever "envied" our console cousins for having, since I was attracted by both its looks and story.
However, I have to say that I have a bitter taste in my mouth, because the PC port isn't as polished as I expected it to be.

Right from the start, we stumble upon an optimization screen that can take over 10-15 minutes to complete, depending on your system (in my case it was relatively quick, but I've read tons of reports from other users who had to wait for quite a while for it to complete).
After sitting there waiting for the automatic optimization,
I went into the options menu to adjust settings to my liking, and while I got a decently performing game after that, I have to say that there are still small drops here and there (stuttering), that, while not making the game unplayable, as I'm always over the cherished 60FPS mark, they are noticeable.
The game's mouse and keyboard support seems to be good, though I personally prefer to play with a controller in this particular case.

To sum up, I believe that the game has a lot to offer thanks to its hunting/collection systems, and I hope that the developers will update the game to improve performance.

For the past 2 hours I have been trying to actually start the game. With the configuration: i7700k, rtx 2080ti, 32 gb, ssd, all the drivers up to date I had only crashes. When I changed the game resolution it crashed, when I start the benchmark it crashed, when the benchmarked finally started, at the end it crashed, when I changed the setting from high to medium it crashed, changed the window mode from borderless to fullscreen and it crashed. 2 hours of 0 minutes gameplay, only crashed. How would you feel DEVELOPERS? Do not buy the game, it is not ready for release.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a captivating post-apocalyptic story centered around the adventures of Aloy as she searches for answers concerning her origins & past events while preventing a rogue AI known as "Hades" from using a malicious ancient horde of robots to destroy all life on the planet. Aloy's fierce beauty, lethal skills & witty charm definitely makes her one of the greatest female video-game heroines of all time.

Pros:
+Excellent Story: The story does an excellent job portraying humanity's struggle for survival in a post-apocalyptic dystopian world overrun with machines. The emotional events of the past, their relation to Aloy's origin & her importance in saving the world are masterfully revealed as Aloy progresses in her journey.
+Excellent Graphics: The many unique landscapes, settlements, wildlife & machines which make up this post-apocalyptic world are all beautifully rendered & feels alive, creating some of the most gorgeous scenery in gaming.
+Great Combat: The combat makes great use of Aloy's range of skills & weapons. Combat feels fluid when taking on large menacing machines or human enemies. Aloy's range of projectile weapons, traps & armor can be used to take advantage of enemy weaknesses to lethal effect.
+Great Controls: The controls are precise & responsive when traversing the in-game environment or in combat further complementing gameplay.
+Great Soundtrack: The somber soundtrack definitely complements the post-apocalyptic look & feel of the game, adding to its depth & emotion while exploring the open world on your mount or fighting angry machines.

Cons:
-Some of the side missions follow the same routine pattern which may get repetitive after some time.
-Certain areas of the map are too densely populated with machines which may lead to many unnecessarily hostile interactions which can become annoying especially when just exploring.

Never touched this game on the PlayStation, therefore this review will be as genuine as it can get. This is also my first time playing a Guerrilla dev game.

Performance:
On its own, the game runs absolutely great. I have followed multiple complaints regarding the PC port, but I haven't experienced a SINGLE issue running the game with a 1080 TI at full ULTRA with all possible settings maxed out. FPS is at a stable 80-90, with an occasional (and I mean, ONCE since I started the playthrough) dip under 60, during a clusterf*ck of fire particles caused by a less than successful hunt of a Trampler herd (I play on Ultra Hard, and it's extremely punishing). If I were to be pedantic and pick at every visual and performance aspect - I would only wish the HD textures were worked a little better on PC. Photo mode blurs everything on close-up.

Gameplay: Overall, very fluid and fun. Combat extremely rewarding and punishing on higher difficulties.
Not a huge fan of the fact that all the weapons and armor I have encountered so far needed to be purchased. Would be cool to have some of these looted from machine carcasses and/or lootboxes.
Huge issue with human head hitboxes - arrows sometimes fly through the side of the mask or don't register the hit. I hope a fix will come soon. Don't know if it's the same on the Play Station.

Story:
Aloy is a cool protagonist as they come - very sure of herself - gives off a bit of a Wonderwoman/Brave had a weird baby. Cool as main characters come.
Support characters are bland and voice acting is half-assed.

TLDR:
Pros:
Looks and runs beautifully (Nvidia GeForce 1080ti 11gb)
Stable FPS
Fantastic and rewarding Combat

Cons:
Head hitboxes...
Support characters and voice acting are lame
Seems like a percentage of PC players have tons of problems and some don't.

I hope that most of the PC player base will be able to have a pretty much flawless performance experience after a patch or two!

Horizon Zero Dawn is the best game I've played all year; it's so rare for an open world game to have combat and a story that remains engaging throughout. The variety in enemies and weapons is excellent, but Aloy's gradual discovery of the historic events that lead to the present day is what really hooked me. It's hard to find anything negative to say about the game, although I suppose the 'Ultra Hard' difficulty is a bit underwhelming.

To keep this short & sweet, I was very pleased to see this make its way to PC and have had a blast playing through both the game and its expansion. What I want to specifically pin point are the fighting mechanics - they're simply outstanding. Horizon enables you to methodically take down a range of machines through various weaponry - planning, crafting and executing your plans to fruition. It is some of the most satisfying combat I've ever had. Ripping machines apart bit by bit (with shrapnel/armour/parts flying all over the place), exposing their weaknesses and trapping them.. very satisfying and very rewarding. Corrupted machines (base game) and Daemonic machines in particular (dlc) provide excellent opportunities for you to hone your skills later on in the game.

The rich environment and sound quality throughout have been nothing short of exceptional. Aloy is probably the best female protagonist I've been in-game, and she provided a wonderful post-apocalyptic journey for me to experience. I am not one to revisit games after completion but this has been so good, that I'm sure it will tempt me. In the mean time, I will be impatiently waiting for Horizon Forbidden West.

The story of the DLC was not my cup of tea but the landscape was georgeous.

Great game in many ways, Aloy has a rather intriguing story and the game does very well telling you it.

Combat is always different with all the different enemies, utilising all your different tools to kill all the enemies is always nice

Storyline is good also and keeps me interested and drawn in. A well done port from PS to PC also from Sony! Wish to see more and in particular god of war and spiderman

HZD is a solid game but is plagued with PC issues in my opinion-it's so strange that this game that sold like crazy was given such a shabby pc release yet days gone which sold meh received one of the best pc ports in recent years. I'm hoping moving forward Sony and their studios will not allow any more of their exclusives to arrive on pc in the poor shape that HZD was, and I really hope we get Forbidden West on PC at launch.

I think as long as you have a solid pc you will be able to love the game because it truly is one of the best looking games ever made, the attention to detail and all the little things really captivate me.

I know this game has received widespread praise and I will admit that the visuals are quite stunning. It looks amazing on my 1440p ultrawide at high settings. However, being a middle age man, I try to write all of my reviews from that perspective. And from my perspective, it just doesn't do enough to hold my attention. I'm about 8 hours into the game and I think I'm ready to move on to something else. I really want to like this game and I think I gave it a fair chance. I just haven't experienced anything that is particularly memorable or awe-inspiring, and that is really what I need from a gaming experience at my age.

There is no question that the gameplay and graphics are excellent, top notch in fact. But the story...not so much, at least not for me. The story just isn't crafted as well as I think it could have been. I like a story that keeps me thinking, guessing, and coming back for more. In the 8 hours I've played Horizon, it hasn't managed to do any of those things.

It is tough for me to say that I don't recommend this game, because I have no doubt that a lot of people will (and clearly do) love it. But speaking as a middle-age man nearing 40, I can't recommend it. I've played several games in the last few years alone that have managed to blow me away. So I know they are out there, this just isn't one of them.

I was so pissed that this game couldn't run on my old clunker PC that I ended up getting a new one.

Was it worth it? I'd like to think so.

The story is more than a little bonkers, the game itself is beautiful, and I loved the machines (except the stalkers, those I hated). Definitely prefer the keyboard/mouse style of playing over a controller, but I usually do in games where I need precise aim. I like to be able to wander around without being forcefully guided by quests. My first thing to do in most games, if it lets me, is run around and open up the map, even if I'm not really supposed to yet. Definitely ended up over-leveled and overpowered with that shielded armor by the end of things, but I can't say it ruined the game.

I found myself kind of dreading cauldrons, mostly because machine dinosaurs jumping out of the dark is exactly the kind of jumpy I am. Once I got the hang of things, this was a super enjoyable game, and I'm glad I got to experience it in a way that made sense for me.

Really hoping they port the sequel, I'd like more dino robots please.

I am 18 hours into this game, I do not know how far along I am into the story because I take my time. I love this game. The music is amazing, the graphics are beautiful. The controls are so easy and I am loving the story. Aloy talks to you a lot in the game (well, to herself) and some of it is very repetitive, but sometimes she will come out with something different. In all honesty, I hardly notice her mutterings after a bit. I love the large choice of weapons and tools you have, though I stick to a specific few that I find most useful. I read some reviews stating that travel is impossible, that the creatures are faster than you and a remark on how teleportation is not free. Once you gain a horse (which you can do immediately after you get into the new section of the world) travel becomes much easier to avoid just about everything that I have come across so far. On foot, I still have an easy time evading creatures. All you need to do is break line of sight. Run around a rock, slide into a bush and you are set, most of the time just running around the rock is suffice. Traveling to a bonfire isn't free but I have gained free items to use it. However, since I take my time playing and I enjoy the world, I don't mind running there on my mount. I do play on Normal because I like to enjoy myself without being too easy. Enjoyable game, enjoyable experience, one of the few games I am actually trying to play through from start to finish.

Game will auto launch into a long cutscene and then ask you to agree to extremely invasive data collection, this cannot be refused.
Why does a random video game need access to my web browser history...

First Impressions: Played a few hours, level 5 at the moment

Aloy is a total badass, I love her origin story of the outcast having to prove herself and seek answers. The game looks and sounds amazing. There have been no issues with bugs or glitches so far. Will update as I go, but so far I'm hooked and I can't wait to be done with work today so I can play more...

It's been almost exactly one year since I beat the game but I still keep thinking about how much I loved it. The beautiful vistas, the music, the superb voice acting, the in my opinion incredible backstory all makes this game one of my favourite games in recent years and I sincerely hope that we will see Horizon Forbidden West coming to PC as well. It's definitely not a game without flaws mind you and personally at first I honestly even struggled to get a grip with the game due to the "robot dinosaurs" but they're all so beautifully designed and so diverse that you just have to love them, especially my personal favourite the gorgeous Grazers. And it's not just a gimmick to make the stand stand out among all the other open world games but is well implemented in the story and just makes sense.

It's not a must-play title but what game even is? But it's a well designed and beautiful adventure that not only touches but also comes from the heart and is also one of the games I would love to erase from my memory to experience it again for the very first time.

Absolutely recommend this game. But please wait a bit and buy smooth running FIXED + READY TO PLAY game copy.
Horizon have some tech issues at the moment (game crush on constant basis). It become normal on Steam to sell people screenshots with files in folders - so called EA games and good but non-finished ones. I'm not arguing, just point on fact. So it's your call...to have it now and have crashes on many interesting quests and spoil game experience, or even wait for discount e.t.c. Your call. Because devs are care abt money only, not about reputation and players feedbacks.

Very interesting and emotional main story line quest surrounded by tons of local quests, trials e.t.c. Main character without charisma, but still pretty good young lady.
No idea what engine devs used for this game. Witcher or RDR have better "picture" but still, this game made with cool graphic for Windows. In game main soundtrack and background music in game are top notch.

One of the best open-world games to date.

Just enough content to last several hours without feeling dragged out.

Love the deep storyline and artistic direction of Horizon.

Far from my dream game but still pretty smooth and addicting.

Words cannot describe how much I enjoy this game; it is the absolute ultimate mix of action, storyline, and graphics. The animation and graphics are beyond top tier, and the weaponry design as well as monster design sets the bar to the skies for other games. Greatly recommended, incredibly addicting.

I've bought this upon release mainly to support Playstation Games on STEAM so we can see more from this coming to PC via Steam. I was getting told that this Game is a Gem so I've tried it myself and Spoiler alert: They were right holy

First things first - My Specs:

i9 9900k
RTX 2080Ti
32GB DDR4 RAM
Installed on an SSD

Runs smooth on 1440p with 70-100 FPS on my 144hz Monitor.

TL;DR at the bottom:

The story grips you right out of the gate. Storylines have always been convoluted in open world games because of how sidetracked the player can get with other tasks and side quests. I was level 43 when I had main story quests for level 17 lmao. While this does have side quests, they can be resolved relatively quickly (though at the expense of character depth in side quest givers, but that's not necessarily a bad thing).

There isn't much that can be said about the graphics that haven't been said already. This is probably the only game out so far that wanted me to get a PS4 Pro, but it isn't necessary anymore since its on STEAM. The environments are incredibly detailed and the lightning is outstanding - for example:


Amazing!

What really makes this game stand out above many others in its genre is the crafting system. I am tired of crafting systems that feel like a chore, to where it's impossible to craft something useful without going well out of your way to gather the components. It turns crafting into some side quest time sink. Horizon eliminates all of that. I've continued to be able to craft anything I need with just items I collect on my routes through the story. No hours spent farming materials just so I don't run short on supplies further along, THIS IS WHAT QUALITY OF LIFE IS ABOUT FOLKS! It's still a diverse crafting system with many options.

The UI is crystal clear (You can also edit the Screen UI size), the menu system is perfectly organized, and everything seems to have just the right depth. I'm convinced that Horizon was the product of meticulously analyzing its predecessors and pinpointing what works really well and what didn't work so well, and perfecting nearly everything.

Anyone saying this is just another Far Cry Primal has the analytical abilities of a toddler. This is more like Witcher 3's kid sister, and she is a total badass.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a perfect proof, that if you give developers creative freedom and time, it will get you a sweet reward. For fans of action adventures and wonderful worlds Horizon is the obvious choice.


What a beautiful Game! 
A Screenshot of Horizon Zero Dawn
By: Saibot


TL;DR:

PRO:

+ amazing graphics and stunning environment
+ great combat
+ good dialogs (mostly) and story
+ fighting the machines is more fun than i ever thought
+ a lot to do
+ crafting

NEUTRAL:

- too little rpg elements

CON:

- dialogs are not ALWAYS good and outstanding
- Hunting Missions (Some of them are insanely hard. I wouldn't call myself the "average Gamer" I'm definitely better than that. I've 100%'ed this Game in 42.9 hours which is 17 Hours below the average gamer on "Howlongtobeat(dot)com" and no I took my sweet ass time even with Photo Mode :D

Proof:


100%'ed the Main Story - DLC Inc.

Edit 06.08.2021:

I've completed the DLC to also 100%:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2567639476

The DLC was absolutely beautiful - they expanded on the already beautiful main game. I played 5 hours in a row without a break and it didn't crash ONCE in my 56 Hours of playtime.

*RECOMMENDED*

The graphics are great. Movement is great. The view took about ten minutes to adjust to, but was fine after that.
Camera rotation is smooth and almost like the system helps out a little bit; I rarely have any problem with losing focus of the camera location.
The menus are uncomplicated, which is super impressive considering how many menus this game has. The leveling system is also reasonable and uncomplicated.
I haven't finished yet, but the story line is pretty good. In game action is way intense. I'm pretty sure I have forgotten to blink for several minutes at a time during battles with some new robot.
There are places to farm for materials and exp as well.
There are plenty of side quests.
The only negative I really have on this game is this: Sometimes, when hiding in the grass so the robots can't see you, you start to aim and suddenly can't see squat because there is a blade of grass or a branch taking up the whole screen.
But that's it. That's the only bad.
Traps are super important. Like really, really, really important. So get good at using them.
This game is what people wished Monster Hunter World had been.

It took me roughly 20mins (15mins after 1.05 patch)at the optimization screen before loading into the game.
Cutscenes and menu are not tailor made to fit ultrawide as Death Stranding, blurred boarder (swappable with black bars in option after 1.05 patch) is present on both sides, but gameplay is perfect fit.
Due to the increased resource demand, I had the game settings to dynamic so my gameplay would maintain 60fps+, and I noticed some flickering or flashing artifacts at the background of the cutscenes, probably due to the dynamic settings.
The game so far crashed 3 times for me, once after the benchmark, another after I choose to quit game and another during gameplay, all the same error telling me "The Game has crashed, do you want to send report to help us fix the problem?" People said to be Anti-Virus program related issue. After several patches game gets more stable and optimized but still not perfect at 1.05.

One weird problem when I was test running @ 1080p.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2191552340
As you can see from this screenshot there is this artifact, like those when over-overclocking ones, on the right and bottom of the screen, however this was not experienced in native resolution.

What an absolutely amazing game. The story is very well written and engaging, the combat is amazing, with so much variety and depth. The Side quests are interesting and not just another fetch quest.
Loved playing through it.
Only wish, is that there were more modification in the main game as there was in Frozen Wilds.
Other than that, a fantastic experience.

Master piece, if you haven't played it you are missing out!
Some of the best world building ever; from the clothing to the belief system etc. A world where almost everything makes sense and everything has a reason for being there. When you dig into the world I am always left with what I can only describe as melancholy for the old world and hope for the new. This game balances those two emotions so well. Love it!

I have been trying to figure out how to write this review for a few years. I first played this game on my PS4, and fell completely in love with it. The story is one of the best for an RPG I've played in a good many years and the worst part of the game was having to see the end, but... with that said, it did leave open the possibility of a sequel, which later was made, so the sadness turned to unbridled joy, until I found out it was going to be a playstation exclusive, when my joy was shattered. I refused to upgrade to a PS5 due to pricing issues and the fact that I was sick of Sony making us pay for the same games we already bought over and over again for newer consoles. Anyway, enough of my sony-bashing, back to the review!

The story starts out with a mystery. The young woman you play is an outcast, with a mysterious origin, you learn through the later story. You play in a world where there are remnants of the modern world, left in ruins, abandoned, and scrapped, with various tribes and sects that seem primitive by modern standards. To top off this weirdness, you encounter, fight, "Tame" and scavenge robotic animals, some that resemble well known creatures, others that seem to be hybrids or plays on well known creatures and you learn what they are for and why they are there.

You can complete trials, collections, and other types of side-quests that give you more powerful weapons and equipment, and scattered throughout the world are fragments of the past that help you understand what happened to the world and why it is the way it is now. The characters are interesting, the story is mind-blowing, and graphically speaking, the game is very visually appealing. I have played this game through to completion a half a dozen times, enjoyed completing all the achievements on the PS4 and have been working on completing them again on the PC.

For an indie company based in the Netherlands, they made a dynamite game, it's just a shame they went Sony Exclusive with the sequel. It was devastating to find this out and made me even more jaded toward Sony, as I feel they robbed millions of the chance to further enjoy this world and the characters we've come to love and care about. Hopefully, if a few years this exclusivity will end and it will eventually have the sequel available for the PC, at which time, I will dust off Horizon Zero Dawn once again and enjoy it all over again, before falling in love with the sequel!

If you love RPG's, don't mind a lack of character creation and limited customization of weapons and armor, more of a Static RPG, but with an amazing story and fun combat, beautiful graphics, and rich, intriguing characters, I think you will love this game and encourage you strongly to give it a chance. If you are put off by the sequel being console exclusive, I feel your pain, but I will say this game by itself is worth getting and playing or replaying again.

It's been weeks, I've tried everything and no matter what I can't get past 15 minutes of game play without the game crashing.
They made one patch, nothing changed. Sadly I passed my 2 hour mark for a refund so I just have an expensive unplayable game in my library. Don't buy.

I'm not a New Game+ person, but I completed it for this game

Pros
+ Great story
+ Highly charismatic main character (She can probably sustain her own franchise)
+ Memorable side characters
+ Great voice acting
+ Unique enemies
+ Fun, engaging, and at times fairly challenging combat
+ Gorgeous open world
+ Photo mode

Cons
- Item wheel is a little clunky

TL;DR
This game has convinced me to get a PS4/PS5 for Horizon Forbidden West

There was recently yet another patch and I have just now returned to the game and...it runs MUCH more smoothly for me now, so I'm happy to announce that I'm now giving this a thumbs up. I hate that I had to give it a negative review previously, but it was very difficult for me to enjoy the experience with how horribly it performed on my system (and games are about enjoyment!)
The developers obviously care about getting it to a point where it performs well for all/most system configurations, with the amount of patches they've done since release, so it really does deserve this more positive review.
To them, I say: thank you. Now I can really sink in and enjoy this experience. Thank you for working hard to fix things. It's definitely appreciated!

To everyone else: yeah, it's a great game and now it's vastly improved, performance-wise, over its initial PC release.

Good game. Super pretty.
But I am surprised it got such great reviews. Took a bit of work to actually get into it. In many ways very boring and it has Robot Dinosaurs! How can you be bored with robot dinosaurs?
But still I enjoyed it and finished but certainly no interest in any sequels.

I have a powerful machine and played it years after release but it certainly made it work, the heat climbs and the fans whirr.
The archery combat is good fun.
The melee combat is terrible. Dinosaurs can attack you through buildings. Just assume if get close you'll die and work on shooting and trapping. Which is odd as the hit locations for the archery are excellent. Shoot off that plate then the robot heart inside etc.
Pacing is odd. Sometime you just have to accept you are in for 30mins of not really skip-able cut scenes. Usually pretty and the story is ok but still if you are in the mood to shoot chicken robots in the face and have to hear the story of... whatever. Well just accept that is where the game is at.

Lot of other similar style stealth, open world that do everything better, eg shadow of mordor.

So sure I'll say yes to recommend but
certainly would not get if not on a good discount.

Everything in this game is simply so pure, beautiful and well written with every detail, mind blowing story, beautiful landscapes, character development, enemies, intense moments, skills, hunting tools, simply everything was made with love, a shame this was actually a Play station 4 exclusive game, a shame this came out 3 years later to PC, but I understand why it was kept exclusive because it's a sell factor for the console, and I'm just simply impressed after finishing the game and the sole dlc it had.

Thank you for letting us PC gamers have a taste of this masterpiece I'm hoping some more exclusives from Play station 4, come to PC as well when 5 is out.

Totally recommended!

Dinosaur-machines in a primal hunter-gatherer society ... Ahahaa come on, seriously?
Surprisingly it works!

Immersive open world. The game style I would compare to AC Valhalla, or better, what a Tomb Raider open world game might feel like. Graphics are beautiful, and the engine runs smooth on PC. Looks good in 21:9 ultrawide, and the Key Remapping for Mouse and Keyboard user works fine.

Horizon Zero Dawn is set in a post-apocalyptic world in the near future where humanity has been able to master advanced technology such as robotics. However, some unknown disaster caused the end of civilization and humans went back to primitive tribes. Fortunately, they managed to maintain some use of advanced technologies thanks to the old civilizations, which were destroyed. While the robotic dinosaurs have become the dominant species, both have been able to live together peacefully, that is until a new phenomenon called The Derangement started to make the robotic creatures more aggressive.

You play as Aloy, an outcast from birth for reasons that she does not know. She was put into the care of another outcast named Rost by the Nora Matriarchs. As an outcast Aloy is shunned by the other members of the Nora tribe, a fact perpetuated due to it literally being outlawed by the group. As a child Aloy wants to find out who her mother was and why she was cast out, so she teams up with Rost to get her training montage on so she can enter a competition called The Proving. The winner of The Proving receives the right to ask the Nora Matriarchs anything they wish. While I don’t want to say much more than the basics, Horizon Zero Dawn has one of the best stories in years that I have seen. It’s supremely intriguing and made me want to find out what happened to the old civilizations and why Aloy was cast out. Running all those ruins of old world and collecting every bit of information about them i could find was so addictive. The only other RPG I have thought this highly of the story was The Witcher 3. Even the side quests in Horizon I have enjoyed, and while they don’t matter as much as in The Witcher 3, they are still a big part of the game.

Horizon Zero Dawn is an open world RPG, and its also the best open world RPG I have played when it comes to its gameplay which is fast, fluid and incredibly fun. Using an old-world tool called a Focus, Aloy can see past the gnashing metal jaws of machines and at their components – specifically their weak spots and vulnerabilities. Every enemy has one, you can strike with a fire arrow to cause an explosion, an exposed battery shoot with an electric arrow can stun the creature. Knowing these weaknesses is key to battle especially on higher difficulties. The game offers also large set of tools starting from different kind of bows, traps, bombs, guns to tear apart metal parts and line launchers which can be used to pin enemy to the ground preventing it from moving. Some of the weapons can deal multiple types of damage and can be additionaly upgraded to boost specific type. We can have for example bow designed for physical damage, fire damage etc. All this give us freedom to approach every battle with multiple ways.

The game is huge, with a sprawling map that covers miles of land across various environments, from forests to frozen steppes to deserts. Thanks to the inclusion of The Frozen Wilds DLC, Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition is larger than the original game, with a frosty region added to the map that becomes accessible partway through the game. It’s nicely dense, filled with settlements, ruins, machine grazing areas, and bandit camps you can explore on your own or jump between while performing quests. Presented in spectacular immersive graphic, atmospheric music and brathtaking views will give you unforgetable experience.

Horizon Zero Dawn is nothing short of a masterpiece. Absolute must to play for RPG fun.

I've been waiting to play Horizon: Zero Dawn on PC since I saw its PS4 trailer more than 3 years ago. I bought the game a few days before its PC release to pre-load it so I can play as soon as it went live...
Of course I was one of the many unlucky people who encountered crashes right from the get-go...
I did persevere... I even wrote a guide of my experience to help others...

Crash Mitigation for Horizon: Zero Dawn (Intel / NVIDIA setup)

Updated 9/02/2020: Has not crashed so far since Patch 1.03 !!! Updated 8/28/2020: Partially Successful!!! My experiences in mitigating the frequent crashes during gameplay.
Eventually, I found the settings that allowed me to play the game for at least a few hours before it crashed.
When Patch 1.03 was released, the stability of the game improved for me. I have not encountered a crash since...
I can now recommend other players to buy the game if you were holding off due to the crashing issues...
Cheers!!!

Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the best original IP's I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing when it first released in PS4 back in 2017!

The world was amazing to explore back then on the console, and when it finally got ported to the PC, I ended up taking a ton of screenshots as the world is made more gorgeous due to the hardware limitations being removed.

One thing I really liked about Horizon Zero Dawn its in its art style and its creative designs, the world is vast, colorful and teeming with energy, the Machines are just so nice to look at and the different tribes that inhabit the world are pretty cool too!

The story, though ultimately very much familiar and done, it has its own creative flair to it that gives it that extra flavor to help it stand out among the rest and not be as tired and done as the rest.

Gameplay is ridiculously fun as its always a good time stripping a Thunderjaw off its disc launchers and just unloading the payload back at its owner!

The game is also far from perfect due to the following reasons:

1) Character animations are stiff
2) Aloy does not emote as much as i'd like which does take out the emotional impact certain scenes had
3) Certain cutscenes did not include certain characters who I was surprised to not see.
(Final cutscene: where was my Hawk?)
4) It crashed on me, twice.

Overall the game did not disappoint and the Frozen Wilds was just so good! I just wish we had more machine variety there! I'd say its worth it for the price BEFORE Sony pulled their lil bait on switch with the games price on steam.

But since they want to be corporate scumbags, i'd say just get it at 75% off, its an old game, so it really shouldn't be sold at the price that it was worth 5 years ago.

Its a really good game! An easy 8/10 for me, but don't support Sony's horrible practices!

*Edited*

Exclusives
Bad Console Ports
Crashes

Anyone who's a gamer *HATES* those three words & what they mean for us all. The fact that HZD was *ONLY* available on consoles originally was *DEEPLY* disappointing. Sorry Sony, I will never buy a Playstation. Not going to happen. I'm a gamer on PC only. PC's are my weapon of choice and that's not going to change anytime soon. There's a substantial segment of the market just like me - so cut us out if you want, but accept what you lose by doing that.

Horizon: Zero Dawn *is* a great game. It really is. One of the classics I'm going to say. However, the game was NOT tested properly before release. Likely, a release deadline had to be hit - and that deadline arrived before the porting team were ready. Upon the PC release, the game crashed regularly for many people, and many also reported performance issues with stuttering and nasty slowdowns as the game loaded assets in intensive areas. Now however, most crashes seem fixed, although the odd one *does* still occur. Updating to Windows 10 Build 2004 and enabling the GPU optimisation setting did the trick for me. Until that gem surfaced - I crashed a *LOT*. I run a Gigabyte 1080TI.

The game itself has a decent storyline. This world where a modern time is years in the past - with decaying remnants of that time scattered all over the place is a compelling narrative. What happened? What are those animal machines? Just who IS Aloy?? It just cements the importance of good writing and plot lines into games. Not all agree if you read many forums - but that's ok. Game production is an art, and you don't always like every piece in the gallery. I found myself wanting to unlock Aloy's story and that of the world around her more and more as the game went on, which I admit is a relatively rare thing these days in PC gaming. High end visuals can only go so far if the story is dead boring.

Free exploration is always good. That feeling of true freedom is just great, and this game I feel hits that mark pretty well. The world is open and I can go where I want without feeling forced or funnelled into it. Invisible walls do exist, but are rare. Hidden pockets abound, which is great stuff.

The fighting mechanincs seem ok to me. Learn to dodge and *when* to dodge and you'll be ok. Keep on top of weapon upgrades and you just may live to see another day. Not too hard - not too easy. Fights are rewarding. That said - I often find normal mode a challenge in a lot of games. Gears 5 for example - I found run of the mill mode in that quite a challenge. I will also say that later in HZD, I've found the fights a little easier against the various common machines. In a way that's nice, but does start to feel old. Same old machines for same old reward.

Definitely worth a play.

" Aloy!!! ....Survive..." - Best Quote.

Horizon Zero Dawn (HZD) is a game I have been long waiting to play, even that the release date for PC was late 2017, I could only touch it now and the game is a MASTERPIECE!


I will review the game based on 3 main things and trying to be detailed aswell.

Graphics (10/10)
GOD TIER, Like holy sht! To put things into perspective, this was one of my first AAA games with Raytracing enabled to be played on my new PC (RTX 2060 Super) which led me to a full new immersive world I hadn't played and experienced before, and not only that but the whole world and breath taking landscapes the game gives are just to much good!

Each 3 minutes I would be on a top of a mountain trying to take a few screenshots of it, you can take a look on my screenshot gallery for the results!

The time changing, from day - evening - night is also amazing and the amount of effects you get from the sun and shadows, the night sky super stellar!

Another important thing: the performance. The frames handled very well, my monitor is a 144Hz with 1920*1080p resolution, and I played almost with basically max settings on every option and managed to get a constant 90-120fps which is perfect!

OST/Sounds (7/10)
The OST is really catching specially the main theme linked more below, but has only a few soundtracks nonetheless yet very inspiring and crazy good!

Also the whole environment and the sounds from the machines is incredibly well made!

Story/Plot (9/10)
Magnificent, the whole concept of the world beeing devasted by machines and the human survivors not knowing what happened hundread of years ago with the antique civilization ruins to be seen.

Really enjoyed it a lot, with the Aloy's experience through the world, but I felt it could've been better somehow, still a masterpiece to be continued!


Simply amazing! Take a look at this video for the graphics:

YouTube™ Video: Horizon Zero Dawn 4K | RTX 3090 |Ray tracing Ultra Graphic Settings gameplay 
Views: 182,292
Horizon Zero Dawn 4K | RTX 3090 |Ray tracing Ultra Graphic Settings gameplay...


As for my favorite soundtrack the honorable mention goes to "The Main Theme" or also Aloy's Theme, which is really epic and motivating!

Now I will be looking foward the sequel "Horizon Forbidden West", which looking at the map details and landscapes, it is 100x better!
Can't wait for it to HOPEFULLY get released aswell for PC and play it right away on the first day.

I bought this game for the PS4 and fell in love with it. The dialogue, the story, the gameplay, all of it was worth every penny. So, having lost my copy, and it showing up on Steam was like a dream come true. But fortunately for me, I held off on buying it due to the can of worms (bugs) that soon manifested itself.
So I waited, several months, since its initial launch and reviews were starting to look more positive. So when it went on sale I jumped at the chance to buy it again.

God was I stupid.

My pc rig is by no means lacking. Its not top of the line, but it more than meets the requirements.
And yet,
So many times do have to wait for the game to "reconfigure" itself to meet my system requirements.
So many times do I have to fiddle with third-party software to deal with micro-stutters, slow frame rate, and the crashing, oh God, the crashing. Most of which was SUPPOSED to be dealt with months ago by the developer. And to add insult to injury, even trying to restart the game proves to be a trial as it can take 10 minutes, MINIMUM, for the game to actually close.

Again, the game itself is great, 5 stars easily, but this game was and is not ready for PC. And shame on Guerrilla industries for making us believe it was.

After several crashes, restarts and tweaks I finally got the game to run on my 1080Ti, i7 7700 and 16GB of RAM, however the game still has issues. 4K is a no go on my rig which is sad because this is a game that ran at 4K (checkerboard 4K but still) on much much weaker hardware.

Even at 1440p I am still only getting around 50-60FPS and at best 70 FPS at a mix of medium/high settings (with minimal gains even when i turn down to on par or lower than console settings which defeats the purpose of a PC port). but there is a really alarming amount of stutter that occurs during gameplay, cutscenes. The stutter is especially bad when when the cutscenes begin and end. Some graphical features like anisotropic filtering don't even work at all, forcing you to apply it in your control panel to get it to work in the game.

My peers who have even stronger rigs are experiencing similar results or even worse than mine. Weird flickering and graphical glitches plagued the beginning area. Some cutscenes and character/environment animations are locked at 30FPS which looks weird when the rest of the game is at a higher framerate. The list goes on and on.

TLDR: This is a very beautiful game that has a ton of potential to really shine on PC at max settings and maybe mods in the future will make it look even better and provide more content to keep it alive for years to come. But we can't get to that point when the base port of this game was done with seemingly little to no care at all. I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. Will check back after some patches.

See old review below.

I'm changing this review to thumbs up because the game is finally playable - i dont know if they fixed it or it was my hardware upgrade (ryzen 7 5800x, 32Gb Ram, RTX3070), but the influx of positive reviews leads me to them having fixed the problems over the last year.

The game is now what it was supposed to be, one the most beautiful open world action games on the PS4 in upgraded graphics and 60FPS. With my aforementioned hardware i am able to run the game on 2560x1440 Ultra settings in constant 60 FPS, no drops no stutters.

If you are looking for a pure action game be warned though, the game requires some stategic thinking and stealth to fully master... think more of a wither 3 kind of action than for example a devil may cry.

If you always wanted to hunt giant machines monster hunter style this is the game for you!

--------------------------------------------------------------

Initiated Refund and here is why (for me):
- Bought game
- installed game (70GB)
- Started game
- game said something about driver version mismatch, so i wanted to remediate that - game ignores me and starts anyways
- game stays in "optimizing your experience depending on your hardware" for about 55 minutes
- start playing - experience stutters and laggs, input stops working about 5 meters into the first cave - steam crashed (yes STEAM)
- end game process via task manager - update graphics drivers
- restart pc
-start game
- game stays in "optimizing your experience depending on your hardware" for about 55 minutes AGAIN
- start playing - experience stutters and laggs, input stops working about 5 meters into the first cave - steam crashed (yes STEAM)
- end game process via task manager
- start game and tinker with a couple graphics settings - experience stutters and laggs, input stops working about 5 meters into the first cave - steam crashed (yes STEAM)

System is i7 6700k, 16GB RAM and GTX1070 - installed on SSD.

I've only played limited number of open world RPG games in the past, so I'm not really experienced in this genre.
Regardless, I really enjoy playing Horizon Zero Dawn. The visual is stunning, the story is intriguing. And the combat system is rather simple, but still can be very fun because of how well made the enemies are. Now about performance issue, I only experienced framerate drop when entering settlement area. Even then it's just for a brief of time and doesn't really affect the gameplay that much.
In conclusion, for the price I think this game is worth to buy.

I had a few fps stutters on the opening cutscene, but so far, Horizon Zero Dawn has worked like a treat for me, no crashes, no other issues. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, the locations and characters detailed and very realistic. I never played the original game, and I knew nothing of this world I was about to discover, but what I've played so far has me hooked, and I can't wait to see where the story goes next.

Complete disaster on launch turned into actually playable game that doesn't force optimisation on you.
Always knew I liked the game - and they've done well to (eventually) get the game into a playable state on most systems. Very good gamela

Have the game on ps4 but yet to play it, so am very keen to check it out on PC. Game looks very good, and runs ok for now. Had experienced some lag in the initial cutscenes, though haven't had crashing like other people. Is actually playable when getting into the game which is great. Hopefully will be patched soon to give a better experience. Also give us more exclusive games!

What a whirlwind. Was Horizon Zero Dawn perfect? No. Absolutely not. The protagonist is a little annoying, the dialogue can be super stilted, and the explanations as to why things happened in the story eventually doesn't live up to the super interesting visuals and premise.
But I loved it all the same. The gameplay was so much fun, and the story, though frequently disappointing, had its moments. If you love open world games, you owe it to yourself to at least try this game. I'd recommend just ignoring the story, but that's up to you.

Oh boy. Horizon: Zero Dawn is a fantastic game, and the Complete Edition is a great deal. Together with the included DLC the Complete Edition offers dozens and dozens of hours of really good open world Monster Hunter-esque robot hunting and gathering. One of my favourite games of the current generation, and as a GAME a very easy and very big recommendation. However -- and this is a pretty big however: the PC version isn't great.

On my system (Core i7-8700, RTX 2080 Super, 32 gigs of DDR4-3200MHz and a Samsung 970 EVO Plus) the game theoretically runs well. On 1440p at the game's auto-detected "prefer quality" settings it runs at a fairly solid 60-70 FPS. This is of course a lot less than in Death Stranding (a game that kind of runs on the same engine), which easily maintains a solid 150FPS at maximum details and a lot less than I was hoping for. But hey, 60-70 FPS is still pretty good, right? Well, yes and no.

While the framerate is technically decent, the game has constant and very irritating stuttering. Sometimes it's micro-stuttering, other times it's macro stuttering. The animations often look weird and the whole game has this very awkward stuttering feel to it. This doesn't outright RUIN the game, because you can still play it just fine. I was delighted to find out that the game of course works just fine on a controller, but also on a mouse and keyboard. I was really missing the precision of mouse aiming on the PS4 original, so this is a very welcome discovery.

So would I recommend Horizon: Zero Dawn? Yes and no. As a game, absolutely. It's still an excellent and very modern open world game with a good story, an engaging world and tons of very entertaining gameplay. But this PC conversion isn't good. It's borderline bad. I of course have every hope that the dev team keeps updating the game to patch out the performance issues, but come on, guys: how the hell did the game even launch in this state to begin with? The game is still playable, but the PC port is overall far rougher than you'd hope for, so whether or not that is something you want to support with your money is up to you.

For me, the game itself is still good enough to make dealing with the technical issues worthwhile.

Video recorded from the early game to illustrate the stuttering:

YouTube™ Video: Horizon Zero Dawn PC: Looks great, but weird stuttering 
Views: 4,242
Technically the game was running at around 60 FPS throughout, but as you can see there is this constant micro-stuttering.


More gameplay:

Views: 38
Am I getting used to it, or is the game stuttering less? It is a mystery! An even bigger mystery is that my CPU is at 70-80% and my GPU at 25-30% so why isn't the game running better?

Let me be clear: Horizon is a fantastic game. Its setting is unique, its gameplay is fun, the soundtrack is amazing, and its art direction is just fantastic.

But this PC version of the game is... not good. Many of the display / graphics settings are broken in one way or another, the game runs very poorly compared to other similar games no matter what your settings are, and the stuttering that happens every time the UI refreshes becomes incredibly annoying once you start scanning things in the environment.

I love Horizon, but I cannot recommend the PC version. It needs a lot of work.

This is the best version of a great game, it looks better and it performs better than the impressive PS4 release. However, we still think there is a room for improvement.

A game that pulls together the best of many others.
This game surprised me, it had been on my must pay list for years now. The game combines exhilarating action, a huge beautiful world, great story and RPG elements together to create a journey that you can surely walk through taking everything in and play stealthily, or an awesome action game.

On a modern computer, Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition looks absolutely stunning, thanks to new visual options - more frames per second, adjustable FOV... There are some technical flaws, but it doesn't prevent from enjoying Aloy's Adventure and its magnificent post-apocalyptic open world, even if it feels a bit redondant and not that refreshing in terms of stage work and dialogues.

P.S. I am using Digital Foundry recommended settings.

Absolutly fantastic game.
I've never seen a game like this.
A very beautiful world in which an equally great story takes place.
Maybe it's early to write a review, but last time I was similarly excited about AC Odyssey.
Aloy,i wish you good luck

I'll start off by saying that I played through it entire and ended up getting 100% completion in 60ish hours
I picked the game up on the last winter sale and managed to play through it entirely so I can't say I didn't get my money's worth out of it
With that being said, I'm not so sure that I'd really "recommend" this to anybody... That's not to say it's a bad game, I didn't think it was "bad" and I'll hopefully be able to explain that a bit

To start with the good, I think the world that this game has is phenomenal. I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic environments and I think the world itself is designed really well. I found myself using the photo mode a lot and I normally never touch it but some of the area's are just beautiful. I spent a lot of time running around just picking up everything I could because I'm a loot hoarder.
The Machine creatures are also pretty interesting to me, I thought it was a nice twist instead of having just normal dinosaurs or whatever.
The combat was probably the one and only thing that kept me playing throughout the entire time. I ended up playing through on ultra hard mode and considering you could get pretty much one shot, you had to really focus on hitting each machines weak points and using the right equipment to take them down. I thought it was pretty enjoyable, even if frustrating sometimes but that was probably just down to me enjoying the spear more than the bow. I remember reading that people thought the Thunderjaw was the hardest enemy in the game, I didn't think this was the case. Those damned glint hawks and Stormbird thing were an absolute nightmare for me.

Unfortunately, that's where the "good" really ends for me.

I picked the game up because I was looking for a pretty heavy story focused game to sink some time into... Considering it was nominated for story rich game in the 2020 Steam Awards, I figured it had a pretty good shot to be exactly what I was looking for. I didn't end up enjoying it like most, if not all of the positive reviews say.
I can't tell if I played through the game "wrong" or what, but I ended up doing what I do in most games with questing, and that is go to a new town/area, completing all the side quests for that area and then moving on to the next area with the main storyline. I ended up over-leveling the main storyline quest by like 30 levels, even though the levels don't really have any impact on the game (as far as I could tell anyway)

To start with the main story (spoiler free), I was pretty bored by the time I really "started getting into it". I wanted to learn more about the machines but I wasn't invested in *any* of the characters the game had to offer, aside from the first one you meet and then the character named "Sylense", and that was just because I recognized the VA from his other work/games.
I felt like most, if not all of the characters I met were pretty lifeless and uninteresting. Aloy, the character you play as had a good voice to her but her facial expressions/eyes didn't match what the energy of her voice was giving off.
The first 10 hours I was in the game I didn't have any issues with this, about 10/15hrs in I started to noticing long gaps in dialog during cutscenes (like a full second or two where both the people were just staring at each other instead of talking) and it just seemed really awkward and almost unfinished. I also saw some cutscenes where the characters in the scene were essentially teleporting between transitions like a jump cut... I wasn't really happy seeing this considering the animations and stuff were really good and then all of a sudden the characters were jumping around... Just seemed kind of lame but I'm sure most people just look past this kind of thing.
I was pretty surprised that a lot of people, if not most, praise the story of this game but maybe that just comes down to a me thing.

Moving onto the other questlines-

I spent the first 40 hours of my time in the game completing all of the side quests that I had come across and I was about ready to just give up and uninstall the game just due to how repetitive they are. The characters you meet have almost no significance to anything that happens in the game (aside from maybe a couple) and the side quests/errands are almost all the same layout.

> New NPC with quest > lost item/person > go to where it/they were last seen > follow tracks/examine blood/item > find person or item/fight machine for item > backtrack to original NPC

I know most games with a side questline aren't the most interesting but it just felt like such a chore to keep doing when it had no impact on the game at the end of the playthrough. I think in total for the main story there's only like 20 missions? The side stuff just seemed completely pointless to do unless you were going for a 100% completion... but I suppose that's kind of the point? I don't know. I just wasn't happy having to do the same almost brainless task of following tracks and pressing "e" on the item to "examine" it and then just be done and only getting a few shards as rewards. Eventually during the DLC area you do come across an NPC with some side quests that offers to upgrade your weapons and I feel like even that would have made them less annoying and more rewarding if they were in the base game.

Moving away from the story elements to try and wrap it up a bit

When you learn how to override the machines to use them against other machines, I was super hyped because this meant you were able to use them as mounts to move about the pretty large world. That was almost immediately shattered for me. I don't know if it's a keyboard/mouse issue, but the mounts felt SUPER clunky the entire time to where I pretty much opted to do the entire game on foot. They would randomly stray from going in a straight line and suddenly start jumping over objects and rocks that I wasn't even really near. Going up even some of the smallest hills that, you, as the character, could walk up just fine, the mounts just wouldn't walk up at all.

Hunter's Lodge challenges..... I might be the only one that thinks this, maybe not... These were the most annoying things in the entire game. The only real reason they're "challenging" is down to the utterly ridiculous short timer that they throw at you to increase the difficulty to get the golden box rewards. I had the most frustrations in the entire game just trying to get these out of the way. The rewards should have been a lot better, at least for the first time you get the blazing sun box. I wouldn't mind if you got the current rewards you get now if you just kept on repeating them, but I normally spent more than I got back trying to attempt the challenges that I failed over and over again. Some of them were a little too easy, some of them were a nightmare and made me want to pull my hair out.

This is starting to get pretty long and I feel a little bad since just from a glance, the bad stuff (imo) kind of overpowers the good but honestly, I don't really have much good to say other than the world/machines designs. If you've read this far, great. I hope I explained it good enough, if not oh well. I tried. If you're anything like me and enjoy post-apocalyptic worlds to explore, you might find something with this but otherwise I couldn't really say that I think it's worth getting. Nothing else really kept me other than the world and combat.

> TLDR

World Design, good, very beautiful
Characters/expressions seem lifeless and uninteresting
Story wasn't all that captivating for me
Side quests were extremely boring and most had no effect on the end game story
Mounts were extremely clunky
Hunter's Lodge Challenges were extremely annoying and felt unrewarding

I hope to see things I mentioned improved in a second game, assuming they decide to make one. Even though most of the is negative points, it was no means a "bad" game. I at least managed to get my money's worth out of it.

TIL steam has a review character limit....

Great Game. Bad Port.

I really want to recommend this game. I do. It is an absolute masterpiece and I loved playing it… on the PS4. On PC this game is nearly unplayable unless you have only the top of the line hardware or willing to play one of the most beautiful games of the last generation on settings that make it look like minecraft. It barely hits 60fps with major graphical downgrades for me and I have a 2070 Super FTW3 card. The stuttering, the huge 20-30fps drops in places, the nearly 15 minutes you have to wait for shaders to load EVERY TIME YOU START THE GAME. It’s a mess. Now, will I remove my review if the Devs fix these issues? Absolutely. That hand will flip to a thumbs up and I will get to write a review about the gameplay itself. But, as it stands, you might be better off picking this game up on the PS4/5. And that pains me to say as a proud member of PCMR.

--Edit as of 11/27/20--
The dev is proving to be committed to this game and is patching it at a fast pace. Some issues have been fixed but many more remain. FPS is still very jittery and can rip you right out of the experience. While there is improvement, it might be many more months till this is what I consider playable.

--Edit as of 12/04/20--
I have 100% this game now, and let me tell you it was much easier on the PS4. The game would crash at the worst times and the frame lag would make some battles more about where could I lure the enemy where I could get a smoother framerate rather than just trying to take down the enemy. A 40+ frame drop at the wrong time could mean having to reload a save.

I will say the 1.08 patch DID help with many of the issues, it just isn't enough though the devs are making great improvements. While I can not endorse this game as is, I highly suspect that will change in the future.

--Edit as of 12/12/20--
For the record, my rig doesn't even have integrated graphics (for the person that asked) and drivers are up to date. This isn't my first rodeo and I have been building/repairing/maintaining PC's for over 25 years now. I am not an idiot with a 'gaming craptop' that doesn't understand the capabilities of my machine and how games should run on it. For H:ZD I did everything I could to give this title a chance: Limited to 1080@60, OC'd my card, dropped shadows and reflections down to medium, medium textures... and STILL was getting jarring and unreasonable FPS dips.

--Edit as of 4/5/21--
I have not had a chance to get back to this game after the latest patch, however a quick benchmark shows significant improvements with few dips. Will try to find time this weekend to give it a good play test.

Everything from the environments to the character design to the music to the gameplay is amazing.

The environments are gorgeous and interesting throughout, and each regional tribe has their own aesthetic. The machines all have great designs and are fun to fight  and there are different options for taking them down to suit your playstyle via several different weapons and arrow types.

The story is really well done, with engaging characters throughout and some different dialogue options to keep repeat playthroughs interesting. Though it's worth noting it's not necessarily a "choices matter" type of rpg.


A lot of people seem to have had some graphical errors, stuttering or crashing. Personally I haven't had a lot, never had a crash but I have had some stutter in busy areas; but I've played Jedi Fallen Order. HZD is not stuttery. I also found that switching desktop screens while on the crafting menu can freeze it.
I play on the Original/medium settings with a laptop RTX2060 and a 9th gen i7.

Overall it's an overwhelming yes from me, definitely one of my favorite games now. For sure worth full price, and even more so on discount.

Get this game. Play it. Then play it again.

This is by far one of the most beautiful and engaging games I've ever played. It runs smoothly, the story is amaze-balls, and the combat/rpg elements are top-notch. This is one of the all-time greats, and here's to hoping more great games get ported to PC in such amazing fashion.

Outstanding game. Beautiful visuals, interesting storytelling, overwhelming gameplay and sound design. Everything plays and feels good in this game. I'm so glad I got to play this on PC without spoilers. Amazing experience to finish this game and continue exploring all the secrets, side quest, missions and so much! Got this as a gift. Totally worth it!

Information

Horizon Zero Dawn ™ Complete Edition is an Action / RPG developed by Guerrilla. First of all, it should be mentioned that most of the negative Reviews about the game have to do with hardware problems, but I cannot share their opinion, as I haven't had a single game crash or any other problem in my playing time so far.

System

CPU: Intel Core I7-8700K
GPU: GeForce GTX 1070ti
RAM: 16 GB DDR4

Gameplay

Back then I had traveled the gaming world with Aloy on PS4 for more than 60 hours and had reached player level 57. I played through both the main game and the expansion "The Frozen Wilds". However, this game really fascinated me. Unlike in many other reviews, I don't want to give a single rating for story, graphics, audio, control, but rather combine these elements. After all, who can help "5 * graphics" when an overall package of games is bad? I will not give any story spoilers and I will be reluctant to comment on the game world.
First of all, I would like to note that the game designers certainly used a best-of from games like "Tomb Raider", "Skyrim", "Mass Effect" and "Assassins Creed". This applies to perspectives and camera work, effects, controls, elements of the narrative, level and character design. I find this absolutely okay - a valuable, good game does not necessarily result from doing everything differently. However, Horizon only uses these elements ("use" was the word, not copy) and creates something new from it. The game is essentially divided into story elements and combat situations. Both, together with the "new discovery drive", are the main drivers that always lead you back to the console and into the gaming world. The story is presented in an elaborate way: there are many cut scenes, but they are seamlessly integrated. The setting of Aloy and all NPCs in the game is absolutely flawless, especially in German/English (apart from the lack of lip sync, which didn't bother me). In many dialogues, mere pixels become lively characters, whose names and history are not to be forgotten. You can enjoy the dialogues like a movie, but the options in the dialog are limited (i.e. you do not form a relationship with any of the NPCs that results from the dialog behavior).The combat situations, which are partly initiated by side quests, have always spurred me on. The machines, especially in new areas that you have only recently entered, remain really dangerous for a long time until you have the "bow". Based on this: the bow is far from the only weapon in Horizon: Zero Dawn. There are three bows with different types of arrows and different "levels". There are slingshots, traps, etc. so that you can develop a personal style, in my opinion the bows play the main role. The machines each have their own weak points, which you only learn in several battles against them, furthermore you have to think very carefully about when you initiate battles. Because as soon as there are too many machines in the vicinity, that's it - maybe you just manage to escape. But that is exactly what always creates a certain tension and challenge that is fun.
The control, which is of course really important in the fights, I think is good. However, this may be a point of criticism: due to the extremely high choice of ammunition and types of weapons, you can sometimes get into the selection.
For me, the background music for the game is not only suitable for the fights. Linked to areas and quests, this changes according to the respective event. If there is a fight, the music becomes more dynamic and it is not always the same. Together with the other sounds of the game, such as the trampling of the machines, the sounds of the animals, the rustling of the leaves in the wind, the comments that Aloy occasionally makes on their own, and the great dialogues already mentioned, the entire tonal range is absolutely identical on one high level like the graphically presented world.
The main story is conclusive, although of course not really realistic. As the main character, Aloy makes a thoroughly credible idea. The expansion "The Frozen Wilds" is really worth it and adds another important aspect to the overall world with the Banuk, which live on average.

Certainly not all of the side quests that result from this are totally different, but every effort has been made to ensure variety. Variety is a key word that deserves special mention, especially in terms of world design and graphic splendor. From the day / night changes that really have a big impact, especially on fights because you simply can't see your opponents, to weather changes, sunsets, auroras, etc. and simply a breathtaking variety of vegetation or none. There are forests, jungles, steppes, desert, ice tundra, mountains, valleys, glacier landscapes ... I have definitely forgotten something. All of this is presented very elaborately and therefore deserves enormous praise to the development team. Not just for "the graphics" but for the design of the areas with the available elements.

Pro

+ atmospheric entry takes time
+ interesting world mixes stone age & high-tech
+ fantastic looking game world
+ a lot of details
+ atmospheric lighting moods and weather effects
+ excellently animated machines
+ great German/English setting
+ beautifully designed tutorial
+ four levels of difficulty
+ fair reset points within the missions
+ lots of campfires for quick travel
+ Game scales fairly
+ long main quest with about 30 hours of playing time
+ numerous side missions and additional orders
+ Bandit camps and machine hatcheries
+ lots of weapons and outfits
+ a lot of collecting stuff
+ Steam Achievements

Kontra

- feels a bit generic in places
- History starts relatively late
- skill tree not mature
- Treasure maps very cheap

Conclusion

The PC version of the visually stunning open world adventure Horizon Zero Dawn has been implemented convincingly and scores with a varied / captivating open world with a unique SciFi story, battles against unprecedented robots and a merciless heroine who is somewhat reminiscent of Lara Croft, but tells its own story.


Kurzreview in Deutsch

Horizon Zero Dawn ™ ist ein Action-Rollenspiel, welches von Guerrilla entwickelt wurde.

Gameplay

Die Geschichte spielt in einer postapokalyptischen Zukunft, etwa 1000 Jahre nach dem Zusammenbruch der menschlichen Zivilisation. Die Überlebenden einer zunächst nicht näher beschriebenen Katastrophe haben sich zu Stämmen auf unterschiedlichen, präindustriellen Entwicklungsstufen zusammengeschlossen und leben ähnlich den Völkern der Steinzeit und der Antike, umgeben von den Ruinen der so genannten „Alten“. Der eklatante Unterschied: Die Spielwelt wird von futuristischen Maschinenwesen bevölkert, die (teils urzeitlichen) Wildtieren und Dinosauriern in einer Cyberpunk-Optik nachempfunden sind.
Menschen und Maschinen lebten lange Zeit in Koexistenz, wobei die Maschinen von den Menschen wegen ihrer Bauteile und Ressourcen gejagt wurden. Etwa 20 Jahre vor dem Spielgeschehen tritt eine Veränderung auf, von den Menschen „Maschinenstörung“ genannt. Diese befällt die Roboter, die dadurch immer mehr zu einer tödlichen Bedrohung für die Stämme werden. Zudem tauchten immer mehr neue, gezielt für den Kampf entworfene Maschinentypen auf und bedrohen die verbliebene Menschheit.

Fazit

Die PC-Version des bildgewaltigen Open-World-Abenteuers Horizon Zero Dawn ist überzeugend umgesetzt worden und punktet mit einer abwechslungsreichen/fesselnden Open World mit einzigartigen Geschichte in der Zukunft, Kämpfe gegen nie dagewesene Roboter und eine erbarmungslose Heldin, die etwas an Lara Croft erinnert, aber ihre eigene Geschichte erzählt.

Short review: Overall 7.5 / 10. Good Open World game. But don't expect RDR2 (2018), AC, Far Cry or Tomb Raider levels of quality. Bow combat, sneaking around (if you want to), and taking down large mechanical animals, this game is definitely worth a sale price. But some sloppiness in certain areas cause it to fall short in overall quality compared to other games of similar age.

Long Review:
Positives: Good story (inc. dlc), and lore. Enjoyable bow / sling combat with different types of ammo. Traps are cool but didn't use them outside of "hunter challenges" that much. Corruption ammo was useless. The Open world is massive with varied biomes. Side stories and quests can be interesting. And the terrain looks great. Nice touch being able to harvest when on a mount. Some aspects feel familiar to Far Cry games (do a particular thing to unlock an area map, take down a bandit camp so locals can move in).

Negatives: Overall quality is "sloppy". Issues aren't game breaking but definitely lower immersion. In cut scenes characters have very little facial expressions, constantly twitch in odd ways, and move their arms around similar to how the original Thunderbirds puppets used to act. And the dialogue is often out of sync with the lips. Staff combat can feel clunky with long "heavy" swing animations taking way too long resulting in you missing your target. Terrain traversal is a little disappointing. Climbing can result in Aloy doing massively high leaps just to grab the first rung of a ladder that is not that high off the ground. The moment you hit a small rock when sprinting, Aloy stops dead until you get her to sprint again. Which is annoying when trying to get away from large machines. The same happens does refilling your health. The npcs sometimes cheat, seeing through the terrain (even those without in-built radar).

THE masterpiece from Guerrilla Games, finally available on pc !
I already played it few hours on ps4 few years ago but haven't gotten too far as i don't really enjoy playing on consoles with a controller at 30fps like a peasant anymore.

Now that the master race pc version is here it's finally time to get fully immerssed into this masterpiece.
So far so good bust i just wished the pc port was better.
Rest assured it's not an incompetent garbage console port, it does have issues but the game still remain worth buying 100%.
To give you an idea about the quality of the port well i'd say it's on par with the RDR2 pc port.
Nothing groundbreaking but also nothing to complain too much.
Main problems are the time it takes to compile shaders during the first boot of the game and the occasional micro stuttering during gameplay.
People having issues might be playing on garbage potatoes pc or are either trolls lying because so far i didn't had a single crash.

Guerrilla Games holds a very special place in my heart since the first KILLZONE, their games are truly unique and amazing.
Horizon Zero Dawn is no exception and is their best work so far with KILLZONE 2 IMO, truly an absolute showcase of talents and skills.
This game deliver one of the best open world to date, engaging story and many interesting characters to meet during the journey.
It's an amazingly well crafted universe featuring gorgeous and huge environments to explore, lot of stuff and quests to do.
The graphics are absolutely stunning, there is so many details it's mind blowing !
Gameplay wise it plays pretty well with keyboard and mouse, way better and smoother than a controller.

Quick words about the performances, with an old 1080ti i average 80/100fps with a mix of ultra and medium settings.
Ps: ♥♥♥♥ digital foundry for making people believe it was a terrible port.
I am astonished by the stupid negative review bombing going on right now, probably ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who can't maintain a gaming pc well or doesn't meet the required specs.

In the end the Horizon Zero Dawn pc version is a must have, no doubts.
Easily in the top ten of the best action/open world games ever made.
Personal opinion and to give you an idea about how good the open world is in Horizon let me rate my best single player open worlds i've seen in videogames below:

#1 red dead redemption 2
#2 horizon zero dawn
#3 the legend of zelda botw
#4 the witcher 3
#5 gta v
#6 assassin's creed

Overall Horizon Zero Dawn™ Complete Edition is a fantastic game.
Can't recommend it enough.
Rating 9/10

I wouldn't say "highly recommend" based on the current state of the PC port but sure as hell this is one of the greatest games I've ever played. And here I am 120h later starting up a NewGame+ on ultra-hard for the sake of the last 3 achievements.

PS: Had some troubles on the launch day but once I tweaked the vsync/ anisotropic filtering settings from Nvidia control panel, things were going 60ish smooth almost all the time on 1080p @ Ultra preset. So I am very much aware that this is a poor pc port but for the $16 (In Sri Lanka) spent on this, I enjoyed HZD to the best of my ability despite all the shortcomings. ✌

Really great game, especially the AI. The AI is really good. Like when you put down a tripwire robots actually jump over them! They are so smart.
Horizon Zero Dawn is a perfect proof, that if you give developers creative freedom and time, it will get you a sweet reward. For fans of action adventures and wonderful worlds Horizon is the obvious choice.

I have completed the game and the expansion content. I did most of the side activities and errands. I think I have about 90% completion. I waited till I was done to review the game.

First thing first - This port has issues, I was able to play with a smooth 4K60 using digital foundry's optomized settings and some NVCP tweaks (Vsync and Forced AF as well as setting to max performance mode) I still got occasional framedrops but for the most part was a smooth 60 for me - I know I am the exception to this and I think I was just able to brute force my way through it (3700x/2080ti/32GB 3600mhz overclocked and watercooled all devices) I wish it ran better for most people. And there are other weird issues like the hair physics and spotty snow deformation in the frozen north. I know they are working on patches and I hope they can resolve the issues. I didn't have a single crash throughout my entire 50+ hours of playtime. I know a lot of others are suffering crashes.

The game itself is amazing, I played about 8 hours on the PS4 pro when it came out and stopped due to the 30fps. Playing it at 60fps and native 4k it feels like the way the game should be played. It's a wonderful open world game with an interesting progression system and great writing and acting. The world feels like a real place. The lore is very well thought out and comes to you as the player in a very organic and natural way. I kept wanting to figure out more.

This game is amazing. I hope they patch it to make it run better without issues for more people as it's a shame such a great game has gotten such a mediocre port.

I highly recommend the game - but go in aware of the issues at this current time.

This review is specifically for India(and other developing nations). Sony started with selling this game at a price that was appropriate for the region 1200rs, and then suddenly increased the price 3300. They just want people to get used to buying games and then increase the price so they end up paying more. These sort of anti-consumer practices should not be acceptable.

So please if you're in a developing nation stop supporting this!

This game is an absolute blast and definitely recommended. That being said, performance is really an issue. My specs exceed the recommended ones but the game still crashed constantly (almost every ten minutes) when I first started playing. I tried all of the fixes recommended online - none of them worked. Eventually, I found that the default CPU and memory boost programme that came with my laptop fixed it. Given how many complaints there are about this game's performance problems, I'm guessing this game is not well optimised. However, once this problem was solved (although I still had the rare crash), this game was incredibly fun.

The good:
- great story and interesting world
- engaging combat (I don't usually like third person combat but it felt fluid once I got the hang of it)
- exploration is a lot of fun - I am not a completionist but I actually went looking for the collectibles (something I almost never do) as the world was fun to explore (aside from the annoying abundance of enemies - see below)
- great music, good voice acting and beautiful graphics
- good learning curve and progression system

The bad:
- performance problems (but enough said about that)

- too many enemies in the base game (but this was pulled back in the DLC) - this might sound like an odd complaint but you could barely walk a few metres without running into yet another group of angry machines. This was fun when I was looking for combat but an annoyance when I wanted to explore or just walk from A to B without being mobbed every few minutes. This was made worse by the fact that the enemies respawned or healed fully if you walked just a few metres away from them. It was quite immersion breaking to clear a small area of machines, walk literally a few metres away and then backtrack only to find everything had come back

- annoying UI and resource management when it comes to potions and traps - you need to scroll through a long list of items one by one to find what you need which can be lethal in combat. Some type of wheel which slows down time (like the weapon wheel maybe) would have been preferable

Horizon Zero Dawn, one of a few Sony exclusives to get a PC port, a great game in a beautiful package.

Already got the platinium on the PS4 Pro version (25h for the story/50h if you want the 100%, DLC is on another map and takes around 15h.)

Horizon Zero Dawn is a classic 3rd person view open world with a great story (including the DLC too), on the graphics side it's one of the most beautiful games of the PS4 (beaten by TLOU2 and RDR2).

In my opinion Horizon Zero Dawn is a mixture between Tomb Raider (3rd person view, gameplay mechanics, craft), FarCry Primal (atmosphere), The Witcher 3 (3rd person view, atmosphere, RPG mechanics), and some Assassins Creed (3rd person view, climbing).

The story takes place in the 31st century and follows Aloy. The world is dominated by robotics creatures : the "machines", humans on the other sides try to survive in different small groups.
Aloy is a hunter trying to discover what happen to mankind, especially why the machines are becoming more aggressive over the years and on the other side why humans have such limited access to technology.

Gameplay is where this game is really good, the battles against the machines are a lot of fun and got a lot of possibilities (especially the big one like the Thunderjaw or Stormbird), combats with humans are on the other side really poor.
The games has no vehicle except that Aloy can ride some machines like a horse (yay).
The game has a lot of collectibles, but there are not required to progress in the story.
OST and sounds are also great.

The game consumes a lot GPU power, Ryzen 3700X + 32Gb RAM + GTX1080 here and I got like 45fps average with the high settings on a 21/9 screen at 3440*1440.
For the moment it also got a lot of stuttering, and it crash randomly (I bet a patch we'll be released soon).
You can expect to gain some FPS if you tweak some useless options (wait for a full guide like RDR2 got), or to the devs to increase the performance.

At 50€ if you are looking for this game since it was released on the PS4 or if you want a great story/gameplay/graphics then it's worth it. If not, then wait for a discount.

Overall this game is my TOP5 PS4 exclusive games, among God Of War, TLOU2, Ghost of Tsushima, and Days Gone, maybe one day we'll get these on Steam.

Well this was a sh1tshow
My original review was at launch and extremely negative because the game was just huge broken terrible mess. Fast forward ~2years later and I give it another try and it's better now, it still has some problems but it's nothing compared to the mess it was.
When it comes to the game it's good but it's nothing special. It's a reskined Far Cry Primal with 3rd person camera and female protagonist with added witcher tracking and wither sense( aka focus). Don't get me wrong this is a good thing but this is what the game is.



My original negative rating review below
Why didn't they delay this release is mind boggling to me
Wait, just wait don't buy it yet. The state the game is in is just broken on so man lvl's. There is no way they didn't know it's in such a bad state, My first ever steam refund request( and I own 2k+ games on steam that's how sad I'am about this port). If you think 1-2-3patches will fix this think again, this is so broken it's ganna take at least 1-2 months....
When it's fixed i'll gladly go back to it but right now evade it at any cost.



Update 1 day later: I got denied for a steam refund even though I never asked for one up till then and didn't play HZD for more then 2h, this makes no sense @Valve...........

To review this game in its current state, we need to talk about the port and the game separately. The game itself is a beautifully crafted open-world RPG with stunning graphics, awesome soundtrack, satisfying and rewarding combat which requires stealth/strategy and most importantly, a unique and thought-provoking story with a futuristic theme. The expansion adds a lot of content to an already huge game too.

The port on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired. I'm usually not the person to care much about graphics, but there was just a lot of pop-in and textures/polygons not loading which was very noticeable. There were a lot of stutters/frame drops and a few crashes in between too. I would definitely recommend buying this game after there are a few more patches and the game is in a fully optimised state. Here's hoping to Sony releasing more of their exclusives on Steam!

Horizon - Zero "Optimization"

I will recommend this game only if optimization and crash fix patch is released.

P.S. Guerrilla for real!? You had plenty of time to make it bug-free - but not, you have failed it.
Hope you are smart enough to make the "day, week, month" - ONE patch.

UPD: So the Crash Fix have been founded in the other Steam comments. (Nope, crashed again on the next day)

For that download and install the "GeForce Hotfix Driver Version 451.85". And may the Force be with you!

UPD2: So, now after a couple of patches (performance and crash fixes) I can recommend this game - now is the time to buy it and enjoy this beautiful game with amazing atmosphere=)

After all the trouble of the bugs of launch, this game is now in his best version yet.
The graphics are amazing, along with the awesome gameplay and atmosphere you get through all the game.
The open world and the story are great, just like Sony used us to in the games of this generation, and so many hours you can put in.
If you are in doubt, get it.

If you dont mind finding an optimization guide, and tweaking some things, (45 minutes for myself) you can get it running at 80-110fps on a 2080 super, max settings, 1440p relatively easily.

Visuals are great with the exception of the shader and texture issues, the story is amazing, combat feels awesome and fresh compared to other games ive played lately.

I heavily reccomend this game, but only because i trust the developers are actively trying to fix the issues plaguing it. If in 2 weeks tops they have not actively fixed the major bugs i will edit this review to not recommending this game.

Look, I'm a guy who LOVES open world RPG's. I mean my favorite games are RDR2, Witcher 3, and Skyrim. So when I heard that a open world RPG with a supposed great story, awesome characters and engaging gameply was coming out, I was ecstatic. But... I just couldn't get into it.

The characters: One of the main things I had heard was that Aloy the protagonist was an enjoyable protagonist. Yet throughout the entire game I could never connect with her. It seems like she both has 3 personalities and 1 at the same time. I think this is due to the fact that sometimes in the game it will give you one of 3 options for dialogue: the agressive option, the intelligent option, and the compassionate option. Because they do this it means that in other dialogue points where you don't chose what to say they try and incorporate all of the personalities at once this leads the character to feeling unrealistic and like someone you can't connect with. Now there was really only one character I liked in the game, because he was the only person who had any personality. Erend was fun and reminded me of Patrick Star weilding a War Hammer. Other than that characters also just interacted weirdly, at the begining in her home tribe everybody hates Aloy, and it makes it interesting as you feel like she's constantly trying to fit in, while also hating the people she wants to fit in with. But... This is ruined after a couple hours in the game. As soon as you leave the main village literally EVERYONE except for like 2 people in the whole game just kiss the ground beneath Aloy's feet and act like she is the second coming of Christ. But that's enough about characters.

World: The world is pretty meh. For an open world game there isn't very much to do throughout your travels. I mean sure you'll run into a herd of machines every 10 seconds but most of the time you can just run past them. However, I think there were only 3 side quests I came across organically while traveling the world. All the others were just by rando mcgee in some city town or village just asking wonderful Aloy for help because she can do everything. And then all of the side quests are boring as hell. The only side quest I found remotely interesting was Erend's, and that's listed under main missions so it doesn't even count. All the other side quests are just fetch quests, or going to a place using your focus, going to the next place using your focus, etc... Eventually I got tired of side ♥♥♥♥ and decided to do the main mission as that was what I had heard the most praise for.

The story: The story just feels bland. I was really intrigued by the beginning as it gave Aloy obvious ways to change, and a reason to do what she was doing. But as I said, after about 2 hours they ruin it and remove any personal motivation. Now it's just about saving the world, but she has no personal stakes in the matter. Imagine if Geralt didn't have Ciri to save, and he was just fighting the Wild Hunt because that's how he saves the world. Imagine if Frodo didn't have the need to protect his friends. Imagine if Luke didn't have to save his father. That's how this game feels, Aloy just needs to save the world because... she's the protagonist I guess. The story would have been much more interesting if: So yea I couldn't care less for the story.

graphics: the graphics are nice, but because the PC port was a bit ♥♥♥♥ unless you turn down the graphics and do a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ even if you have a super high end PC it is very difficult to get 60 fps.

Gameplay: The combat is meh. It's a primarily ranged system that incorporates dodge rolls. You basically just dodge enemy attacks and shoot the week spots highlighted for you by the focus, and use whatever element the enemy is week to until their health reaches zero (this was on hard difficulty maybe on the hardest it's more enjoyable). Personally I couldn't really get into it but I was kind of expecting that since I tend to prefer melee combat (which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ in this game). Overall it's just a boring system. Then we get into override, the main thing I was hyped for was riding robot dinosaurs. So imagine my disappointment when there are only 3 mounts in the game, but in actuality there is only 1 as the other 2 are literally only different by their horns on their head which do zero in the gameplay department. Not to mention that the mount system is awful in this game. The mounts barely turn, can't jump at all, and won't go on pretty much any incline, not to mention you have to completely stop just to pick up some plants (even if you have the perk that lets you gather while mounted you still stop completely) and mounts make it impossible to stealth. It's cool overriding other machines to fight for you but half the time it's just better to kill everything in stealth mode (the only fun part of the gameplay) and just skip overriding in general. And then there's the parkour, it has classic playstation parkour where the character can only climb specific yellow colored objects and NOTHING else for no reason, making world traversing way more annoying considering all the mountains and cliffs all around. It would've been better had they either not added a parkour system, made one similar to games like Witcher 3 where it is very minor and just works on anything to move a bit better, or had a fully fledged out system like AC or Dying Light. Again another meh for this department.

Overall opinion and review: 5/10, it's average at best. It seems to work for a lot of people, but I can't get into it for the life of me. I really wanted to like this game but I just couldn't. It was so mediocre in every department that it honestly felt like a chore to complete. It's not a bad game, but I can't recommend that you buy a game for $60 that's just average when there are so many better games for the same or lower price. If you want a good game with any of these then buy one of these games instead:

Witcher 3(or the whole series honestly), RDR2, Skyrim, Fallout New Vegas, Assassin's Creed (1, 2, brotherhood, revelations, black flag, origins), Arkham (city, Knight, Asylum), Cyberpunk, Nier Automata, Far Cry series,, Mass effect trilogy(legendary edition is all 3 games and is the same price as this), dragon age, Jedi Fallen Order, Halo, bioshock trilogy, Dark Souls, GTA V, Force Unleashed, KOTOR, and so many more.

Buggy as hell. Have a fairly high end pc and HZD crashes roughly every 30 minutes or so. I could live with that, but with the absence of a quick save feature, I'll probably be shelving this game and playing something that is actually stable. Avoid buying until it's fully patched and maybe wait until a seasonal sale before risking it.

For context, I can't recall another game I've played in the past several years having the performance issues this one does.

Look I bought the game because I thought they would deliver great PC port with all DLCs and stuff since they advertised it as such in their Steam News and as it was advertised in various articles on internet as being "amazing PC experience". And what we got? We got poor port, with stutters, crashes, fps drops, broken VFX and random black textures pop ins.

So here I am waiting - like an idiot - for some siginificant patches that gonna drop very soon, still hoping they would fix their game up - still giving them benefit of the doubt that it was just poor initial execution that's gonna be fixed in a matter of time. 3 weeks have passed and there's no major fixes to any of the issues people are experiencing...

I'm sure the game is great, but these Devs which were in charge of porting the game just look very incompetent so far... and I can't see this changing in any near future.

SO...i pushed through it...took a different approach of, booting it up and going on my business and when i returned to my pc, it loaded, then it was enjoyable.
As i wrote below, i love the game: combat, characters, graphics, upgrades, sound, music, all are great.
Solid action game and im looking fwd to forbidden west...
Left my original "review below" why i didnt recommend it first time around

Played 20h for now and i can barely bring myself to boot it up again.
Shame because i love the game but every time you start it, is a 10-15 min shader optimization screen...EVERY TIME
Sometimes it starts afterwards running around 40fps, sometimes it is a constant 60.
Every time you boot it up is a gamble, maybe it runs ok, maybe it runs abysmal...never saw anything like this in a video game.
Doubt Sony will ever patch this but it i a horrible PC port and when something isn't working, no matter how good "it might be", i cannot recommend it.

Enjoyed the story. Good game.
Terribly Optimised.
Crashed a lot towards the end of the campaign.

But we finished it in the end.

I'd play more. But the game seems adamant to crash on me a lot. So maybe another time.

Great game, but bad port.

Playing this from day one with a monster system; 16 core 4.5GHz i9 processor, 128GB DDR4 RAM, 24GB Titan RTX Graphics card, and game is installed on a G3 NVME SSD rated for 3.5GB/sec. Even then, running on high settings (not ultra) delivers only a constant 80fps at 1440p res, getting as high as 150fps at points, and low as 65fps. To put into context, I can run Death Stranding which is the same game engine as Horizon Zero Dawn, at a constant 180fps. Doom Eternal runs on my system at a constant 200fps, so the issues very much strike me as bad/lack of optimisation.

The game itself has great characters, compelling story and world to lose yourself in, which genuinely always has you saying “I’ll play for just 5 minutes more” when you’re looking to end your session, and you keep going regardless. The only aspect holding this game back is the bad quality of port to PC that it is. In its current state, it is a monster resource hog, especially to your GFX card and CPU.

If you’re able to stomach sticking this game down to medium/low settings, or you just have the raw power to get past the current issues, then I can recommend you buy this now and it’ll be even better once it’s patched. For those with PCs skirting either the minimum or recommended specs, I strongly suggest you wait until patches are released, or try for an hour and consider a refund if you have performance issues.

Technical issues aside, this is Witcher 3 levels of good, so overall I will label it as recommended, but as a numbered review, I can only give this a 7 out of 10 due to the technical problems presently outstanding with it.

I found that Horizon Zero Dawn suffers from the same problems that most open world games have. The main problem being the lack of actual exploration. It feels like the game is open world for the sake of being open world, and not because the game wouldn't have worked otherwise. It has the classic Assassin's Creed tower system, which removes all sense of discovery from the player. "Towers" are already marked on the map and, once you climb them, everything in that area is also put onto your map. Because of this, you look at the map and pick a marker instead of looking at the landscape and going to a point of interest. The game has beautiful scenery, but I had no reason to study and admire the scenery because the map already had everything I needed to see.
Another issue I had with the game was the combat. You're provided with several tools to strategize before you engage the enemy, and to adapt if things don't go to plan. Unfortunately, most of the ten or so weapon types are simply not as good as others. Throughout the entire game, I only used two different weapons and was never met with an enemy that forced me to change my approach (this was on the second highest difficulty setting). Even worse than this weapon imbalance, in my opinion, was the lack of variety in melee weapons. By this I mean that there is literally no variety. You start with a spear and that's it for the rest of the game. This wouldn't be so bad if the spear had some actual depth to it, but it doesn't. You're better off not even using it in most encounters.
Those issues aside, Horizon Zero Dawn is a beautifully crafted game with breathtaking scenes and creative, unique creature designs. The world itself pulls you in and keeps you captivated. It's truly a work of art. Shame the gameplay isn't on the same level.

This game has a solid story, plenty of challenges, but not too difficult. I enjoy a good adventure unlike many games today who use profanity and sex to sell their product. I would not have a problem having a child play this game.

I beat HZD on PS4 and I'm very happy to revisit it on the PC. Most of the major issues have been sorted, leaving behind a solid PC port. I would say overall the port is a bit heavier than it should be still (a PC that can usually match the PS4 or PS4 Pro would probably struggle at equivalent settings), but at least the issues reported at launch have been addressed.

Graphically, the game was fine tuned for the PS4 specifically and plays to its strengths. You'll see this everywhere, in the way the geometry is very detailed but mostly static, with clothing and hair clipping into character models as they move. The world is carefully designed to push detail as high as possible on a CPU limited platform. The extra level of detail the PC port can bring will lift only a few of the console limitations - the poor texture filtering and LOD systems can be brute forced here, leading to a more consistent image. But it's merely a step up, not revelatory. Don't expect the PC version here to look like the Forbidden West trailers.

I'll also note that the original game seemed to have a weakness in animation across the board, which was largely addressed in the Frozen Wilds DLC content but was not backported to the rest of the game. Once you enter the DLC region, you'll notice conversations and cutscenes look a solid step above the main game. While I would have liked to see the weaker animations polished up in the main game, especially addressing facial animation and the static-feeling conversations, it's still servicable as-is.

That being said, this game still has substantial strengths that make it one of the best of the generation. The writing and plot is among the best in video games - information is doled out at a perfect pace, and I found myself genuinely compelled and curious about not just the past but the present. The game's lore and world building are top tier, and the way it allows the player to delve into the details is second to none. It's rare we see a first game in a franchise where all of the major questions and world details are addressed, while also delivering on an epic sweeping main quest with both solid protagonists and antagonists. The game spends most of its time constrained in scope, building up to a truly epic final act. This is a masterclass and manages to pull off an incredible amount and quality of story work in merely 30 hours.

The combat and exploration also feel great. At 60 fps the game feels even better, with a great variety of combat options and satisfying animations. The traversal tends to feel pretty small scope and intimate - the game strikes a great balance between a world with vast possibilities while remaining digestable in a small amount of time.

I love to see this game on PC where improved hardware can improve the graphical quality, if only marginally. But regardless, this is a fantastic game and I'm extremely happy to see that more people will be able to play it.

I'm immensely disappointed with this port. It had been ~3 years since this game came out yet there seems to have been no practical improvement in visuals from the PS4 version. Texture quality is abysmal in both 1440p and 4K HDR. Texture/Model popping in were also common when installed on an HDD rather than an SSD. There was also a number of graphical glitches I've experienced in the first 3 hours of the game. However, the extremely poor performance is what really grinded my gears :(

On a laptop with an i9 and a 2070, 1080p performance in the highest settings, stutters every 10-20 seconds was common.

On my main rig with an i9 and SLI 2080 Ti's, 4K and 1440p performance was just as bad as the laptop with stutters that are extremely irritating in the platforming segments.

How exactly did Guerilla mess this up even when they used the Decima Engine which ran Death Stranding on PC beautifully??! I really wanted to experience Horizon's beautiful world again with the hopes that powerful hardware on PC would be used to their greatest extent but was left disappointed.

PS: really crossing my fingers that modders eventually make Stormbirds mountable

Hozion Zero Dawn is one of the best open world game experiences I've had the pleasure to play.

The story is great, the game-play is smooth as butter & the environments are just perfect. The land is vast and diverse with every moment of this game being a screenshot waiting to be made. Now there are some flaws. Characters look a bit lifeless at times, especially in the facial animation department, but the voice acting will help to resolve that for you. Otherwise I can't really give Horizon any other bits of criticism. The game is just strait up fun, Nothing is too hard to understand, menus are complex yet simple enough to wrap your mind around, old school weapons have a refreshing modern take on them which makes them feel comfortable to use & the game does a great job at not overly sexulising their main protagonist to try drag in more of the male audience, which I actually appreciate & respect quite a bit. This game won't hold your hand and nether will Aloy, so keep your focus on the robots & enjoy a brilliant world of exploration.

First impression (11hours in)

25 Euros on sale for this?! That's a bargain!, Well worth it's full price aswell. Very few games that have me hooked for hours at a time.

If you like Sci-fi this, this is absolutely a no brainer to get. intriguing story, Well filled open world that doesn't feel like a lot of nothing between the action, and Side quests that kept me from progressing the main story for hours (that's a good thing).

No bugs or issues so far, runs great.


Finished Main game + DLC around 84hours


So i did most of the things this game and dlc had to offer, the story had me hooked all the way through this game, and the story had me reading through every bit of text i came across, which in games, I don't normaly bother with.
The collectibles in this game add value to the game it's self, with gear and usable items + actual interesting lore attached to them, collectibles done right, if i'd say so myself.

Game mechanics: Works more or less flawlessly all the way throughout. The one thing that i'll complain about is getting out of water in some instances can be a bit wonky, but there are so few times, i'd let that slide.

Final words: I love how this game manage to be a medieval and sci-fi game in one go.

One of the worst ports ever. It feels like a cheap cashgrab. I never had so many problems with any game, and i have over 1500. Terrible FPS and FPS-Drops even through my pc is over the recommended specs. Countless crashes. Every time the game crashes it takes up to 5 minutes til you can start the game again even through there is no process running anymore. It certainly is not worth the asking price right now. DONT BUY.

"It cant be that bad, My rig is good enough" I told myself.. 2 hours in and it is completely unplayable. I can't finish the tutorial boss because it keeps crashing.

Beautiful game, but until they fix it, stay far away.

The most pleasant surprise to me in 2020, Horizon Zero Dawn went beyond my expectations. Although plagued by technical issues upon release, I luckily didn't experience many of those, and had a great journey with the game. Since then, many of those issues were ironed out with patches. I don't want to write a full review here, as many already did in better quality as I could, so I'll just point out some things that were highlights for me
The story:
Although starts off slow, and a bit clunky at parts, overall it's a satisfying tale, and it really picks up around the middle. From then on, I was playing almost without stop, because I wanted to know the conclusion. And the conclusion is great too, which in no small part stems from the fact...
The characters:
...the player character, Aloy, actually has a character arc, and if you become invested in the story, she grows on you, and you root for her. She is easily the best written female protagonist in years, without any preachy feminist undertones. She is strong and determined, but has flaws and a softer side to her as well, so as much as in this genre possible, the writers made her relateable and likable. Another great character is Sylens, but I won't spoil his role here
Also, the voicework for these two are also nailed. The VAs are Ashly Burch and Lance Reddick, respectively, and add to the characters significantly.
The gameplay and graphics:
The game belongs to the nowadays oh-so-popular action adventure genre, but I don't say that as a downside. It's also open world, and has RPG elements, which are also rather frequent qualities nowadays. With that said, Horizon delivers, with a beautifully crafted open world, that is probably the best looking game in years. In 4K, it's truly stunning, with breathtaking vistas, and gorgeous lighting effects. Post-apocaliptic America never looked better. The design for the machine creatures are creative, and they are richly detailed.
And here I will say that the combat in HZD is sick, and if you play on at least normal, it will challange you. It's a healthy challange though, and this is a thinking man's game. You won't survive against the toughest machines with just using your bow and arrows, you have to use all your tools at your disposal to down, say, a Ravager or a Trampler. To say nothing about the feared Thunderjaw. The one notable criticism I have is the melee combat. Aloy has a spear that she can strike enemies with, but the hit detection is imprecise, and overall feels rather clunky. I also missed some sort of parry or block against human enemies, as these are the ones where I felt I could spare my arrows and just strike them down without dying in the process, but I often found myself running away, and using my bow from some distance anyway. It's almost as if close combat was an afterthought from the devs, and was added at the last moment
Overall:
The game was fun, and it still is, as I didn't even touch the DLC yet. If the main game was any indication, it will be a doozy as well, but it's still a big RECOMMEND even if I only look at the base game. Although for my personal GOTY2020 Doom Eternal and Ori were already contenders, now there is another. I can only hope the incoming sequel, The Forbidden West, will come for PC too some time down the line

DISCLAIMER
The review you are about to read is based on my own experience with the game, my judgment, and the rating system! No third party has impacted anything said in this review. This review is also 100% spoiler-free, so you don't need to worry about that either.

Gameplay and Interaction (16 out of 20)
The gameplay is probably the most enjoyable part. Most of the encounters require preparation to get through, which might be frustrating for people that are used to the button-mashing. As far as the interaction goes, there's nothing groundbreaking, it's the typical stuff you're most likely already tired of seeing. Unlocking a specific area of the map, hunting grounds, collectibles, focus mode, bandit camps - everything you'll find in other games as well, so, there's nothing new like I was told there would be. A lot of people told me that there's a lot of new gameplay mechanics they haven't seen before, which is wrong on so many levels.

I haven't discovered a single thing that has not been already overused in other games, which only tells me that the people I got this intel from are either very biased or haven't played many similar games. There are a ton of objectives to complete throughout the map, but most of the less important ones are oversimplified. I jumped into this game with high expectations of encountering something I haven't seen before, which initially lead to a lot of disappointment. Please, just don't expect groundbreaking gameplay mechanics or diverse side quests. Most of the side quests emphasize the slow and methodical approach just to prolong the playtime and are used for a more pleasant level-up. Fast travel packs are thankfully a thing and are easy to obtain, which saved me a lot of worthless traversals.

Graphics and Sound Quality (18 out of 20)
I was truly impressed at the amount of detail on display. The world is split into sections: foliage dense regions with a ton of grass swinging around, waste desert areas with nothing but rocks as far as the eye can see, snowy areas with limited visibility, etc. The render distance of foliage is bearable while traversing the world on foot, but as soon as you override a machine and start moving a tad bit faster - all you'll be able to see is foliage growing instantly from the ground. The sound design and effects are pretty good. The score is memorable enough that you'll be able to pinpoint which game it's from even in ten years.

Performance and Optimization (18 out of 20)
This is a tricky part. There are a ton of people that have experienced all sorts of issues regarding performance. Yes, these issues have been resolved by various updates by now, so there's nothing to worry about. I, on the other hand, haven't had a single game-breaking issue. The game crashed only once during the first boot. I hate stutters and all sorts of things that make my game freeze, but at this point, all of the stutter issues that have been present at release are fixed. As far as the rest of the stuff goes, I haven't had any major issues, thus I can't say that I've had a bad time regardless of what other people were experiencing. The only thing that I don't understand is how demanding the game is, but since the world is massive and mostly full of detail - I can accept it. I hope DLSS will be implemented in one of the future updates as it would be very useful to achieve higher FPS.

Story and Content Value (18 out of 20)
The story is another segment of the game I kind of expected more from. It started strongly, and I thought it would set the pace for what comes after. Once the initial sequence came to an end, everything slowed down, and all the excitement disappeared. Everyone who had played the game on PS4 before the PC release has told me that this game has the best story of any video game. The story isn't all that uninteresting but does feel flat at times - like nothing is happening. Keep an eye on all these collectibles and data-thingies, otherwise, you might completely lose interest. I think the problem lies in uninteresting characters that you meet at the very start, not that the later ones are any better, but the first couple of them you meet are dull. There simply wasn't enough drive in the first portion of the story to push me to continue pursuing the main quests since most of the outcomes are highly predictable. What's the point of uncovering what the future has to offer if 10/10 times I was able to predict the outcome? 90% of the characters are lifeless, and it seems like someone drained every single aspect of life out of their bodies. They'll just look you in the eyes and spit some dialogue like zombies.

Some of the main quests are very interesting later on, but most of the time it is: go from point A-to-B, discover something, then returning to point A and report back. There's not much along the way to entertain you either other than the machines that are just standing there waiting for your attack turn so they can respond. Side quests are mostly repetitive stuff, doing the same thing over and over again, but at least you get to explore the world and hunt collectibles. Some quests in the game reminded me of ReCore: Definitive Edition, which felt odd - considering that the same types of quests were (in my opinion) often better handled in ReCore. I know I keep comparing Horizon: Zero Dawn to other games, but I'm just sharing my own experience, considering that whatever I've heard from other people - the game time and time again proves to me otherwise.

The value you're getting from this game is enough to justify even the full price. The fact is that the game itself isn't too long to grow tired of overtime, which is a huge bonus in my opinion. It should take anywhere between 20-30 hours to finish just the story, and between 60-80 hours to complete the game twice and 100% it. I was told to pick the normal difficulty level for my first playthrough, and I've made a mistake. All the games I play, I just crank up to the highest difficulty level and almost effortlessly progress through it, in this case, I thought the game is on the Dark Souls level of hard, but it isn't. The encounters aren't challenging if you strategize just a little bit, and running right into encounters without a second of prior planning will most definitely get you killed. I just wish people would stop hyping and being so biased towards certain brands' exclusive games when they don't offer anything superior to other 3rd party titles. Seems like it's forbidden to criticize these games like they're some kind of a national treasure.

Animations and Movement Controls (16 out of 20)
Now, let's talk about animations. I'm so sad to say it like this, but the animation work in dialogue is just... let me use an adequate word here: wicked. I won't be too harsh, but some things are just horrifying to look at. I've also experienced weird glitches such as Aloy's eyes growing to the point of an anime girl when it's raining and some weird hand & face movements on other characters during dialogue. Some of these issues have been resolved though, but from time to time a few still find their way into the gameplay. At least the controls are perfect, and you won't find yourself jumping into certain death.

Final Score and Conclusion (86 out of 100)
Horizon: Zero Dawn is a great game if you ignore all the hype Sony warriors created. It's a decent game, but simply not as good as some people believe it to be. Do yourself a favor and don't expect miracles. I, myself have fallen victim to other people constantly bragging about how good the game is, while it's just another immersive open-world title. In the end, all that matters is that the game has finally come to the PC, and I'm hoping that Sony will finally realize that there are PC gamers that don't buy consoles just to play one or two games.

I cannot stress this ENOUGH!

Do not buy this game at it's current state. Wait for the developers to fix the problems with stuttering during cutscenes AND gameplay along with the constant crashes. My game crashed within the first 15 seconds into the gameplay. This game is a real masterpiece, and deserves all the praise that it's gotten. Unfortunately, the PC port that we've gotten is not on par with the game itself.

Buy it later, please!

This game exceeded my expectations. I was wary knowing it was a port but I played the entire game using mouse and keyboard and I have zero complaints about the controls or user interface.

I thoroughly enjoyed the game and got 56 hours of gameplay from the first playthrough. I'm still impressed and might start a second playthrough. It's exactly the kind of game I'll remember 20 years from now and probably be comparing everything else I play to it in the future.

Hey Mikey, he likes it!

Excellent game play, rich story, controls make sense, beautiful graphics....I could go on and on. Plus, there's a "New Game+" feature that lets you start a new game with items and skills you acquired in a previous game! I'm only about 10% through the game, so I haven' gotten a chance to try it out..but I still love what I've seen so far. The only con I have is the game crashed on me once at startup, but no data was lost and it reloaded just fine, so it ended up being a minor inconvenience.

I highly recommend this game and can't wait until the sequel comes to PC. All-Mother be blessed!

I bought a PS4 for this game quite a few years back!
Now, being able to experience the game for the 5th time on a PC with proper Graphics settings, HDR and in Ultra Wide 32:9 Aspect Ratio - 5120x1440 (thanks to Pcgamingwiki) all I can say is that THUMBS UP!

A TRULY WONDERFUL GAME, which I think everyone should experience!

Looking forward to the next Chapter on the PS5 ;)

I highly recommend this game.
There's a catch though, a lot of people are having performance and technical issues with the PC port.
I'm glad I haven't had a single crash in the game since I started playing (I'm now at 56 hours played), but that's not true for everyone right now.

Possible technical issues aside, the game is amazing for everyone who enjoy a good openworld game with interesting lore and awesome story!

Alright, after invested quite some time in HZD, I decided using this review to answer some of the hottest discussions friends asked me a lot. In hope it will do to help you out for the purchase decisions.

Q: Is HZD poorly optimized?
A: I personally believe HZD currently is having some major issues across variety builds PCs however, DEFINITELY not high-end PCs like mine in this case. I don’t have any performance issues in game, all max-out settings on, the game looks just as amazing as I expected on a PC should be. However, I do have some issues with my Nintendo Switch Pro controller when in game, eg. Menu button doesn’t work, experiencing disconnection some times. But since NSP is not a major controller, and Sony doesn’t like it, decided to cast it out ╮(╯▽╰)╭ no surprise, while if you are using PS DS controller or Xbox controllers, you should be pretty good to go. Wait a bit longer to see what happens.

Q: How is the gameplay?
A: Triple A title standard no doubt. In case if you are not aware, Death Stranding shares the same engine as HZD, it is exact the reason why HZD is such a beautiful charming world when the graphic settings are right. It is also an enormous open world with tons of things to do in game: many different type of quests, collectibles(not solely for your hobby, you exchange them to the merchant for very rare equipment), vast area to explore, eye-open enemies to kill, hidden eastern eggs to discover, all apart from main objectives. In short, you will be very busy. Story is interesting, so far have no ideas how this is going to end. If you like game like Assassins’ Creed: Odyssey, you will like HZD for a similar fashion.

Q: Any annoying plug-ins?
A: No in game apps purchase, no multiple players mode meaning no skins tricks, as far as I know, no Denuvo(I very appreciate this one, this game is a masterpiece even solely for the collectibles purposes). All set, DLCs included.

Q: Your recommendations?
A: At least wait for Guerrilla fixing current performance issues, making HZD be able to run fairly OK on the average building machines, if you want to buy it without inside the risking range. I’d recommend to buy it when a big sale hits for reasons a) HZD itself might be a masterpiece of work, but the business behind it might make you think twice before supporting it. A 3-year game hits PC with price rose even twice in some regions, make it fairly too expensive to reach out for some gamers. All the sole purpose is to lure PC gamers to buy a PS5, not putting any heart or love to further support games meant to be played by the audiences as much as they can without limiting to a special platform. b)the idea of hunting machine isn’t HZD’s origin, there’s a game called Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, in case you’ve never heard of it, despite my long out-of-date review didn’t recommend it which isn’t correct now, EOTTW is a great game no less than HZD while bonding the similar concept for a lot earlier time, besides not an open world setting. But it’s cheaper, enjoyable, generally a good choice if you ask me while killing some time before HZD hits a sale or fixed performance issues.

Q: Last question, a sentence to sum the game?
A: Raised by the tribe thought myself was a barbarian, later found unidentified flying creatures soaring above my head, shocked. Can’t shoot them again, 2nd one stays in a white alien box, not going to PC on earth forever. A civilization is lost. Again.

I know that this may end up as a unpopular opinion, but I was not impressed at all by Horizon Zero Dawn.

Sure, the game had some good moments, but overall I found it very plain and boring. Let me start by saying that I played close to 60 hours (main game + DLC) and managed to see and touch almost everything the game has to offer. I will try to keep the spoilers to a minimum.

Graphically the game looks great, there are a good amount of graphical options included and I’m glad that they caved in and included the FOV slider because it really helps (at least for me). There are the unfortunate texture pop-ins, but it doesn’t happen often enough for it to be a problem.

The story starts great, but the more you play, the more watered down it gets. Halfway through, the game goes full “man bad, women good” which seems like a forced narrative. While I generally have no issues with the thought of it, this trope should be used extremely carefully as it can be detrimental to the lore and world-building. The story gets better in the Frozen Wilds DLC and it’s one of the only parts that I found interesting and enjoyable.

Gameplay wise it suffers from the Assassin’s Creed syndrome a little bit, where most of the tasks are the same, the only difference is the location on the map. There are touches of lazy writing, the most apparent of them being the couple of side (and main) characters that die as soon as you meet them. I swear this happened like 6 times in my playthrough, I was notified of a character who was already presumed “dead”, then we find out that the said character is actually alive. We go through hell and back, kill a ton of people to rescue them, only so they can die immediately in a cutscene. This is an easy exit that the developers decided to take because before the DLC the game didn’t allow for you to have a companion that can follow you back to your destination, so they just decide to…kill them off. This ruins the character impact on the story, even making them insignificant in the eyes of the player.
I have to say that the DLC majorly improves on all these points, including a more diverse side quest selection. The game also suffers from a “no decision policy”, you would think that in a title of this magnitude your choices will actually matter? Well, too bad, because the game holds your hand during the whole experience. The only exception being the couple of times when you decide whether to kill or spare a selected character. I think the freedom of choice would’ve greatly improved the gameplay experience as there were couple of moments in which I found myself asking the game to please let me make my own decisions and not follow the linear path that it had already set for me.

The PC port is horrendous, it has numerous issues with optimization, bugs, crashes and overall bad performance which are yet to be solved as of this post. Guerilla released 2 patches, but none of the big issues were fully addressed. I don’t think they will be able to fully fix this title if they don’t decide to release like a 30GB+ patch. In my experience during the 58 hours that I have played, I had 1 crash, but the performance was really poor at some locations. It is strange that a game that came out in 2017 is faced with such issues.

I had this on the PS4 for the longest time, never really had time to try it, so when I saw that it’s coming out on PC couple of months ago, I was excited to try it with M&K and 144 fps. Sad to say that this didn’t work out and I don’t fully understand the hype that it gets from the PlayStation community. Horizon Zero Dawn could’ve been something great, but it falls short off the mark. If you are interested in this title, please follow the situation with the updates that it’s getting or at least wait for a Steam sale.

To be honest, this game was my life for the days I played this. When I bought it in the sale some time ago i installed it because of it dusting away in my library.

This is a good game, hands down. Its worth the asking price

(In the words of Angry Joe)- I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love this game. Had my eye on this one since it came out in 2017 for the PS as there was a lot of hype and positivity surrounding the game. So as soon as it was announced for PC, i knew i had to get this one.

First things first, the game is beautiful. Environment wise, this is one of the best well designed and detailed open world in a game ever. The blending of nature with the remnants of the so called "metal world" is some really good stuff and well melded together. Next the overall gameplay and combat is very satisfying and hard hitting and the designs and varieties of the different robots you can find out in the world are really cool. Exploration of the world is overall a very fun experience in the game.

The story/plot of the game is overall really well done and handled and Aloy is hands down one of the best female protagonists of recent times. The story had a sort of mystery feeling to it and it made me wanna keep playing so i could unveil the secrets of the world and of Aloy. Some of the side characters are quite interesting too but not quite on the level of Aloy. The side quests also are a hit or miss sometimes and not quite on the level of the other top tier open world games.
By the time i finished the story, it left me satisfied and complete and made me more excited for the sequel which i pray comes to PC too.(note: as of this moment i haven't yet started the expansion yet so i look forward to see how that goes)

Now on to the technical issues the game come out to. I was luckily one of the few who did not have issues specifically the crashes which a lot of people were having including some of my friends. But i did have instances of low fps and stuttering at the initial release. But with the release of the patches the game seems to be working quite smooth now. With all that being said i think this game is definitely worth a purchase. Its one of the better open world games of recent time.

Overall Rating - 8.5/10

Don't understand the hype at all. I'd go into each and every facet but honestly in my experience, the only upsides are its relatively pretty graphics, and its world building which is genuinely stellar but painfully underutilised. Everything else from its personality vacuum/straight up unlikeable characters, to its combat system that somehow makes fighting enormous mechanical dinosaurs feel underwhelming at every turn, can't be called anything but subpar, at least in my eyes.

Never found a Playstation Studios title so utterly bland before, with the admittedly incredible world building, this could end up being a foundation for a much much better game in The Forbidden West, but until then, that remains to be seen and I can't recommend you play this janky boredom fest

This game is not ready for PC as of 10AUG2020. There are workarounds and I've tried most of them. There having to be workarounds to get a game to work is rather ridiculous. These "solutions" have given me more time before crashing randomly again however, it is still happening frequently enough to make me wish I had not purchased this game yet. The developers are reportedly working frantically to find a fix and it's only been a few days since release so there's hope. Until there is a legitimate fix I think I'll just leave this one alone.

The annoying crashing aside... it's a decent game. Controls are a bit clunky but it's a console game so yeah, I assume that's expected for most players for a pc port. Not always the case but certainly is with this one. There is a bit of grind to it for various materials but it's not that bad. You get most of them and not even realize it while moving to various objectives.

Due to the technical errors I can't give this game a thumbs up. It's too big of an annoyance to overlook. If not for that I would give the game a thumbs up but just barely.

This game is absolutely amazing! The graphics are incredible and the story line is very intriguing and well-thought-out. The setting in this post-apocalyptic world makes for some incredible game play. There's so much about this game that makes it great, especially the world itself and the creatures that reside in it. Definitely one of the best games I've ever played. Can't wait for Horizon Forbidden West. I'm excited to see the new challenges Aloy is faced with. Also the raptor-like machines that you'll be able to ride! Those looked cool. Horizon Zero Dawn is truly amazing and is for sure my favourite game. If you like an open world game with an interesting story line and exciting challenges then this will probably become your favourite game as well. I'm very happy the developers were able to come up with such an amazing idea for a game and that they were able to make it happen.

I understand that people expected better performance since Death Stranding ran better and had DLSS 2.0, but honestly, I wouldn't say it's such a bad port. On a Ryzen 5 3600, 32gb and a 2060 Super, I get a locked 60fps at 1080p, which is enough for me. Running everything on max except for clouds and shadows, which I lowered to High.

There's an issue with anisotropic filtering that can be solved through the Nvidia Control Panel for some, otherwise I'd wait for a patch for that specific problem. The game is still perfectly playable for me, hence the positive review.

I'll keep it short. Horizon Zero Dawn absolutely captured me for an entire week. An entire week of just playing this, enjoying this, exploring this. I encountered no bugs, no crashes. I very much enjoyed it and I warmly and thoroughly recommend it to anyone looking for a great open world game with an enthralling story.

Horizon Zero Dawn


Is a game with a really rich story.
I really like the game cause the story is good, graphics are nice and the gameplay is great.
Soundtrack not that bad.
The Dlc is really cool with new things to kill and new weapons.
The game let's you chose what to answer to the other npcs and that's great.
I loved the feel of this open world game it was great.
The game is worth it but i don't know why they need so much data other than that nothing really.
Great game.

I love this game. I am currently 47 hrs into the game and it has been one of the most enjoyable games i have ever played. It looks amazing and is just overall extremely fun.

I know a lot of people are currently having performance issues and i seem to be one of the lucky few that can play the game, apart from the occasional crash (every couple of hrs) it runs smooth for me.

10/10

1000000000000/10 when the crashes are gone <3

Only on PlayStation?
WELL, NOT ANYMORE!!!

The PC port is actually better than what some reviews stated. I'm not saying it's great but it's better than what we expected and definitely better than Red Dead Redemption 2 port. There are still issues with the game but I am yet to experience one that heavily affects the gameplay. The game needs further optimization but it's still quite playable.

Hopefully this will be the first step to end exclusivity. To make that happen this needs to be a hit, a big one. So, people who can afford it, please buy the game so we can expect more PS4 titles on PC.

Have Fun!

I hate that I have to give this game a bad review. The gameplay on its own is stellar, but due to the fact that the game won't even run for more than 20 mins, I cannot recommend that anyone buy this right now.

Definitely do not recommend this until they make significant fixes.
I've had at least 7 crashes in my time playing, and most of them during cutscenes.
The FPS is extremely unstable, jumping down from 60 all the way to 30 on a 1060. (Digital Foundry mentioned the same)
If you're using Intel Hardware. wait for fixes before you pick up the game.

While you are waiting for the end of optimization you can deliver couple of cargoes playing DEATH STRANDING made on the same engine.
Epic game with some technical issues.

Unoptimized port. Not worth the purchase in my opinion. Too much jutter, bad frame pacing, artifacting, and overall mediocre performance. I'll revisit this title at another date.

It's really smooth at ultra 1080p. (Running it on a 2060 Super.)


P.S : Sony pls release more titles on PC.

I really wanted to play and enjoy this game. I have suffered crashes every 5 minutes stopping me from even progressing in this game. I am above recommended specs and have tried all potential fixes that can be found on forums or other websites. It's gotten to the point where if this game crashes I require a full system restart to be able to even play another game. If I can figure out whats going on and how to fix it I will be updating this review according to the actual game play.

Horizon Zero Dawn was the first game I played on the PS4. Now let’s be honest here it really
cannot get much cooler than hunting giant animal machines with bows and arrows.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a third-person action game set in a post-apocalyptic open world where machines have overrun the Earth. The remains of Humanity live in small tribes with primitive technology. The main protagonist, Aloy, must go on a quest to investigate the origins of the machines and find out what led to the previous civilization’s downfall.

Played on

CPU: Intel i7-5930K
GPU: 1080 8 GB
RAM: 24 GB RAM

Razer Blade 15
Processor: Intel Core i7-9750H 6 Core Processor
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060
Memory RAM: 16GB RAM

1. The visuals
This game looks fantastic. A high-end pc will probably make this game into a work of art,
Even tho I am running this game on high/ultra settings at 1080p, The environment looks fantastic, from the forests, rivers, and snowy mountains to deserts and ruined buildings of the old world.

2. Gameplay
A big part of what makes Horizon: Zero Dawn so enjoyable to me is its combat, specifically when fighting machines. You encounter quite a few human enemies in the game, but the human encounters are relatively a lot more straightforward.

3. Writing
Horizon: Zero Dawn’s narrative is one of my favorite video game stories. The idea of primitive humans living “among or in fight with” highly technologically advanced machines is fascinating, with the mysterious existence of “Old Ones,” who supposedly created this technology long before the time of Aloy and her people.

Verdict
10/10 Game.
Please release other Sony PS exclusive games on PC so we can play them on 4K Ultra Settings at 60FPS
“Insert PC Master Race GIF here.”

as a Gamer, I lean on the completionist side and after about 100 hours, I just finished the main campaign, founds most campfires and collectibles, completed side missions and met most NPCs.
I explored, I wondered, I hunted and gathered, not a care in the world and enjoyed every second of it.

I sometimes just launched the game to relax after a long day and enjoyed the scenery, running or trotting around.
Sometimes I just found an abandoned ancient civilisation city and imagined how life looked like back then, finding the roads and building and daydreaming about what we are doing today.

Finding the memos and notes is amazing, the writing is terrific and super immersive without falling into cliches.
I love what Gerrilla made with the side characters too, the writing isn't polarised 'good vs bad' everyone has a back story and motives, goals and mistakes.
The role-play and decision making is definitely just aesthetic and doesn't bring anything new to the table but still feels nice and adds a little extra touch in a few dialogues.
The combat system is rich and really allows you to bring you own style to the battle, from a Barbarian/blunt style to silent ninja with traps to whatever in between.

I which the variety of animals (organic, mainly) was richer but I guess it fits the narrative as it is.

All in all I am really looking forward to finish the extension and them start the Game+

If you, like me enjoy the narrative as much as beautiful graphics, you are in for a treat.
Hunting all the notes and memos will take some time though.

I see a lot of reviews mentioning bugs/ crashes, I had maybe 3 crashes in total. Hope it helps.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a great game.

+Graphics(it really looks great)
+Gameplay
+Story(really good)
+Open World(the map is really big and you have something to explore)
+RPG
+Music
+Pleasant atmosphere


Horizon Zero Dawn is a combination of Far Cry and
Assassin's Creed and offers a perfect balance, good story a great world to explore and good gameplay easy to learn.

10/10 Must Play I recommend buying it at a discount or at full price, it is worth every penny.

And I'm very glad that this wonderful game came on PC as well.

I waited till i have finished the game with all the quests, the DLC included before writing a review.
I think i first need to give the specs, for comparison :
- 32Gb Ram
- 2x 1080TI (one dedicated to games, one for the rest)
- i7-6700K 4Ghz
- 4K display
- Game on a SSD
- Win 10
- Latest drivers
- All settings to maximum

TlDR : A very mixed experience

1. Warning :
- I noticed that this game has a very strong anti-patriarchy tones in many dialogues. Even though Aloy was raised in a matriarchal society, she spouts a lot of lines that make me wonder how she was raised. Now, i don't really care about that. There are many ways to explain her behaviour and same for all the female characters' behaviour when they are talking. However, i do know that there are people that don't like being preached at in games and will want to avoid games with such content, so consider yourselves warned.

2. Performance :
- The performance of the game is rather nice. The game was running smoothly almost all the time. Had a few FPS drops here and there but nothing major or game breaking. From that side, it was surprisingly enjoyable.

3. Story :
- Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you are looking at it, the story isn't anything new. It's a typical post-apocalyptic story where the main character has to save the day. I've seen/read/played these a lot so for me it's nothing new. That being said, since it's something quite usual, the game tells its story quite well and as such it's quite enjoyable to play trough. There was one plot-twist that i didn't expect and i was rather pleased with it. So on this side i'm feeling satisfied with it.

4. Graphics :
- I must say that the game's graphics are nothing to spit at, they are beautiful. Some places have really breathtaking vistas and exploring the world is enjoyable as such.
- That being said, this is standard for PC. Many games have graphics as good if not even better, though not the same performance to attain such graphics. One of them being Witcher 3, and another being Warframe (for the sake of comparing with a game of different kind).

5. Bugs :
- Setting aside the minor bugs that do not impact the game much, there is only one big major bug that everyone is talking about and might deter people from buying the game : the crashing bug. Now, i did have crashes, but although it was rather infuriating, especially when the game crashed in the middle of a cut scene or some other important game moment, it wasn't as bad as some people say it is. by reading the forums, i discovered that the crash "timer" can be reset by rebooting the PC, which i tried and it seems to work. Now, why do i consider this as not that bad? Well that is because i tried to play the game in sessions as long as possible and usually the game would crash after 10+ hours of play for me. So if you play in sessions of 2-4 hours, you might not even see a single crash. Also, it might be the game's way of telling you to take a break.

Now, for the obligatory comparison :
- I played the Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, and the Witcher series, so my opinion of this game was heavily influenced by it's predecessors.
- This game feels like an Assassin's Creed game mixed with The Witcher in a world similar to Mass Effect.
- The graphics are similar to The Witcher
- The exploration and platforming remind me of Assassin's Creed
- This game seems to have the main theme as a world destroyed by a race's greed (similar to Mass Effect's story).

All in all, this game is not bad. If there were no crashes it would be more enjoyable, but it already is a lot.
I am recommending this game because the game contains the DLC for free and this gives enough value to the game for the price they are asking.

If you are concerned about the performance and the crashes, you might want to wait for the game to be on sale before buying, but after 70 hours i feel that i got my money's worth out of this game.

This was a very narrow un-recommend, but ultimately I decided that the things I liked about this game were directly overshadowed by its failings.

It's beautiful, but empty. Aloy is extremely well modeled, animated, etc, but 95% of her interactions will be with dead-eyed puppet people with poor voice acting, which the quality of her "performance" only highlights.

The game systems in general feel like a mashup of AAA open world games from 2012-2015, and yet amazingly manage to be a step backwards in a lot of ways, despite coming out in 2017. Like I swear if these machines could talk, they would say "Must have been my imagination" and "just the wind" when I pick one of them off and then hide in the tall grass for 5 seconds. I must add that the tall grass is a very binary stealth system. You're invisible if you crouch in it, and outside of it you get spotted from 100m away all the time.

The robot AI is very predictable and so prone to getting confused by the terrain that I found myself exploiting it when I didn't even mean to.

All in all, I felt like this was a game that presented itself as being more than it was, both with its directorial choices, and especially with how tightly crafted the first 3-4 hours were, before it fell off a cliff and became an empty world full of non-characters, peppered only with collectables to justify itself.

This game is a masterpiece. I absolutely loved it on the PS4. With A LOT of adjustments I managed to make it work without shutter on PC as well. As of patch 1.08 the game runs fairly sable although the performance is still a long way from being decent. However, It's certainly in a much better state than at launch. Hope they'll continue to work on it.

I waited so long for it to come out on PC, I insta-bought it as soon as it came out and I loved every minute of it.
100%: 75h. Difficulty: 😈. Ultra Hard difficulty is not that difficult, especially in NG+.

played the game on PS4 but excited to play it again on PC... game looks beautiful on PC
but shame with 3 years after the PS4 version it's not optimized the game needs to be fixed asap
any game that stutters on PC is a turn off.. also low FPS on a high end GPU is not good... weird too cz the game uses the same engine as Death Stranding which is a great port

Thumbs up for the Game itself
big Thumb down for the Port so Far

Is this just Far Cry: Primal with robots?
Honestly, a little bit — being very reductive. I think a rather concise, yet salient description would be something like — “Far Cry: Primal mixed with elements of Assassin's Creed and Witcher having significant Mass Effect overtones with some Generation Zero sprinkled in.” As in, Aloy, the protagonist is rather young and as such the narrative is explained or perhaps experienced through the lens of a young adult. Feels a lot like the books “Divergent”, “Maze Runner” or “Park Service”.

Combat preparation.
A significant portion of the game is spent gathering resources and traveling. Capacity upgrades are obtained through hunting animals for bones and skin, similar to Far Cry.
Universal Constants — The game attempts to suggest that all the robots have strengths and weaknesses of some variety. However, there are a few things that are true for most if not all robots. Tear damage removes components more easily. And generally speaking, everything is weak to either fire, ice or shock damage. Typically stunning, knocking over or revealing a power core to be shot for more damage. Other weapons beyond bows generally involve trapping or impediment of movement — area of effect damage from weapons like slings. You're also able to craft any supplies on the fly akin to Lara Croft in the rebooted series provided you've got the resources. Weapons mods can alter damage types.

Fast Travel and Merchants — The game actively dissuades the use of fast travel by having it cost “fast travel packs”; these are relatively expensive, costing not just shards but meat and other supplies. I actually LOVE this... narratively. It makes sense that merchants would not only take shards but take other goods as well. It's not like they could just stop at McDonalds coming home from work. But in practice it can make the game feel rather slow in the beginning. 

Mounts leave much to desired — You have to override them in order to use them. More are unlocked through Cauldrons. But this is not that useful outside of combat as other robots will still chase you. It's much more prudent to stealth around and take your time to get to destinations. Not to mention healing the mount costs metal shards but doesn't increase a bond or anything.

Maker's Breath...
Aloy is appointed Seeker of the Chantry, herald of Andraste no... she's appointed an N7 Spectre for the Alliance Navy noo... She's IS appointed Seeker, but for her own Nora tribe. After being exiled for venturing into the forbidden metal lands. This is after proceeding to prevail at the Proving to become a Brave. That's just the intro to the game.

Look, everything is derivative. What makes a story “take hold” of you is how it's able to relate to the player/viewer/reader. What I think Horizon: Zero Dawn does wrong is that it doesn't trick you that well. A really good story will will make you forget that it's derivative. It'll obfuscate its influences and alter them. And in the case of homages there are usually nods to these influences, but I don't see many here. It purports to be unique despite its overt theme. There is mild uniqueness but it takes some time to uncover.


Is this the “Outpost Takedown/Tower Climb” Ubisoft formula?
Personally, I believe Ubisoft perfected the “map is a checklist” formula. However, I'd make the contention that the map is too convoluted to actually use beyond setting way points or selecting a fast travel point in Horizon. But the sentiment remains. You'll take down outposts, hunt certain robots, climb towers Tallnecks.

Climbing these reveals more locations of on the map. And it certainly feels like a Ubisoft game, the climbing even feels like an Assassin's Creed game.

That said, something clicked for me during one of the missions. Before this point I had viewed the game as slightly obtuse, mildly tedious — bordering on annoying — but when I found myself tying down a Corrupter with a ropecaster, using fire arrows to overheat and subsequently reveal its power core to then use slow down to nail it with a hardpoint precision arrow — I said to myself... there might be something to this...

Some regular fights can be quite epic feeling.

This was coupled with the fact that more of the story was being revealed as to why these specific robots were even there in the first place.

The game is very pretty but I feel that it doesn't ultimately serve the narrative.
The robots actually feel like they fit into the world. It seems, at least to me, there was supposed to be this very extreme juxtaposition between the humans against the mechanical giants that roam the land. But the robots actually behave like animals so they don't, in essence, seem out of place. There's no real reason to explore. Just more common resources or a collectible. It felt like a big place I needlessly spent a lot of time running around in just to get to the next objective. Much of the world feels like filler.

This is anecdotal, but the game feels a lot like We Happy Few outside of cities at nighttime. Moreover, “Sir, you are being hunted”.

The Gist:
It's a pretty generic triple A game, in all honesty. What else can you expect? But it's a pretty good one. And it's got a lot of stuff to do. Especially if you enjoy killing big monsters or taking down outposts in a big open space. I ended up really liking it in the end. This version includes all the DLC as well.

If you've read this far, consider following my curation — Station Argus

Spoiler Zone!!!
Let me further explain this Mass Effect connection that I propose:
Hover over the square.







Now, these things aren't inherently unique to Horizon or Mass Effect but when in relation with all the other aspects I mentioned, I believe the comparison is just.

Regardless of how easy or prevalent it is, these remain effective as story-telling devices. Kind of like amnesia being used as much as it is as a plot device to relay information to the player.

--

Now give me Killzone on PC, Guerrilla. Also let Insomniac bring more stuff to PC like Ratchet & Clank, Sony. Stop being silly. Resistance: Fall of Man

Honestly, I'm happy that Playstation has decided to release some of their exclusive only games, Days Gone, Predator, and Horizon Zero Dawn.

Horizon Zero Dawn has a pretty unique atmosphere, taking place after a catastrophic event that left the human race brace on extinction in the 31st century United States. You start out as an outcast Aloy and the main goal in the story is to uncover her past. Oh, and machines have basically taken over the world too. The rest is up to you since you should give this game a try!

The combat is good. Bow & arrow there are different types of bows (fast and less powerful or slow and strong damage), you can use shock, fire, ice traps to surprise your enemy and you can use the stealth mechanics (bushes, high-ground, etc..) to your advantage. Elemental slingshots, and also a spear for close combat.

There are plenty of side quests, trials, and collectibles to keep you busy if you are looking else instead of the main story which is at least 20-30 hours. There are also bandit camps and cauldrons that you can explore too.

The skill tree is pretty average compared to other RPG games. Divided into 3 sections. First focuses on stealth. The second focuses on combat and improving weapon damage. The third helps Aloy's health, passive skills, and resource management.

Pretty big map, there are different areas on the map ranging from, forests, deserts, mountains, ice regions. All beautiful regions where I barely fast traveled because I was too busy taking it all in.

The good thing about this is it comes with all DLC for an honestly good price where I would pay full.

This is a wonderful game! 100 hours for 95% completion in ultra hard difficulty felt like 10.

The main thing in an epic combat system, where you need to learn each enemy and master your opportunities to exploit its weaknesses and avoid strengths.

It may sound kinda generic, but here it is a rare case when shooting the weak spot is actual and physical, and teared out components will disable something from the opponents.

It is like the actual Witcher should fight =)

The only cons to it is that is painfully, obviously observable, that many complicated mechanics and ideas were simplified or cut out, to make the game more accessible for halfwits casual console peasants.

Alas, alas. If it would be a true PC game, mods could solve it. Maybe, some day.

Anyways, the port is solid, the plot is nice and gameplay is awesome.

8.5/10 with extra bonus for graphics upgrade for the ultimate PC power capabilities.

Absolutely mesmerizing, one of the best games I had the pleasure of playing in a long while, if ever. Aloy's story will grab you by the guts and never let go. The worldbuilding is amazing, the OST gorgeous, but really it's the gameplay that makes this game. You can't hack and slash your way through or you'll die pretty quickly: HZD forces you to think, to strategize and use the environment as best as you can, to read up on the machines' weaknesses and exploit them. It's brilliant. Probably one of the only games I'll ever play in Ultra Hard mode because of this. Several technical difficulties here and there but nothing that made the game unplayable for me, and Guerilla is constantly patching so far. Can't wait for the sequel.

The way the game started was superbly done! The world looks gorgeous and the gameplay so far is smooth and looks like lots of fun, stealth elements are nice and easy to master, weapons are classic ones but reworked to make them look different as per similar RPG games i have played. Overall this game is a great prospect really. The way an RPG is meant to be done.

Only downside is the port is messy so far, runs very badly and some stutters here and there, even on low settings it fails to maintain 60fps on 1080p, they need to give us an update soon! Quite disappointed tbh with the port as it runs on Decima Engine (Death Stranding's port was perfectly done), the ordinary optimization kinda ruins Aloy's adventure for me :(

Coming to the game itself, after playing for about 3 hours i would say it's a masterpiece! Kudos to Guerrilla and thanks to Sony for giving this game to the beloved PC community, one of my long awaited games. 10/10 Shards from me.

This game is absolutely stunning, it is not often that I invest the time to 100% complete a game, but Horizon is one of the few games that was so good, I deemed it worthy for a spot on my 100% list. There isnt really anyting negative I can say, the story was an absolute blast, the music and sounds are all on point and the gameplay is fun. I did encounter 1-2 small bugs, but nothing worth mentioning.

Overall, I highly recommend this game, the price may be a bit high for an older title, but if its on sale I would consider it a must have/buy.

How do i feel playing 3 year old game, cost about 24AUD for ps4, with frame drops?

Absolute rubbish, there is nothing special after 3 years old 74.99AUD game, PC players got scammed hard.
They had 3 years to get it right.

Game runs beautifully at ultra settings on my MSI GT73VR 7RE Titan with i7 and GTX 1070. Only a few hours in but no crashes or bugs that I've encountered.

Will write a proper review later, but wanted to let any wondering if the port was good...it is.

9/4/20 Edit:
The game is now running stable on highest settings so I'm adjusting my review to positive. It's a wonderful game and I'm glad it received the attention to get it right!

8/11/20 Edit:
I was able to make the game stable by running in Original graphics with FPS changed from Unlimited to 60, in fullscreen only. Still leaving the negative review up until a patch is made so we can appreciate the higher FPS.

The game is crashing all the time. It crashes in the middle of missions, at the end of long cutscenes, a bunch. Wait to buy until this has been fixed.

I preloaded this to go through a 2 hour unpacking on launch anyway, and now that I did the game won't even launch and crashes while "optimizing performance to hardware" (who tf does that in PC gaming). A process that also takes like half an hour and simply goes CTD for me. People who by some miracle did launch this are reporting performance issues left and right. Nobody tested this thing. They had years and no one gave a crap. Absolute disregard for the customers. Avoid at all costs.

Ok where do I even begin.

First, my specs are:
GTX 1660 Super
Ryzen 5 2600
1TB NVME (game installed in this drive)
MSI B450 Gaming Plus MB
16 GB @ 3200mhz memory
Nvidia Driver 451.67 (game ready driver for HZD)
No RGB

If you don't want to read the entire review then I'll summarize it
Don't believe in the advertised min/recommended specs, it's false advertising. You need a NASA PC to run this game.

Not satisfied?? Then continue to read below.

Now onto the game. The first time you launch the game, it game does some "processing" and tells you that it's "optimizing the game based on your hardware" or something around those lines. It took around 15-20 minutes on mine. I find this shady as ♥♥♥♥ as it just stole 20 minutes of my precious 2-hour period before I can ask for a refund just in case.

Now onto the performance before you PC Master Race get ahead of yourselves. I immediately benchmark the game at the lowest possible graphics settings at 720p. Guess what, it couldn't even hold at 60 frames. It was jumping from 50s to 40s.
There are a couple of problems here. My specs are obviously above minimum and let's just say juuuuust slightly above the recommended. What EXACTLY IS "recommended" to you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? To be able to run 30fps frames at lowest settings???
I know my spec's limitation so I expected it be able to run it at least a 60 frames, medium settings at 720p?? Are you saying that your advertised recommended specs cannot hold 60 frames ?? That's BS!. It doesn't matter if it's benchmark or actual gameplay, I got ♥♥♥♥ frames regardless. And pleeeeaaase, don't give me BS that it will get patch blah blah blah.

These MFkrs are so proud of their trailers about "unlimited fps, blah blah blah". Let me tell you, the settings in the game don't do MFking ♥♥♥♥. unlimited fps?? Pfffft, you're funny man.

Minimum requirements should have you be able to run the game at 30fps at lowest settings stable and recommended requirements should have you be able run the game at medium to high settings at 720p 60 frames stable.

This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FRAUD AND A SCAM.

The game feels outdated and the textures are barely acceptable.

I like the placement of Aloy as a main character who is formed from a tribal group that rejects her, making her a strong individual for her journey. Going down the rabbit hole, digging and fighting for the truth, a secret, mystery of the story. A great ride.
For the concept i hecking love it, everything is beautiful especially the machines, robots, animal robots, yea ANIMALS! (some of them are gigantic)

Simply a great game! Somehow made me feel like playing The Witcher 3 for the first time, which is a very good thing for sure :D

BTW people cry about crashes, bugs, etc but if you have a stable system and the latest drivers installed, you'll be alright. CPU, GPU and memory are all heavily overclocked on my system but I haven't had a crash playing this game so far, cause I actually wasted a few hours to fine-tune my system with correct voltages and timings. You can't just pray to All-Mother and expect all your tech problems to be magically gone.

Edit: Guerilla have been ignoring the texture problem with 4GB VRAM AMD cards for months, so I'll just change my review to negative and go pray to All-Mother.

Edit 2: Texture bug got fixed with 1.10 patch (6 months after the initial release), but I ain't removing my negative review. Sorry but not sorry Guerilla.

The game is amazing and has every potential to be the best of the year.
It's the first day of launch so frequent crashes might be common.
Really love that fact that they brought it to PC!
Lots of love and I hope you fix it soon my lovely Devs!
Chill my fellow people , they will surely fix it :D <3\

The game doesn't crash anymore :D
So happy!
