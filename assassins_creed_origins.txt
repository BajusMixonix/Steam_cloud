After several days of heavy playing and finally finishing the whole story, I'm bringing myself back here to write my very first game review. I started playing the AC series from AC2 which is an epic game. Besides the rises and falls of public opinion toward this brand name, I've always liked the past AC games (yes, even the Unity which everybody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on). Game makers are trying very hard to continue the story, and I truly appreciate their efforts.

Some of the best things about ACO that I really like:

1. Architecture. This is the best thing about AC games. For me, it's since I first "ran" across Venice Rooftops. I could just sit at the top of the Pyramid of Giza and stare at this fabulous world all day long.

2. Combat. Alright, I have complex feelings about this one. Combat is really hard compared to previous AC games, where you could basically just do counters and take down as many guards as there possibly are. Being surrounded would be a nightmare in ACO when you're not well-equipped enough. Luckily boss battles are not hell because you mostly only need to deal with one, and then you can truly analyze their attacking patterns and fight accordingly. BTW, I started using long-ranged predator bows to assassinate most of the normal guards. Super fun controlling the arrow in air and headshotting around the corner, and helps you avoid so much conflict.

3. Resource gathering. I think this is where the game makers really gave some thoughts. You never have excess money or resources, but you never lack a whole lot of them either. You won't have to spend a lot of time to gather some key resources for one or two important upgrade that might get you through one major quest. Super equipments are not hard to get either, Reda the You Also Grow Too Fast kid sells this chest in which legendary ranked stuff are not scarce. All these make the balance just about right between going through the main story and doing random training and gathering to leveling up.

4. Photo mode. Haha this one is just SUPER! This could keep some people playing for a long while. Now those beautiful sceneries would never be wasted again. And you have a bunch of options to play with to make your favorite photo. Also, you can see other amazing photos taken by other players as well in the map tab. Also, those photos might contain information about the location as well, sometimes useful.

5. Senu. She is the Origin of the Eagle Vision and she is the BEST so far. This system helps you locate objects, treasures, animals, enermies and even entrances, but you do have to manually scan the map to pin them all. Again, I think it's just about right in terms of balance.


That being said, some other not too positive thougts too.
6. Level system. This kind of started since Syndicate where the ability points system is introduced. But... you have to upgrade hidden blade damage, or otherwise you can't even do half hp damage to a high level captain or commander when "assassinating" from behind? That just feels weird. Thankfully leveling up and collecting material to upgrade, say your hidden blade (at least to a "usable" degree for your current mission) would not be too much of a hassle, otherwise this system would be really annoying.

7. Story.
7.1 I really liked Bayek's story, but I don't see why... alright I'm not turning myself into a spoiler. Anyways, I see others complaining that every AC game gives a new definition of the Creed, but I kinda disagree with that. Nobody said that game makers advocated what they where conveying through the characters. We see that in AC3 where the game itself spoke for Haythem's Templar logic and criticized Conner's brute work to some extent. The debate between ideologies never stopped, and as a game series, I think AC is still handling itself okay in this context. I believe that if you have played AC3 before, you would probably feel as I do that Bayek is not much better than Conner when Conner started his journey. But the idea Bayek and Aya put forward toward the end of ACO did make sense and was a good explanation for the Origin of the brotherhood. But besides from that, I still find the story lacking the impact I had when playing AC2, Revelations, Black Flag or Rogue.
7.2 In addition, the modern timeline didn't progress much either... I'm really not interested in picking up all the novels and stuff, and I know none of the characters in ACO except for William Miles (whom I only know as much as that he is Desmond's father). I'll just wait for the next AC game and see if the modern timeline could make any sense. I hope it does. Well, you could actually find clues in ACO but... Again, I'm not gonna be a spoiler.

8. Music. It's nowhere near bad. Actually I think it's good and immersive. But Venice Rooftops and Ezio's Family just couldn't be beaten.

To the end of this pile of rubbish I just talked, I like this game very much. But I guess that nobody actually cares, lol. Those who are not interested will probably still not buy this game after reading all those positive reviews, and those who are interested already bought and shot the sh*t out of Anubis haha. Good luck hunting hippos everybody!

Overall Score: 8.2 / 10

Quality	7.3/10	　　　　High quality AAA beta
Performance	8/10	Good optimization, only a few minor
frame drops in highly populated areas
and the FMVs with maximized settings
Utility	6/10	A big variety of lil' bugs & glitches, but
no game-breaking bugs experienced;
a lot of bugs have been fixed and the
first patches introduced new features;
requires 3rd party account → Uplay
Controls	8/10	Good controls with pad, but somewhat
clunky melee combat and bad auto-aim
(locked to the chest); smooth mounted
combat, bird/drone flights and climbing;
kb+m controls are decent overall aswell
Gameplay	8.8/10	　　　　An AC "Solo-MMORPG"
Challenge	9/10	Designated level range for the zones,
4 difficulties (swap 'em freely) and the
option to upscale enemies' level: have
it your way! Mini-game leaderboards
Content	10/10	~40 hours, if you rush the main quest,
but easily 100h to 100% in a relaxed
playstyle; lots of endcontent: optional
quests, challenges, events and DLC
Diversity	7/10	Lots of different landscapes and cities,
engaging side quests & a wide range
of weapons to choose from; boring AI,
repetitive dungeons and enemy design
Immersion	9/10	Mind-blowing graphics & map size that
make it really easy to lose yourself in
this massive, virtual, ancient Egypt (!);
almost no gore, no dismemberments
Design	8.4/10	　 　 Good work that lacks finesse
Visuals	10/10	Stunning graphical quality and design
overall; already looks better in 1080p
than most recent releases look in 4k;
even impressive sights on Very Low
Sound	8/10	Good, localized voice-overs (Latin and
Egyptian for plot-irrelevant NPC); SFX
OK; stereotypical, but coherent OST
Texts	7/10	Significant historical content; timeless
motive of revenge, but the plot seems
tacked together; no interaction at all:
no dialogue options or moral decisions
Mapping	9/10	A vast, very naturalistic world, just like
Wildlands. Lots of similar structures,
but that is authentic; small dungeons
Interface	8/10	Mostly well designed UI and menus;
almost completely customizable HUD


🎵 * This bug was the worst, yet my personal favorite!

📷　Includes a photo tool for shots from any angle.

💸　Worth the full price, but ~40€ as key or on sale.

Performance issues:

If you just bought the game recently at the time i'm writing this and you have performance issues on Nvdia cards, Know that it is an issue with the latest gpu driver (451.67). Download the older one from Nvidia's Website (446.14) and it will be solved. Unusual problem that can really ruin your experience specially if you just bought it so here is the fix.

This game has separate place in my heart because to buy this game i asked money from my Grandmother some months ago. Now my grandmother passed away last month. The graphics and gameplay is just amazing. I can't express in words but the game is really really amazing. Hats off to team Ubisoft to making this wonderful game. I could relate alot with Bayek. And i completed the whole game and that satisfaction was at next level. I will never forget this game because my grandma gave money to buy this game. This game will always be in my heart and this game will remind me all those wonderful days when i used to spend with my grandma. Really i am missing her alot. This game will remain as her last gift which she given to me. And hats off to whole ubisoft team for making this wonderful game.

Finally, Ubisoft realized that it was ancientry that conceals the very «Assassin» entourage of the first parts.

The tense political situation, unusual cultural flavor and aspects of Egyptian life literally saturated with mysterious religiosity made Origins one of the best events in the series from the time of first parts....
However, Origins is an amazing encyclopedia of culture in itself. And whoever says anything about Assassin's Creed, anyone will agree that only Ubisoft is engaged in such a thorough visualization of the era. And this time, the developers have outdone themselves.

It is impossible to express in a couple of paragraphs the delight that you experience when you rush through the bare desert on a camel, pass the villages teeming with life, visit the temples of Osiris and Set. When you get to Alexandria, and there you can go to the still unburnt library with thousands of manuscripts... Each region, each settlement, be it Memphis or Siwa, has its own artistic flavor, the diversity of which is amazing.

The developers have endowed the Egyptians with many patterns of situational behavior. You enter the morgue, and the embalming bodies of the hard workers tell you about all the details of this procedure. In temples, people pray - in each in its own way, because the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans have gathered here. The guard, seeing the body of a colleague, will pick up the body and carry it somewhere. Random events are happening everywhere.

The game card is huge, but more importantly, it really feels like that. Constantly switching between Bayek and Seine and learning that there are people going about their business kilometers away from us, we find ourselves in the context of a really functioning, whole world. And it fully corresponds to our naive ideas about Ancient Egypt.
Each «tower» offers stunning views, the territory of which seems limitless. But the most attractive thing about this is the horizon. After all, there are new cities, new landscapes and, most importantly, new adventures. This is exactly what we lacked in the last parts of Assassin's Creed.

My overall thoughts
Assassin’s Creed Origins is an attempt to bring in new ideas by taking cues from the recent RPGs while trying to retain the soul of the series. To that attempt, I say it has succeeded. The vast expanse of Egypt is breathtaking. The new style of combat is amazing and the narrative has you dig deep into the origins of the Creed, the handbook of the world’s most spiritual killers. I’ve been always been an Assassin’s creed apologist and even when playing unity and syndicate, I found many redeemable qualities.

However, the franchise’s lethargy soon rubbed off on me I was finally going to give up. I mean come on, I liked Unity but Syndicate came off nothing more than an attempt to rectify Unity’s mistake. It made me want to assassinate the franchise. But that all changed with AC Origins, a game that I couldn’t stop playing and finally made me fall in love with the Franchise again.

Plot

You follow Bayek of Siwa, an Egyptian badass and the last Medjay of Egypt. He is on the quest to avenge the death (I know) of his young son by the hands of “masked ones” – an order of proto templars who you chase around all through Egypt. Along the way, you will meet characters such as the brotherly Phanos, the cowardly Ptolemy, the seductress Cleopatra and the conniving Julius Ceasar. The story is weaved in long and drawn-out quests whose pay off makes it almost worth it.

As you can guess, I like the story. While it’s the same my-family-got-murdered-and-I-gotta-murder-the-murderer-too feel of the old games, I like the fact that here, the main character is a father. You see several layers of Bayek. He comes off as kind and playful to help-seekers and rage-filled god of death to the killers. The storytelling is fairly linear but that grips you from start to finish, with you hoping that in the end, Bayek finds some happiness.

Presentation
The vast expanse of Egypt is breath-taking. From the populated cities to depilated caves, from the mysterious pyramids to the historic Alexandria, every inch of recreated Egypt oozes care and detail. It’s further complemented by the game excellent lighting system, where you can feel the dizzying warmth of the sun as you run or cart over the land of this new playground. The water physics were the best of 2017 and 18, and even 20.

Gameplay

Combat

Combat has been completely overhauled in this game. The counter kill manoeuvres of the previous titles has been replaced by a hitbox mechanic. The combat is complemented by different classes of weapons including Staves, spears, regular sword, khopesh, dual daggers, maces and heavy swords. Each weapon has a unique weight behind it and provides a different way of playstyle.

Another major change in combat is the addition of ranged combat. You now have a bow and not just of a single kind. There is a multi-arrow-spitting warrior bow, a precise-hitting hunter bow, a scope-wielding predator bow and a fast and magnificent light bow. While predator and hunter bows are helpful in stealth, warrior and light bows scream style in combat sections.
The game allows you to equip to melee and two range weapons. Strategize, choose and switch them as per your playstyle anytime as you face challenges from enemies, both man and beasts.

Stealth

Continuing the “innovation” of a dedicated crouch button in Unity, AC origins gives you the ability to crouch behind your enemy as you stab him with your pre-assassin hidden blade. The addition of many ranged weapon options has you meticulously pick off your enemies from a distance. Stealth is satisfying – giving you a rising feeling as you clear out a camp of Roman soldiers without even a single soul screaming.

Exploration

Egypt is vast, and I mean ridiculously vast. You can travel across horseback, camelback or chariot on the road for a faster traversal. On the river, you have boats. The series’ staple parkour mechanics are back. However, they don’t give the same feeling as in the previous games. One can say the parkour has been put on the back burner to make room new ways to explore the desert wonder. And boy there is a lot to explore. There are caves, bandit camps, underwater treasure bellies and more.

None of the exploration options is without rewards. Other than being a completionist’s wet dream of checklist gaming, it also provides you with ample of side quests. There are over 100 side quests and all of them have something to add to either the character or the narrative of the game.

RPG elements

In the series’ first, traditional RPG elements are weaved into the game with three classes of abilities to develop: Warrior, Hunter and seeker. As you complete quests and explore the world, you gain experience points that you can to put in either one or all of those classes. The quality of abilities you get range from effective to mediocre to obtuse. Although the addition is appreciated, you can see that this is just Ubi’s attempt to see how the new elements work out.

Online Elements

AC Origins is one of the victims of mobile-gaming models that have slithered their ways in Single Player Games. There are events and daily missions, giving you a chance to take a bite of that legendary loot you've been eyeing for so long. Daily missions give you two types of quests: fetch and assassinations. However, the events contain climatic and challenging boss battles that are rewarding quite on their own. 

However, the rate of loot drops is painfully low, forcing a grind that while enjoyable, is still a grind. And it doesn't help that the in-your-face microtransaction model that Ubi has been peddling to compensate for the rarity of loot drops is quite pathetic. That being said, it won't affect your gameplay experience, and you, like me can get quite a lot of loot without spending one penny. Just be ready to invest a lot of time in the desert. 

How well it plays?

The game is demanding. While I wasn’t expecting for a potato to run it, I was hoping for some levity for mid-level machines. While desert regions can help you maintain constant 60, prepare to drop 10 29 in populated cities.

Is it worth it?

Assassin’s Creed Origins is borne out of the passion of its developers. The narrative main quests, the engaging side quests, the amazing gameplay can entertain you for hours. However, make sure that your machine has enough juice to experience it all. You can get lost in its details and even after 150 hours of gameplay, I’ve yet to see everything the game has to offer. However, the microtransactions don’t bode well for the direction the series is taking.

On that note, I give this game an 8 out of 10.

Assassin's Creed Origins symbolizes the change on the AC series.

I've been playing all the AC games in order for the past year, and while the series has had its ups and downs, it always stands up again. Origins may be more RPG than AC game, but that same feeling and the good ol' hidden blade make it a really good AC game, and it has a beautiful Egypt map with tons of areas to explore.

Great game, historically accurate and a nice new kind of Assassin's Creed.

I have followed the Assassins Creed series religiously since the days of Altaïr. Like everyone else, I have experienced a rollercoaster of feelings during the ongoing releases of the AC series; I adored the original game as well as AC2 and ACB, I enjoyed revelations, I lost all hope during AC3, re-gained hope during Black Flag and every game until now left me with no hope and a lot of hate.

Origins has re-ignited my love for the AC series: this game could not possibly deliver anything more 'Assassins Creedy'.
The story is brilliant and draws you in, the characters are so three dimensional and even though almost all controls have changed- the parkour, exploration and system of fighting still feels just like the 'good old days' (AC, AC2, ACB).
The game is stunning, I am yet to play a game with a better appearance and feel. The sound is incredible, the music is beautiful with hints of the previous games soundtracks entwined within; the sound effects within the game are so detailed, nothing has not been thought through.
The game itself is massive and there are an endless amount of things to do: stories to experience, enemies to conquer, lands to explore. I love the levelling up system, I love the weapons and upgrades- everything that is new or unlike the traditional AC games has been incorporated in a seamless way.

I understand everyone’s fear of buying and playing any new AC games due to their previous failures- but this is a game that is not worth missing. This is the game that brings everything back home.

125 hours is the time it took me to do everything there is to do in the game and its DLCs. I'm talking about exploring the entire map and completing every landmark, crafting every upgrade, unlocking every skill and getting some of them passive bonuses, acquiring every cosmetic item the shops offer, finishing the story, every sidequest and getting all the achievements. I even went through every tour instance and listened to them. Did I enjoy wasting 5 days of my life on a single videogame? Every single second.

I am not saying you need to spend 125 hours on this. I must admit, a part of me enjoyed this game simply because of its Egyptian theme. I spent a lot of time exploring the land and just looking at the breathtaking surroundings this game offers. This, The Witcher 3 and recently Assassin's Creed Valhalla are the only games where I was able to just... walk around the world.

Now let's look at the price. 60€ for a game like this sounds like a lot. I myself bought it on a sale, because I was unsure if I would enjoy it that much. Now that I know what the game offers, I would not mind paying the full price. If you do not like looking at the game as a work of art and would rather just do quests and get that fat loot, then you're missing out on a good chunk of content, and this game would simply be boring or not worth its price.

So full disclosure- I never really got into the AC games. I've only played some of the first and second games and decided they weren't really for me. I've avoided every AC game since then.

The main reason I bought this game was because I was itching for another an open-world game after finishing The Witcher 3, which blew me away. While the missions and story here dont have the same branching out like W3 does, this is still a fantastic game.

Starting off with the protagonist- Bayek is awesome. He's strong, loyal, kind, agile and fierce. He's well written and the voice actor did an excellent job. If Ubi made another AC game with Bayek I'd probably buy it. Many of the supporting cast is fantastic as well. The main story is great and The Hidden Ones expansion tops it off perfectly in my opinion. The Curse of the Pharaohs was a lot of fun as well. I did them in that order.

I really like how much there is to explore and find in this game. I felt compelled to discover every fast travel location, completed every enemy camp and animal lair, found every treasure, completed all the side quests and of course all the main missions. I did everything. It was just fun to see what was out there in the world, get XP and level up to get better weapons and gear and make Bayek an ultimate badass and meet new and interesting NPCs.

I love how if you find a weapon you really like you can take it to a blacksmith and upgrade it to your level to increase its damage. I must have carried the same weapon for at least 50 hours and i probably leveled it up a million times to max level 55. Thats a really cool option I think.

And thankfully, at least for me- there isnt a "Vision" mode here like tons of other games, (where you hit a button and it shows/tags items, enemies, points of interest (poi) etc but the graphics go to ♥♥♥♥). Instead in this game you hit a button and it puts little colored diamonds above loot, poi, etc without disrupting the graphics. And what I thought was an awesome addition was your eagle named Seru. He's always flying above you and you can instantly switch to him to hover around enemy camps to tag enemies, check terrain layouts, discover underground entrances, hidden treasures, and even harass enemies if you want! And the camera always zooms out to him and then zooms back to you without any fade outs or loading, very cool!

The only things I wish were different are the armor, level caps and horses. All weapons in the game have better/worse stats depending on what level they are of course, but armor is purely cosmetic. I get why Ubi did this so that people find a look they like and stick with it (or find something cooler), but I wish there were defense stats on them. And i wish you could do the same thing like with the weapons and upgrade them as you please. Being able to increase health, melee/ranged/tool damage but not defense seems a little baffling, but maybe its a balancing issue or something. Horses too dont have stats like at least how fast they can run, which was a little disappointing but not a huge deal.

Moving on the level caps...the main game caps at level 40, and I hit that just exploring the world discovering locations and doing mostly everything except the main story. With The Hidden Ones expansion your level cap increases to 45, and the Pharaohs expansions tops it out at 55. Even if you max out you still earn Ability Points for every level though, which can be applied to anything in the skill tree, and if you have all those learned already you can add 1% extra damage for either melee, ranged, or tool damage to no end. I just wish there were a higher level cap than 55 with better weapons available. To put some of this in perspective- during my 90 hours with the game+expansions, I hit level 55 with an extra 31 ability points distributed to the previously mentioned melee/ranged/tool categories. I did not learn about 5 or 6 abilities though because i wasnt particularly interested in those. This game could easily increase the cap to 75 or even higher for nuts like me. And theres New Game+ as well which im not going to do but if its there i would think the level cap would go even higher but I understand there has to be a ceiling somewhere.

Overall though I loved just about every aspect of this game. Areas didnt feel crowded and there always seemed to be a way through instead of having to go all around or up a cliff just to get to where you need to go. Mission markers were clear, NPC's didnt get it the way and they dont die during escort missions either which is great. Theres just a ton of stuff the game does right and well.

AC Odyssey is much the same although with a different protagonist (that ive read isnt nowhere near as great as Bayek though) and a somewhat bloated map, but I'll still check it out because you can Spartan kick enemies off ledges which seems comically fun at the very least.

I bought the main game first on sale and held off on the expansions until I felt that I liked the game enough and wanted more of it. All in all, I think I paid like $4 more buying everything separately instead of getting the Gold edition from the start on sale. But overall I enjoyed just about every minute of it. Highly recommended!!!!

This is a diorama of an entire culture. I can't say enough good about it. To walk the streets of Alexandria, Thebes, and see Karnak with its ceiling. The detail is astonishing.

What a journey!! Ubisoft did amazing and fantastic work on this one. I have always loved how they manage to create every detail so perfectly in these AC games. In Origins these details, colours and the places are absolutely stunning! from time to time I just stopped for awhile and enjoyed the sceneries.
This game made my thoughts go back in time when I visited in Luxor 1992. Egypt and it's history has always facinated me over these years.
So what can I say, this game is nearly perfect in every way, at least I did not experience any problems whatsoever.

Highly recommended and a must buy!!

OVERVIEW ↴
Assassin's Creed Origins is an amazing action-adventure stealth game experience for a single player set in Ancient Egypt near the end of the Ptolemaic period (49–44 BC), and recounts the secret but fictional history of once a proud kingdom, now a divided region. We take on a role of a Medjay named Bayek of Siwa, who works to protect the people of the Ptolemaic Kingdom during a time of widespread upheaval between Ptolemy XIII, Cleopatra and Julius Caesar fighting for control... and explore the origins of the centuries long conflict between the Hidden Ones (the Brotherhood of Assassins), and The Order of the Ancients (the Templar Order) which was responsible for the death of Bayek's son, Khemu, that leads our main protagonist into exile to seek vengeance.

GRAPHICS AND AUDIO ↴
I feel like Origins can easily join ranks amongst those games with an outstanding qualities and nearly perfect beautiful design. The vast expanse of the region we get to play in is breath-taking and definitely one of the most amazing environments I've seen. I'm not kidding when I say that everywhere you look you can see the jawdropping details of graphics and physics that are making this game almost ageless. And it's even futher complemented by things like an authentic feeling of this very fascinating time period of civil war the game is set but also an excellent lighting system, which actually makes you feel the dizzying heat of the sun as you explore each district with it's own unique and mysterious sights from the populated cities to hidden cavern passages to even underwater plains full of interesting treasures. And all of this is accompanied by a great score (could listen to the main theme for the rest of my life) and nicely done sound design that works well with the visuals of the game to immerse you into an amazing and intriguing atmosphere of Ancient Egypt. (Ps. Photo mode for the win!)

GAMEPLAY ↴
Compared to the previous games combat in AC Origins has been completley revamped. While the old system of an enemies was heavily based on them attacking you one at a time which made you capable of simply countering all their moves in a never-ending cycle, the new one is more of an RPG style that is significantly harder but also considerably more satisfying. One-on-one attacks are no longer applied but instead a variety of enemies with different attacks, from melee to long-ranged one, can start a fight with you more than two or even three at a time from every possible angle. Before you where getting an easy wins with pressing the counter symbol at a right time, however now to win combat scenarios it's essential for you to level up and have a good gear/weapons equipped (which we can have our pick of since the game offers us different classes of weapons and each one has its unique weight/stats that can provide usvwith a bit of a different way of playstyle). This gives the combat attacks quite the variety as the enemies will definitely not wait in line for their chance to take a hit at you anymore. I think this a great change in the system since now you can feel more like an assassin workin in the shadows to outsmart his foes and this is where we're getting a pretty huge emphasis on stealth and stategic thinking... simply analyzing the patterns, planing your attacks and all that or even finding a quick route of escape since it's no longer so easy to rush in to a fort, due to it being harder than it was before. And let me tell you that clearing out a whole camp of soldiers without even a single soul screaming out for alarm - satisfying as hell. I mean, sure, you can still try charging in there without planing anything out but don't be surprised if you fail miserably at killing your target and you end up as an avenge quest for other players to find. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

STORY ↴
When we start the game, the Assassin order does not even exist. Instead we learn a story of a Medjay, Bayek of Siwa at a time where the words "I am a Medjay. I am a feather in the eagle's wing... a living dagger, plunged from the sky into the heart of chaos. I am a truth unknown... a scabbard unfilled... a son of the Nile... and a defender of the people. You cannot kill me, for I walk among the dead. Come forth by day, and I will guide you home." are getting a new meaning after he suffers a great lost at the hands of a mysterious figures standing behind the Order of the Ancients which drastically changes his point of view and making him become Medjay to no pharaoh, a hidden one, a protector not only for the people of his region but the whole realm. And this where our journey begins...

PERFORMANCE, BUGS AND GLITCHES ↴
Ehh... there were a some lil' bugs and glitches but mostly the hilarious kind of ones. For example, the ship flying in the sky and then doing it's own re-edition of sinking Titanic, and like c'mon, that flying horse/camel doing cartwheel, anyone? I bet there are few more out there but I didn't encounter anything game-breaking.

CONCLUSION ↴
Origins left me deeply impressed not only with it's unique and breathtaking landscape that stretched for what felt like an eternity but also with the attention to detail for the main story set in Ancient Egypt as well as all the small but gripping story lines that painted an interesting picture for the player. It actually made me feel like every single minute was worth playing and this game without a doubt surpassed my expectations. I cannot find a single thing (except being forced to play as Aya) that I didn't enjoy in this insane world that's a completionist’s wet dream. Seriously, it was a joy to get lost in exploring. That's why I think it's a must have for adventure enthusiasts like me and all those who complain about this game being a walking simulator don't have a real appreciation for a masterpiece this game truly is. For me this entry in Assassin's Creed series is one of the best in the franchise as a whole and it's gonna be very hard to change my mind about that. My bff already tried, didn't worked at all.

Summary:

In 2016, no Assassin's Creed games were announced or released as Ubisoft took a year off to polish their next AC game and boy have they delivered. Assassin's Creed Origins is a awesome comeback for the series and while it still has those core AC elements we know and love, the game has taken a different approach from it's predecessors. It now follows an RPG style game, where you level up and can customise your character with all sorts of loot. The minimap has been ditched in favour of The Witcher 3 compass style navigation and it makes exploring the world much more interesting and fun. Combat has also been revamped and no longer follows the old system of counter and kill.

Game world:

Ptolemaic Egypt is massive and each location is filled with mini objectives that you do to complete the area, for example killing the captain and/or looting all the treasure. Each district in Egypt offers hours of content and are all unique in apperance. Due to the absence of the minimap, locations are now marked with a ? icon and similar to The Witcher 3 they can be discovered upon while wandering the massive world. This is the biggest AC open world to date and it certainly delivers an authentic feeling of the time period the game is set in. There is so much side content in the world that you end up getting distracted and straying away from the main quest very easily. Each side quest is unique and offers different stories which means that it does not become repetitive quickly.

Narrative:

The game's narrative differs from the previous games as it is not about the fight between the Templars and Assassins. When you start the game in AC Origins, the Assassin order does not even exist. As you play through the game you will find out about the people and ideas that ultimatley lead to the Assassin order being created. Each main quest I played was interesting and it gave me little bits of information about the beggining of the Assassin order. We all have grown tired of the same old "Assassins vs Templars" and I think AC Origins story is a nice refreshment from all that stuff.

Combat:

Combat in Assassin's Creed Origins has been completley revamped. If you remember the old system of an enemy attacking you one at a time and you countering all their moves over and over, you can be glad that this is no longer how combat works. Because the game is RPG style the combat is signnificantly harder. Enemies no longer attack one at a time but instead two or three would have a go at you at the same time. Before you could win fights just by countering when the symbol came up, however now to win combat scenarios you're going to have to be the same or a higher level than your enemis and also have strong weapons and gear equipped. This gives comabt in AC Origins variety as the enemies wouldn't wait one at a time. This combat change was greatly needed and I no longer rush in to a fort, due to it being harder than it was before.

Problems:

Assassin's Creed Origin's does not have much negatives however a major issue of this game is it's poor optimization. I have a GTX 970 4gb graphics card and I should be able to run the game at a solid 60 FPS due to me being able to run much more demanding games. I would always have around 45 FPS when playing but sometimes it would drop as low as 25 and it killed some of the enjoyment for me. Assassin's Creed on PC has generally had a bad history of optimization but I never really had it as bad as this. It stutters and lags at some intense moments but I'm glad I can at least mantain a playable FPS 90% of the time. The game eats up a lot of your CPU and Ram so if you have a less powerful CPU or less Ram you may encounter long loadings, stutter, textures not rendering quickly etc. These sort of ruin the experience and I wish Ubisoft would do better with AC on PC.

Conclusion:

You may ask "Should I get Assassin's Creed Origins?" the answer is yes. This game won't disappoint you it is filled with content and I am certain you will be spending hours trying to 100% this game. Assassin's Creed Origins has revived the series for many people and I believe that taking one year off has helped Ubisoft create an awesome AC game. If you're reluctant to give this game a go due to it's previous mistakes I would suggest you come back. This game deserves a chance it has in a way reinvented the series and I hope future releases can follow Origin's example.

Verdict:

9/10 Fantastic game!.

I've picked up and played at least 2-3 hours of every AC game except Odyssey and I've only liked Black Flag (completed ~ 70%) and Brotherhood (100%). I think I enjoyed Origins so much because it is greatly inspired by and features elements of exactly those 2 titles.

What I enjoyed most:
- The world is huge and filled with things to explore - cities, fortresses, temples, bandit camps, animal lairs, tombs etc. just like in Black Flag except this time the seas are filled with sand instead. Each region is unique in it's flora, inhabitants (greeks, romans, egyptians) and cities. Everything looks authentic and it's obvious that the designers did their research.
- The DLCs are really good. The hidden ones focuses more on classic assassinations and Curse of the pharaohs on mythology. If you have the coin, I strongly suggest purchasing the Gold edition while on sale.
- Since the game's release, it has received a lot of quality of life and content updates- discovery tour, Anubis boss fights and Animus control panel, which allows you to modify parameters of the game, like making your hidden blade instantly kill enemies.
- The main character, Bayek, resembles Ezzio a lot. He's charismatic, drops a joke or a pun here and there, has a deep sense of honor and justice despite the fact that his own life was messed up. Plus the voice actor did a tremendous job.

What bothered me:
- Unfortunately I can't say the same for the rest of the voice actors- the Romans and Cleo have British accents, the side quest voice actors (except in Curse of the pharaohs DLC) were simply horrible. I had to skip dialog cause I simply couldn't listen to their tirades.
- The side quest range from annoying fetch missions (go to point X, kill bandits/corrupt soldiers/wild animals>collect item>return to quest giver) to really immersive quests about ancient Egyptian traditions and daily life. Of course you don't know what the quality of the quest will be before you start it. I think I managed to pick up most of the good side quests and skipped some of the filler content.

After Assassin's Creed Unity, things looked grim for the AC franchise. After an embarrasing launch in an already turbulent year for Ubisoft, I became disinterested in the AC franchise after loyally following it since the first game. In some ways, this was to be expected after 3 games focusing solely on Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the franchise's most memorable character and the shift towards yearly releases.

Then I saw the trailer for Assassin's Creed Origins and my curiosity started. I pre-ordered the game literally the day before it came out. I dreaded the moment it became playable as I was fearing another Unity. And I am glad I was wrong. Assassin's Creed Origins is a true return to form for a franchise that has passed through a VERY rough phase.

The game is set during Ptolemic Egypt, a country with a history stretching back thousands of years. Once a proud kingdom, now a divided region, torn between Ptolemy XIII and his sister/wife Cleopatra fighting for control. At the same time, old tensions are flaring up again while a new emergent power is also taking an interest in Egypt. You play as Bayek of Siwa, a Medjay or a Protector.

The setting is very fascinating as it focuses on a period of civil war in a country that had a long history, a history that is visible all around the map in the game. The story is engaging, albeit at the start there are pacing issues but bear with them as it gets interesting later.

The gameplay is heavily influenced by Witcher 3 and I have to say, it works really well for this. The RPG element is useful and should be further improved in successive games. One element I agree is a tad problematic is the combat system. It takes a short time to learn but a long time to master. The storyline is linear but this has always been the case with AC. What is open is how you tackle objectives or conduct assassinations, allowing you to take on enemies through a variety of ways.

However, for me one feature really stood out. On February 2018, Ubisoft released the Discovery Tour. It allows the player to explore the entire region without any limitations such as combat. To see the setting with complete freedom, to see the details the production crew put in is very impressive. The feature also has tours which focus on particular aspects of the era, from mummification rituals to Egyptian beer to Greek education to Roman crucifiction. As an archaeologist, I find it extremely well-researched and the production crew also explain certain design choices, like the Sphinx having colour even though by Cleopatra's time, it had long lost the colours. This way you appreciate the detail and effort they took to present that history and this could potentially be very useful in educating the public about the wonders of Ancient Egypt so it is a breath of fresh air in this day and age (*cough History Channel *cough).

All in all, I thoroughly recommend this game to everyone, old fans and new people interested in the franchise. You do not have to play the previous games in order to understand what is going on. The modern sections isn't that great but this franchise was always about the past. Full price is worth it but if you're strapped, wait for a sale. The wait would be worth it in the end. It seems that Ubisoft has learnt its lesson and is avoiding yearly releases. The franchise has the potential for a great comeback and can also serve in educating people who are interested in learning more about the setting (which in turn makes you appreciate the effort they took).

What did we expect? A new reppetitive assassin's creed game. What did we get? A whole new definition of what assassin's creed truly means. The game's rpg elements remind me of the Witcher 3 (also a great game) and provide a refreshing and new playstyle. We got what we loved in assassin's creed 2. A story about vengeance! An interesting character and a whole new world to explore. The map is huge, although the desert area's in the south and west are practically empty. Yes there are microtransactions, but none of them are really necessary as there is plenty of content.

Assassin’s Creed is back

I’ve waited a long time for a good Assassin’s creed game. I loved the first game and second one was my favorite until now. Barely forced myself to finish AC3 and Unity was a complete crap. Didn’t even played Syndicate since I didn’t want to waste my time and money. But Origins surprised me.

Gameplay is similar to the previous games but improved. Combat is finally fixed and is quite fun, it’s not clunky and unresponsive anymore. It could be better of course, but I’m totally ok with how it is now, I love it. One thing which surprised me is archers. When you try kill them they run away and you end up chasing them, really nice. Climbing and running through obstacles is smooth as never before. You don’t get stuck anymore. Even when you’re riding your camel or horse you don’t get stuck behind object, you automatically jump over them. And small things like marking the objective on the map and then you simply press a button and you follow the road automatically until you reach your destination makes your life easier. Though I must say this doesn’t always work correctly, AI sometimes can’t find a correct path. Another small thing. Don’t you hate when you need to follow an npc and you both move at different pace when you run a little, then walk slowly? Now you move at the same pace as npc automatically, small but very good improvement. And you have a little friend – an eagle which is used to scout the area and mark the enemies and treasures. Also you can hunt animals for resources and you need resources to craft and improve your gear. Weapons and armor are done similarly to rpg games. Everything has levels now, you need to reach a certain level to equip a certain weapon or a piece of clothing. When you level up you get an ability point which is used to unlock new skills. Enemies are done in rpg manner too and the map is broken into zones by level, so like in rpg games you can't go to a 20lvl zone fight 20lvl enemies if you're only 5lvl.

Gameplay basically consists of doing the main quest and a bunch of side quests. Main quest has a decent story. Like that blockbuster movie which is fun to watch, you have a good time but it’s nothing too special. Most side quests are generic but some have really nice background stories and some are hilarious. But good side quests make maybe 5% off all quests.
I don’t want this game to be too complicated or difficult, you get a quest, you go to a marked location and do what is required. This is a relaxing game for me, you run around, kill people, uncover the map, climb structures, collect loot and so on. You can take a stealth approach or go Rambo style. And burning arrows, oh thank you for another small feature. When you take your bow and aim to the fire you get a flaming arrow. This is a nice little feature. Previous games felt a little boring and sometimes frustrating and annoying like Unity, in this one it doesn’t get boring while doing the same stuff over and over again. After each quest you want to do another one and then another one etc.

Graphics. Wow this game is gorgeous. I must say previous games were great looking too, but this is just another level. It’s stunning, architecture is beautifully done, it's almost photo realistic, the buildings are done to the smallest of detail. Also character models are of highest quality. No matter if your running around the city or inside some building, you're running through a field or ride your camel through a desert – everything looks stunning. And it has a photo mode. Press LS+RS to enter the photo mode. You get various filters and other adjustments. At first I thought you cannot take steam screenshots since the overlay didn’t disappear, but I found out if you wait a few seconds the overlay disappears and you can hit that F12. The detail is amazing, you can close up to animals, take portraits and see every little detail.

Now about the so much talked performance. I know some people are having problems but not me. This is one the most smoothest games I have. It runs very smooth at constant 60fps on ultra settings. No fps drops or anything, just locked 60fps, no difference Alexandria or desert. The game is really well optimized, I can’t say anything bad about performance.

Now on to negatives. Season pass price is too high. The full experience costs 90€ and if you buy it separately it’s 100€. That’s just too much. I'm not going to pay 40€ for a season pass when i don't even know if it's good or not.
Another negative is microtransactions. You can buy stuff for real money. I rather use cheats, but not going to spend a dime on mtx. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way! While Ubisoft has improved a lot in the past years there’s still a room for improvement.
There's too little real content. The game is pretty short. The map is empty and filled with generic quests and question marks. There's nothing to do except clearing outposts and collecting worthless treasure. It lacks content.

If you’re a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ like me or a fan of Assassin’s Creed it’s a good game to buy, actually the best game in the series after ACII. If you’re a fan of open world games and love some action it's a good choice. But it gets pretty boring after you finish the short story and lacks content. Get this on sale.

Pros:
Improved gameplay
Stunning graphics
Great performance
Steam achievements
Cons:
Microtransactions
Season pass is overpriced
Side quests could be better
Not a lot of content

Product received for free

I had no intention of getting this game. The previous games had been up and down in terms of story, gameplay and overall technical quality. Unity bored me, I couldn't be bothered with Syndicate. And when I heard of microtransactions in Origins as well, I had no reason whatsoever for getting Origins. But a friend bought it for me and wanted to experience it together with me and I felt I had to give it a go for his sake.

And I must say: I enjoyed it. Quite a lot, even.

It borrows liberally from Witcher III in terms of combat mechanics and world building. And although I don't think it reaches that level of quality, the end result of AC Origins is well worth it. It has a large and for me surprisingly varied map, with a lot of locations, missions and other activities.

The story is fairly standard AC fare: the Assassins (in all but name here) fighting against oppression by killing evil megalomaniacs and hundreds of underpaid soldiers. Ubisoft seems to realize by now that most people don't give a fig about the modern day story anymore (if they ever did). I myself gave up on it after Brotherhood and purely enjoyed the later games for the gameplay and historical setting. All I'll say is that just like in some of the previous games, the modern day alien conspiracy element has very little prominence, and I think it's a better game for it.


The map itself is beautiful. From vibrant and colourful in the Nile Delta to arid and desolate in the rolling desert dunes. It is filled to the brim with locations, quests and side activities. While many of the side missions are fairly unimaginative (get item/npc X from stronghold Y for npc Z), there are a good many too that have a bit more narrative to them. Ubisoft has done a good job of making the world seem alive and believable, even though (I'm no expert) they probably took quite a bit of liberty with historical accuracy. Speaking of which: I quite miss the history blurbs and glossary from previous games. They added a nice layer of depth to the game. Blast it, Shaun, you've been slacking!

The mechanics, while not groundbreaking, are solid and fun. Sneaking and climbing felt very much like Black Flag: fairly simple but solid (though occasionally finicky, especially the parkour. Why didn't they expand on the previous system?). The way strongholds and missions are set up lends itself very well to sneak approaches and for me it was enjoyable. The addition of a bow especially makes sneaking around and combat in general more fun. Melee combat recieved some updates from previous AC games. While it didn't have all of the same fluidity, again it felt quite a bit like Witcher III (and like in Witcher, enemies with shields are a pain in the backside). But the combat system works well and getting into combat doesn't feel like punishment, as was the case in some other AC games. There's a good selection of melee weapons with their own move sets and finishers to match your playstyle. Mounted combat is equally satisfying (although a bit repetitive), and I felt my inner Mount & Blade player assert itself again; run into enemy outposts and make passes on enemy groups while whacking them with spear and sword.

I feel like I need to mention microtransactions. Although I perfectly despise the very notion of putting a cash shop in a $/€60 predominantly single player experience, and can't condone it in any way, I don't feel like it bothered me at all during gameplay. It just felt so very optional. No obnoxious advertisements, no obvious pay to win rubbish. Earning money and resources in-game is no big hassle (decidedly fun for me, in fact). Legendary gear is not very difficult to get without paying a single real life cent, and I never felt tempted to do so. Skins and time-savers mostly for those that want it, but nothing too insidious.

On the techical side, there were a few (mostly visual) bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking. I don't have the most powerful PC, but the game ran decently well on my system. No major frame dips or anything, but YMMV ofcourse. And I liked how the options menu gives good previews of the graphics options. Really helps well with setting up your game.

In conclusion: nothing spectacular, but a worthy solid AC game. Ubisoft did well skipping a year with AC releases, it paid off handsomely. If I were forced to give it a mark, I'd give 7/10. I could be persuaded into giving an 8 if they cut out the cash shop and fixed the minor glitches.

This was a difficult choice. "Do I recommend it?" and I've gone back and forth between "No, but" and "Yes, if" a lot. This is a stunning looking game, with some of the most amazing environments I've seen. You start in the town of Siwa, decently sized and lovingly detailed, and I thought it would be maybe 10% of the world map. No, it isn't even 1%. The lush Nile delta, the pyramids of Giza, Alexandria with its greek buildings, Memphis with its Egyptian. Mountains, deserts, valleys, villages, temples, monuments, garrisons, fields, breweries, butchers, brickmakers, weavers, slums, palaces. Everywhere you look you can see jawdropping vistas, and weeks and months and years of work put in by some of the best environmental artists in the business. Exploring this world and seeing the inhabitants go about their daily life is the best part of the game. The main plot on the other hand, is the usual drawn out cliched tales of revenge and supernatural conspiracies you would expect from the Assassin's Creed series, punctuated by AAA scenes of action bombast. Lovingly rendered, and very dumb. A bunch of people with nothing in common and no motivation apart from gaining power, being moustashe-twirlingly evil, and being members of the Order of Ancients needs opposing, so around you go supposedly creating a better word by slitting their throats, and the throats of literally thousands of enemy soldiers just doing their job.

The world is filled with quests, a few memorable, most of them forgettable MMO like fare - investigate this, explore that, kill him, find her. In order to finish the game you will have to do a fair few of these side quests, or you won't have a high enough level to stand a chance in later regions that open up. Combat is fairly satisfying, I played on hard and I died a fair number of times until I learned the different enemies and their strengths and weaknesses. When to block, when to dodge, when to shieldsmash and when to sneak around and assassinate.

Despite my complaints about the writing, the exploration and world is just so good that it, together with the non-violent Exploration Module which teach you about the history of Egypt is enough to tip this into a "Yes, you should absolutely get this." Just be aware that it will take a while to play through it, and don't try to force your way through as many MMO quests as possible. Do a few of the most interesting when you feel like it, and climb on top of a rookery or pyramid occasionally and take in the scenery.

Assassin’s Creed Origins
Assassin's Creed Origins is a open world, action, stealth, rpg and a game which changed Assassin's Creed forever.

Origins is the first of its type in this franchise and people are not often too happy about changes. Since I’m a big fan of the older Assassin’s Creed games I was a bit hesitate at first but after playing it for a bit I started to enjoy the new type of gameplay and its features.

Is Origins a bad game? Simply said: No it really isnt but its something different from what we have seen from this franchise and it made a lot of good changes in my opinion. If you like RPGs, stealth games and fights with quite a bit of action you might also like Assassin’s Creed Origins since this game is a mix out of all of those genres.

Story

The player is controlling Bayek of Siwa who is looking for the people that were responsible for his sons death. His wife Aya of Alexandria is joining Bayek in his path of vengeance. Throughout the story the plot thickens and the player will encounter famous characters like Cleopatra VII and Julius Caesar.

The Story is very Assassin’s Creed like with the usual fair share of actual historical events and made up things that the player discovers throughout the playthrough. The whole events of Origins are set in the ancient egypt which is quite a cool setting for me personally – if you like the setting you should give it a try.

Personal note

When I started playing this game I was quite hesitate as I mentioned earlier. I couldnt imagine how an Assassin’s Creed game could become an RPG. After playing it for maybe 6 hours I started to like the changes and the new possibilities that Origins implemented.

I was a bit disappointed that the focus of Origins wasnt mainly on the stealth gameplay, which older games, in this franchise were so focused on. After a while I learned to like that though, since sometimes you dont feel like sneaking through a whole garrison when you simply can take a fight.

I quickly started to do some side quests instead of following the main quest which kind of boosted me because I was leveling quite fast, which gave me an advantage when I came back to do the main story line. I really fell in love with being able to do whatever I liked to do – when I felt like doing some exploring while following some side quest plots, I was able to do so and it felt so fresh with the RPG elements in the game.

Rating
Pros
The fighting feels pretty good
The RPG elements are well executed
Eagle Vision ability is pretty cool
Freedom that allows you to explore and / or do side quests
The Story is well made and makes sense after a while
There is a lot of stuff to do if you really want to do it
The graphics are pretty good
The cities feel alive
The characters are well developed and have some depth
Photomode – something I really love since I started to take screenshots more often
Cons
The controls on the keyboard are a bit weird (which is nothing new but still an issue at times)
The Photomode controls are not convenient for keyboard users
Sometimes the FPS drops which is weird since my rig isnt the issue
Some areas of the map seem too empty
The voice of Bayek is too loud and there is no option to turn it down
The game can be grindy at times
Conclusion

Is Assassin's Creed Origins a good game? I would say it is. It was a lot of fun to play through the story and the side quests - I also found myself taking lots of screenshots and just admiring the ancient egypt and its cities.

Origins is worth your money if you like the Assassin's Creed franchise and if you're looking for a game which takes you a while to play through. It took me roughly 50 hours to finish the main story - I did a lot of exploring and side questing as well but at the same time I still have so much to do.

8.4 / 10

"I will be judged one day, but I do not regret my actions. The feather will always be lighter than my heart." Bayek of Siwa

This is a good game.
I believe it's the best AC to date for a number of reasons.

-Super glad they took this new direction into RPG territory, it was much needed.
It's something I been personally asking and wishing for, and it paid off bigtime.
-The visual are absolutely stunning, at many points throughout the game I asked myself how did that.
I was running at 4K 60fps smooth. The most gorgeous graphics I've seen in any game so far.
And the water, the water is simply revolutionary, never seen water done so perfectly.
-The main mission is really fun and very interesting. And so is the gameplay overall.

My only complaint would be that, as much as this game is better than its predecessors and more into RPG, the side missions are really missing something. For the most part side missions are mediocre, uninspired, except a few, and they are borderline fetch quests that give little incentive to do them. A few incentivize you with gorgeous gear, but for the most part, they are meh.
And the side tasks, those are abysmal, a total repetitive and boring chore to do.

TLDR: A Good game, with stunning visuals, much better for bringing RPG elements to the table with hopes they bring more RPG into it.
But can be a lot more fun and addictive if they work harder on their side missions and tasks, to make them more interesting and less of a repetitive chore.

After nearly 100 hour in this game, i can say i am totaly stunned.
I did never expected a publisher could do such a good work, after messing up a hole game serie.
But actually they did turn arround and focused on the strong points of Assassins Creed.
First of all they show an amazing world. The view is great and you have the feeling to be really back in time.
You do not have to go to towers anymore to see whats arround you, you only need to go to these places to fast travel.
The game gives you the option to finish it in different ways.
You want to fight against 20 enemies sure, or no one should see you also possible, or you let your enemies fight themselfs no problems.
I needed these 90+ hours to actually use all option of fighting in this game.
And when i talk about fighting they make it so much better than this parry conter thing before.
The side missions are often the same but somehow they managed, that you never get the feeling they are.
So to put all together. This game brings nothing new, but put all good things together what an open world game should do and is pulling out the best out of this.
I can not wait for the DLCs to come and to see if they keep up with this great work or not, the future will show.
I say get the game and see it yourself, i am sure its worse the price (and ofcause even more worse it on sale ;) ).

Oh boy...

Assassin's Creed: Origins is the first Assassin's Creed game I've played, in earnest, since ACIII. I've played bits and pieces of Black Flag, Rogue, Syndicate and even less of Unity. Though, I think most people would recite the trilogy with Ezio Auditore da Firenze as some of the best games in the series.

At the time of writing this, I have just finished the main story with considerable but not all side missions/content completed, at roughly 86 hours. I've purchased the Gold Edition and await the Hidden Ones and Curse of the Pharaohs DLC. But, I wanted to express my thoughts and pontificate the main game on its own.

The Last of the Medjay.
In Origins, you'll play as Bayak of Siwa during the last Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt with the impending encroachment of the new Roman Empire readily apparent.

Origins is relatively more story focused than previous iterations of Assassin's Creed. However, it's still kind of “bloated” as you've likely heard the series described. And running around and killing captains for loot that's probably not any better than what you've already got isn't going to appeal to everyone. Though, if you're someone that plays Far Cry for instance, and resets the outposts such that you can kill everybody again — you'll likely very much enjoy these side location objectives replete throughout the map. I will say that through doing these essentially exploration objectives that I ran into many things I'd not have expected: 

There is almost nothing in common with older Assassin's Creed games here.
Except the parkour and climbing on a lot of things to synchronize with the animus.

Combat is much more direct, no longer can you stand there and press counter when your definitely not spider-sense goes off and subsequently destroy an entire garrison with relative ease. It's still essentially a hack n' slash but the weapon types behave differently and vary the combat in a non-trivial way that I really appreciate. The bows are especially different. Hunter bows are designed for powerful draws, warrior bows are effectively ancient shotguns, light bows — repeating rifles. Predator bows... these go into first person to let you aim, once leveled, you'll be able to sixaxis manipulate the arrow in slow motion as it travels.

Origins seems to be heavily inspired by Witcher 3 and Destiny. Which is not a bad thing by any means, it's just... “perhaps investigating what happened here” — will lead to a legendary bow. Origins now conflates loot and leveling into the main structure of the game. You can even turn on level scaling. I don't recommend this however.

Assassin's Creed is possibly the most unintentionally meta-game ever made.
You play as Layla Hassan in the modern times, who is inside of a machine, effectively playing the game that you are actually playing. But, it's fine because it's all a part of the lore.

To bring this point further, might you want to avenge player Anubis05841? How about partaking in a timed event such as the Trial of Sekhmet for some rare Anubis gear? Not your cup of tea? Then try your luck with the daily mission from Reda the Nomad Trader for a daily reward — whom will also happily oblige you in taking 3000 drachmas in exchange for a lootbox. Due to this technically taking place in a machine — in a machine. It actually makes sense. Which I love... and hate.

Yes, there are micro-transactions. Mostly cosmetic. Some “time-saver” ones as well. All completely optional. Though, I hear your argument design wise, some aspects may be more drawn out than usual to encourage you to buy “Helix Credits” — the credits you buy with real life money. I understand that argument, and I'm rather nonplussed about it. At the end of the day, if you don't want it, don't buy it.

THE GIST:
Assassin's Creed Origins is absolutely one of my favorite AC games. If only for the setting. Ancient Egypt is rife with mystery and makes a perfect setting for a game of this nature. When you add the new gameplay elements to it that dramatically change what was once an arguably dying IP, you've got yourself a great resurgence of interest.

More here — Station Argus

Some technical gumbo:
The graphical presets seem to be completely out of hand. I was able to get the game running at around 40-60fps at 1080p on mostly Very High settings with a few on medium or turned off. Some of the settings seem to have a dramatic effect on performance with virtually no change in visually quality. While others have dramatic effect on visual quality while the performance is virtually unchanged.

i7 - 4820k
12 GB DDR3
6GB GTX1060
No overclock.

I didn't actually mean to take this image with the overlay but it's worked out for the purpose of this review.


I forgot to turn off afterburner. Failed to recreate composition. :D

Recommended? (AKA tl;dr)

If you somehow like the "Ubisoft-Formula" of map-clearing? Yes! They definately worked on that and made it way better, more rewarding and more enjoyable. The best iteration of their formula so far.
I disliked previous Assasin's Creed titles mostly because they grew boring after a few minutes, yet this one is highly enjoyable, if not only for the incredibly awesome (and refreshing) setting and its sheer beauty. So often
I wandered (well...rode) off the planned path just because of that "omg, wow, what is that?"-factor. I spent 30 hours before I even went a step ahead in the main-quest :-)
Let's just say there's one achievement in the heat of the desert that...well ,-)

I hope that this in-game-shop-♥♥♥♥ from Ubisoft is the maximum we'll see. I can make my peace with the way it currently is. Games like these costs serious bucks, so if they can make it worth their while with people who are fine to cheat with money or buy cosmetic fun-items? Well, fine. Just don't never ever ever try to force anything down my throat in a damn single-player!
The exclusion of the map-coordinates for three collectible-side-quests is...on the edge of acceptable. You can surely look them up in the web or will find them anyway if you're an explorer, but...


The good (what to love):
Cats will follow you curiously and you should not...errr...kill them, because they're sacred. Yesyes, so I've heard, I would never try of course ;-)
Some really refreshing new setting/theme. That ancient Egypt is breathtakingly beautiful.
Insanely beautiful. Scenery, characters, everything is really extremely well done with a passion for detail. Lovely.
Combat has been vastly improved over the previous titles and ranges from fun to challenging.
Wide range of options. Even a very valuable "Dialogue boost" in Audio. Neat!
Vast map, millions of quests, tread one meter and you have another thing to do. A completionists dream or nightmare, whatever :-)
That eagle for reconnaissance is a nice thing. Nearly as much fun as the drone in Wildlands (as it's more passive)
Ubisofts achievements are funnier than Steams. Accumulate points and actually get something in-game (or in another game) for it. I like it. Tip: Get the one quest first, and skip the gear (you'll find plenty and better)!
Side-quest-quality has vastly improved. Though they rarely reach a Witcher III's niveau, they're good enough to keep you going.
World is nicely alive. People work, sleep, talk. Animals hunt, flee, sleep and even fight.
No bugs seen yet, not even some misaligned texture.
Mounts are fun and responsive, felling right. Mounted combat too. Very enjoyable.
You can have your mount "auto-run" (just following the street or navigating to your way-point). While doing that you can call your eagle and watch yourself riding or scout the area or whatever.


The mediocre (neither good nor bad, or simply not objectively either):
Some "multi-player"-elements like in "Shadow of War": Avenge some random people's death. Nice for a lil extra XP, but a real immersion-killer. Why? "Avenge the death of ♥♥♥♥♥Destroya69". Some people have poetic tags...
Typical Ubisoft-Formula: Map-clearing. BUT not as boring as in their other titles. Quite the contrary actually. They learned.
In-game-Shop. BUT Ubisoft is fair here (for now!). Just cosmetic stuff or "time-saving" stuff for the super-lazy. Back in the day we called them cheats. Now they're a business-model. Smart move.
You can also buy "loot-boxes" with in-game-money and be able to receive the item-store-items. Bought two and got a legendary mount and armor, each for 9,99 in the store. You can even cheat in-game-money instead of buying if you so wish. With such a system I could make my peace. Some extra cash for the dev from the super-lazy but still no feeling of "ugh I really need that item".
Quick item-pickup (means: no animation). Even from a mounts back. Immersion-killer for some, immensely nice thing for me.
It can become a bit "grindy". But only if intend on maxing out your gear and upgrade it all. Then you'll spend a lot of time gathering resources. It doesn't force you into the shop though, as you don't need it all. And if you enjoy the game, a bit of grinding is no grinding at all.


The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):
Double DRM. Besides normal ugly Denuvo the whole things actually runs in a VM. Can you believe this? So if you'd wonder why the game constantly uses 100% of all your CPUs cores...that's why. Yet I understand the need for more and more drastic measures to counter piracy, I totally hate it to be the moron who pays with CPU-life for that, while pirates just wait a lil longer and can enjoy it without that crap (not yet so far, so at least it's working).
Too much random chatter from random people in a language most of us don't understand anyway. Can get quite annoying when riding through a city and every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NPC talks some stuff to you. Are they all retarded or what's their problem? :-) Actually that's the worst thing in the game, I wonder how no one in QA complained about it...
I have to start the game 2-5x each time to get it finally running. What the bloody hell is that magic?!

At this point there are two main series of Assassin's Creed games...the first ones being the Altair/Ezio & Desmond games (Ac1, Ac2, Brotherhood, Revelations +Ac3) and then all the rest...

There's a definitive line drawn after Ac3 (even if that game wasn't good, it was still with Desmond and the original story... for better or worse!) The truth is after the ending of Assassin’s Creed itself in Ac 3 , Ubisoft departed greatly from the original gameplay and story (except one more game later that sadly didn't go out so well) and so, Assassin's Creed lost its identity to the point of not being recognizable even to the players of the first games, and yet at the same time, Ubisoft kept trying to exploit the success of the "name" and the original series by coming up with a new title (almost) every year because, who knows, maybe they were afraid of starting something new.

To be sincere and less subjective, there were some good attempts here...of course...

The new series started with AC 4 Black Flag which was a good game, but... it didn't have ANYTHING to do with Assassin’s being a sea adventure... and pirates (?!)
Then Ac Unity arrived and it was finally, a return to what was like playing an Assasin's Creed game... it was about parkour, free movement, stealth, big city to climb, and other places to hide, but improved in some ways and the story side of things had potential. But the game had problems.
The main story had the french revolution chronology completely messed up and disorganized, if you didn't knew about the history period it would be impossible to follow what was hapening in game, the side missions being copy paste of each other a hundred times, and incredibly, the voices of the French characters had english accent…
Then AC Syndicate was announced and after seeing some gameplay i decided just there... i wasn't even going to try that game.

So after all this it's safe to say that i wasn't at all excited about Ac Origins. Of course i like Ancient Egypt as much as the next guy, but that doesn't mean Ubi can take any historical period they want, just throw you in the middle of it with nice looking graphics and expect you to just like it already right ? I mean... that's what they did with the last three games but still :D

Ashraf Ismail was the director of Black Flag and again here in Ac Origins and it shows.
I didn't like Black Flag, just because i wasn't interested in playing a pirates game , but that wasn't a bad game.

With Ac Origins i do like the idea of being lost in the desert with a camel (or a Legendary horse! ;) and this comes from someone who played a lot of Egypt games back in the 90s , i liked them but after so much Egypt i was pretty tired (especially because all the games were similar) but with Ac Origins, to say it goes deep into Egyptian mythology (without being too heavy, if you are just a casual) but deep enough that it does seem to add something more, to show Egypt like you never seen before, like they done a proper investigation and respected the subject (not unlike what they did with the French Revolution) that is saying a lot.

And while the main story of this game... fails to do justice, if you explore the map enough and go deep, very deep in its land, you will be surprised of how many things you can find.

To be honest here, this is possibly the least Assassin's Creed game of all Assassin's Creed... and that's good! when Assassin's Creed Origins forgets everything about Assassin's Creed and it just lets itself be what it is, a game about Ancien Egypt with great historical research a great land to explore and great gaming parts, it just shines and amazes and becomes one of the better games that came out of the Ubisoft factory since Patrice Désilets, the creator of Assassin’s Creed, left the company.

Then at the end, same as Black Flag, when it tries to relate with the firsts games it is too little to late... the connection to those games comes just at the last moment of the last couple of missions, some special objects and symbols here and there over the game...some bad excuses for the origin of some traditions... it seems forced and unnecesary...

In fact, Ashraf Ismail's game could be even better if he just wasn't trying to continue with the impossible task of relaunching again and again the Assassin's Creed saga wich has long ended since 2012.

As for the game itself, Assassin's Creed Origins takes chances, it dares to be quite different from the previous Assassin's creed games, and that's one of the reasons it works so well (as a game) It is fun, it makes sense, it is full of great characters that are full of life and expression (it is indeed a beautiful game to take photographs!) and in the end it does show respect for the Assassin's Creed legacy, (although the main story fails, the game and the exploration works excellent, including the side activities.)

Contrary to previous games in these last years, the side missions are generally good and sometimes pretty good, there are also other sides activities like the circle of stones wich is a nice adition to relax, the gladiator arena and also you have many tombs to explore (and the pyramids of course) which is great although i would've prefered more in depth exploration with them)

As for the main story it has a rough start, there is a short 3 minutes video, and that's it, you don't totally get Bayek at first, who he is, what he wants, why he is doing what he's doing (you start already with one assasination done and you don't know why) and it takes a long time to even finish the prologue (the main titles comes up after playing several hours) But...once the story starts going, and you meet Aya the game finds its rythm and it flows really well (as an Ancient Egypt game where you are a Medjay) and it has nothing to do with anything else really.
Then towards the end, the brotherhood is created...but... it seems unrelated, there's no real origin story there’s, just the spark, but then nothing happens . You don't get to see how it connects to the future chapters of the series.

Then the bad guys, the so called "The order" are unmasked but you never get to know anything about them really... and whats up with the head these guys worship?

And even before the ending, the main story of this game while it is well represented, and well acted, it does come out as short and doesn't have a lot of development.
The main missions are 20. By comparison the side missions are more than 100!! and that without counting tombs, and other side activities. All that side content, in this game is pretty well done, but i would GLADLY change half of that content, for more main missions to develop more the main characters and the main story. In fact, the game is really too long and at the same time feels too short because of a very weak main campaign. For example, the main character Aya is pretty interesting at first, but finally you don't get to see her too much (aside from being badass wich is cool) ... but in the end she becomes a little shallow) By comparison for example, Elise from Ac Unity even in that mess of a story manages to develop a lot and i still think she's the better female protagonist of any Ac game (yeah, even better than Aveline in Ac Liberation). And it doesn't do any good to just have so much side content if the main story suffers. Because that's all that remains long after the end.

That's really my only main gripe about this game. Because the game itself is really good. And i think it is about time Ubisoft let Ashraf Ismail do his own original game to see what he (and the team of course) are really capable off.
And as for Assassin's Creed ? I really liked this game, it was fun, and showed me a love and respect for Egypt that i truly cared and enjoyed while playing and sure, Ubi can make a dozen more of these games if they want, but i think it's time to finish here and try new things. Isn't that what it's all about?

Best Assassin's Creed for me by now. Insane world, beautiful landscapes, wildlife. This game can inspire you to study more about Egypt and Antiquity.
In one word - masterpiece. Every minute was worth playing this game. I checked every corner in main game and DLC's - it was like a holiday that i didnt have because of coronavirus spreading aroud the world.

Introduction:

After 360+ hours in the game I just completed everything there is to do and I can finally give you guys a good (spoiler free) review of Assassin’s Creed Origins. Assassin's Creed Origins is a game set in the beautiful Ancient Egypt and is the origin story of the franchise. You play as Bayek, a retired medjay who seeks revenge because of events that took place before the main game. Assassin's Creed Origins is an RPG, Open World, Stealth, Adventure and Action game developed by Ubisoft Montreal, published Ubisoft, directed by both Jean Guesdon and Ashraf Ismail, written by Alain Mercieca, produced by Martin Schelling and composed by Sarah Schachner. This game runs on the AnvilNext 2.0 engine and it came out October 27, 2017 on both PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. This game is perfect for people who like RPG, Open World, Stealth, Adventure and Action games Assassin’s Creed Origins is the latest installment in the franchise.

Story:

The story of Assassin's Creed Origins is amazing and also pretty long. For me it took around 40 hours to complete just the main story and I really liked the conecpt of how the it all started. You play as Bayek who is a retired medjay. Bayek is a very good protagonist and actually my second favorite protagonist after Ezio in the franchise.

Open World:

The open world in this game is amazing and takes place in ancient Egypt. When I played the game I stopped so many times just to appreciate the beautiful environment Ubisoft has created for this title and there is even big cities with amazing detailed architecture to explore. The cities themselves was very alive and filled with people to interact with and each city felt unique in it's own way when you visited them. There is a lot of things to do and see in this game and a few of them is to explore ruins and tombs, climbing pyramids, fighting in the gladiator arenas, join the hippodromes races, visit the Sphinx, explore underwater and so much more.

Combat:

The combat system in Assassin's Creed Origins is greatly improved as well and much harder and not as easy as the other games combat is. But it was hard but in a fair way and you really felt rewarded after defeating the enemy. I also really am happy with the new combat system just because it feels a lot more stable and not as clunky as the previous games from the franchise. But after you play for a while you will get used to the combat system and understand it.

Ability System:

In this game there is also a brand new awesome ability system. When you level you, you gain ability points that you can spend on new abilities and I overall liked the abilites I got and felt so rewarded when I unlocked them.

Gameplay:

This time around Assassin's Creed Origins is not your standard AC game but more like an RPG game and I really like that Ubisoft went down that road because I can honestly say that they nailed that aspect of the game. This game also delivers a lot of mission variety which is a big step forwards compared to the other games in the franchise. I also like that the parkour feels way much smoother and better developed. Another thing I liked as well was the new hunting and crafting system. You can use your eagle called Senu and mark the animals or resources to now where they are. You can either hunt or find resources to upgrade your personal gear but this time it felt important to do it and I felt very motivated to do it as well. For me I didn’t feel like I had to grind to get resources like you did in the previous games. There are parts in this game which make the game feel very realistic and one of them are hallucinations you can get when you are in the desert regions because of the heat. You can also tame animals so they can assist you in battle for example, just like in Far Cry Primal for example. This games loot system was also very good and simple which is awesome and I hope that the other games in the future goes by this loot system.

Graphics:

The graphics and the visuals in this game is simply amazing, I think this game actually is one of the best looking games out there. You can explore environments like deserts, swamps, waters and much more. The details looks so realistic with the AnvilNext 2.0 game engine and people who really like the Ancient Egypt era will not be disappointed at all.

Discovery Tour:

In the Discovery Tour you get to explore different locations across the world and also learn more about them. I really liked this new feature to the franchise and I hope that the Discovery Tour will be in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey as well.


Trial of the Gods:

In the Trial of the Gods you actually get to fight different ancient Egyptian gods which is awesome and you also get rewards for doing so.

DLC:

The Hidden Ones:

This DLC is a great expansion to Bayek’s story after the events of Assassin’s Creed Origins base game. The events of this DLC takes place 4 years after the main game and in The Hidden Ones you get see the start of The Brotherhood. I think this DLC gives the player great content besides that the main story of the DLC itself is very short. It took me around 3-4 hours to complete the main story and I was kind of surprised how short it actually was compared to the main story of Curse of the Pharaohs expansion which took me almost 12 hours to completed. I would say that if you liked the base game you will like this expansion but just beware that the main story of the DLC is short but has a new region with side stuff to explore and do which is awesome.

Curse of the Pharaohs:

This DLC is my favorite DLC to an Assassin’s Creed game and I really find this expansion great just because of the amount of content you really get from it. Curse of the Pharaohs is the longest of the two DLC’s available and it’s about when Bayek gets a quest to help the city of Thebes and help them with strange events taking place in city. This expansion lets you travel to new regions to explore and even regions from the beautiful Afterlife to explore. In this DLC there are a lot of verity and the feel and the atmosphere feels amazing. There are also new pharaohs you can fight and also a new item called Chards of the Stars and these stones lets you fully upgrade your gear.


Photo Mode:

Finally, an Assassin’s Creed game that has an awesome photo mode which allows you to take beautiful photos from the beautiful Egypt itself.

Final Conclusion:

Pros:

+ Amazing loot system.
+ A great story.
+ Awesome architecture and environment .
+ Improved combat system.
+ Beautiful open world that feels alive.
+ Tombs to explore.
+ Trial of the Gods.
+ Egyptian Mythology.
+ Photo Mode.
+ Discovery Tour.

Cons:

- FPS drops within the release of the DLC’s.
- The length of The Hidden Ones DLC.
- Slightly annoying NPC’s.
- Aya’s sequences felt rushed.
- Can be a bit grindy at times.
- Few glitched achievements.
- All content does not include in the season pass.

I'll give this game a good 9/10 and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes RPG, Open World and Stealth games. This game really has everything a game should have, a great combat system, great gameplay, good side quests, an amazing story, a lot of content worth your time, a good main protagonist and an amazing open world. I think this game is worth the full price tag at 59,99 EUR and if you really want a game that you can play for while this game is for you.

Now that I have 100% the game and have more than 100 hours in it I feel I can write a final review of the game.

I will say now that if you are one of those people that thought Black Flag didn't really feel like an AC game then this game will probably also disappoint you.

Whist its a huge improvement over the last few AC games, and probably the best AC game since Black Flag, it still has problems, and one of them is very big. I will try to keep it as spoiler free as possible, but there is one point I may ruin that happens very early on in the story that I would not consider a spoiler but some people may, so be warned.

I will start with the good things.

-The open world is amazing, huge and fun to explore and has tones of interesting things to do

-The new side quest system is really good with over 100 unique side quests which makes the game feel more fleshed out, and the side content is actually fun for once instead of collecting chests and animus fragments from all over the map

-Almost no collectibles

-The new combat is really fun and much more challenging. Also makes stealth more meaningful

-Interesting main character

-Modern day is back, and whilst its still not as good as it used to its a huge step up over the last 4 games


Now the two small issues I have are:

-Very few historical characters. There is only really 3 major ones.
Cleopatra who is the main one, Caesar who is only in the end of the game, and Ptolemy who is only in 1 main cutscene. None of them are in the game enough and feel like wasted potential.

-Stealth feels more clunky than the last 2 games. You almost never use cover for stealth and social stealth has been removed. The animations are pretty clunky which really ruins the flow.


Now onto that major problem I mentioned.

Well it saddens me to say, but the story in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥. Seriously. I have never been this let down by a story in a video game in years, and AC games tend to have pretty good stories.


For those who don't yet know, last year Ubisoft announced a new plan of how to approach stories in their video games, going away from narrative storys and focusing more on the world and letting the player make their own storys in the world. To quote them "less storytelling and more players experience." Sadly this new approach may be the death of the franchise, atleast to me and many old AC fans.


The game starts of very messy with 3 different time periods, the main time period that you spend playing most of the game playing in, a flash back period 1 year before the main game where you find out about Bayek's Sons death (which is the main driving force for the story), and the modern day story. This jumping back and forth really confuses things and starts the game of badly. But it gets worse.

Every single assassination target in the game is completely forgettable. I finished the story 2 days ago and cannot remember a single one of their names, and only about 2 of their faces. Since this is a game about killing people, having villains that are so forgettable and giving you no real reason to hate them, except that one of them killed your son (who was only on screen for 5 mins in a flashback) is a really bad idea for a story and gives you no motivation.

The story telling also feels incredibly rushed, with most of your targets being assassinated in the very first mission they are introduced in, giving almost no character development and giving you no idea of what the are actually trying to achieve. The first assassination target is killed in the opening cut scene before you even start playing, the second target is killed in mission 2 and targets 3 and 4 are killed off screen so you don't even find out who they were.

There is another instance late in the story where you are told by one of the side characters that two of the people you were working with have betrayed you, just out of the blue. This is meant to be a major twist in the story, so why the ♥♥♥♥ did Ubisoft get some forgettable side character to just walk up and casually say "you have been betrayed". Non of the characters even seem to care, so why the ♥♥♥♥ would the player care.

To make it even worse, there are pretty much no interesting side characters, so the main story ends up getting carried by Bayek and his wife Aya's relationship, which is the only part of the story which is actually interesting in any meaningful way. Most of the side quests felt like they had more depth and story to them than the main story.

I hate to say this, but unless Ubisoft change their mind on story telling in their games then the AC franchise is dead. I'm sure it will continue to sell well, but the main reason core fans like me play these games is for the amazing story and lore that this franchise has, and sadly this game completely failed in that regard, and if the next game has a story as bad is this one then I'm afraid alot of the main fans may lose faith in the franchise.

I wish steam had a mixed rating since this is a really good game but the terrible story really lets the whole game down. I will give it a positive review for all the great improvements this game made, but if you are looking for a interesting narrative and emotional story go and buy one of the older AC games or the witcher 3 or something.

So. . . Assassins Creed Origins. There is some truth to the idea that if you've played one AC game, you've played all of them. This also extends to a certain degree to many other Ubisoft-published titles. They are vast open worlds with a plethora of mission content and objectives. You have a protagonist on a personal quest for revenge for some injustice done to him or her. Said protagonist is a parkour-performing serial killer with superhuman stamina and endurance. The series's most enduring mystery, whether it is "Assassin's Creed", "Assassins' Creed", or "Assassins Creed" is likely to never be answered to the satisfaction of many (okay, just me).

Origins is the somewhat-confusing tale of Bayek, a medjay (sort of an Egyptian sheriff) whose son was murdered by a cabal of conspirators who sought his assistance in opening a vault with, well, it's never terribly clear what was in it, but they figured that child-murder was a good way to get in it. Bayek didn't know how to get into the vault anyway, as is sometimes the way of these things, but he makes good his escape and begins a quest to hunt down the conspirators and forgive them. Just kidding. He wants to murder them.

My last AC game was Assassins Creed II, which I thought was really fun, but I ended up getting stuck on a story mission involving stealthily killing five or six different guys (yeah, the details are pretty fuzzy after all this time). I enjoyed most of the aspects of the gameplay, although the puzzle rooms were my least favorite. I think I'm too old for them--or maybe I never had the requisite patience to start with.

This entry in the series is purportedly intended to reveal the "origins" of the Assassins, hence the clever name. When you finish the game, you may have a vague idea about this, but there will remain things that are fairly unclear to you--unless it's just me and if you've played every AC game since ACII, you'd suddenly experience total enlightenment on this point. This is a possibility, but I feel confident that it is a remote one.

The game looks and sounds terrific. It's clear that Ubisoft Montreal put a massive amount of work into making period locations, details, and backgrounds as authentic as possible. If you don't believe me, check out the Discovery Tour mode. This mode is one of the things I was particularly excited about regarding the game. In it, you select a topic and an avatar from a range of the PCs and NPCs in the game and walk, ride, or punt your way through an area while hitting points of interest associated with behind-the-scenes information on creating the game world, real archaeological information, or real historical information about the setting, the people, and/or the place. It is a substantial amount of museum-tour-quality information at your fingertips, and Ubi sold it separately from the base game (there is no interactivity to speak of beyond the points of interest, so if you want to explore ancient Egypt without even being attacked by annoyed crocodiles, this is your ticket). It's quite good, but mostly what I've discovered is that, after putting approximately 119 hours into the base game and the DLC content, I don't really have the patience for it.

Bayek starts off with five targets to eliminate, one of which he does in the game's prologue. After finishing off the last target, he discovers that his conspiracy is more wide-ranging than he originally believed and gains a new set of targets. In addition to the main story missions, there are numerous side missions that appear in every region. They're not super-original or complex--they're fairly generic fetch, murder or rescue quests, but what they lack in quality they make up for in quantity. As in many modern open-world games, each region contains so much content that it's not difficult for you to "overlevel" the region. Ubi is aware of this and you have the option to have enemies scale to your level no matter what the default level is in the area; you also have the option to simply not do a lot of side missions that will give you so much experience that you overlevel the area. It really just depends on how you feel about the concept of enemy-scaling and content. I fall squarely in the camp of having more content rarely being a bad thing for a game (unless it's just a terrible game, which this is not).

When Bayek levels up he gains some health and damage and is able to unlock part of his prolific skill tree, with three areas of focus--melee combat, ranged combat, and "mystical abilities" (which include a lot of skills involving poisons, sleep toxins, and animal taming). These mean that you can play Bayek in a few different ways. My Bayek build was essentially a brutal combat machine who dealt serious damage with fast edged weapons. You can also rely on a lot of bow mechanics and sic animals on enemies and poison enemies with toxins that "infect" other enemies, leading to chain reactions of death. The variety of weapons available also makes for myriad tactical options (which you will need for some of the more challenging boss fights). For example, light bows fire a rapid succession of arrows, while predator bows have very low quantities of ammunition, but their charged shots can be devastating. Bayek can wield weapons ranging from daggers to several different types of straight and curved swords as well as large and small blunt weapons. Each of these can range from ordinary to rare to legendary in quality, with each step up granting more powerful bonuses (as one might expect). Weapons have levels, and it's possible to pay money to "level up" a weapon to bring it up to your current level, upgrading its stats. This way, if you have a favorite sword, you can ensure that it keeps up with you. Weapon types are, naturally, heavier and slower or lighter and faster, and these call for different strategies in handling single and multiple enemies in combat. All of this makes AC:O's combat system very rich and rewarding.

You will occasionally play as Bayek's semi-estranged wife, Aya, who is on a mission of her own to support Cleopatra's claim to the throne of Egypt against her brother Ptolemy. Her larger goal, of course, mirrors Bayek's, but she sees this as their best option moving forward--to gain powerful friends and ensure their ascendance. Aya's sections were not my favorites because he has a more limited set of abilities relative to her husband--and some of these sequences involve the game's dull and tedious naval combat. Yes, I get that some people like these sequences but I don't; I find them to be a jarring distraction from the elements of gameplay in the rest of the game. Naval combat involves awkwardly maneuvering your trireme to move around enemy vessels, launch fire arrow attacks, block enemy volleys, and avoid pitfalls like being rammed or running over Greek fire. One of these sequences is mandatory as part of the main story, another is part of an optional side mission, and another plays a role in one of the single-player DLCs.


There are some issues with the game. While it was remarkably stable in general, I did experience some crashes. Some of the game's quests require Bayek to use an ability called "Dawn & Dusk" that must be unlocked through the "seer" portion of the skill tree; this should have been an inherent ability. The framing-device story concerning Layla Hassan felt wholly unnecessary. Also the hints about aliens or gods or time-travellers meddling in mankind's development in the pyramids are bizarre and unexplained.

Having said those things, I have Odyssey in my backlog and am looking forward to firing it up in the near future.

I'll just say it, I love this game. If you've played Assassin's Creed games in the past, you pretty much know what to expect here. It's not doing anything we haven't seen in other games or pushing any boundaries, but it's a ton of fun and well worth your time and money.

Pros
+ Beautiful world set in a truly interesting setting (ancient Egypt). It's a joy to get lost in exploring. I've had many times where, on the way to a quest objective, I've run off to see what's going on over there and suddenly it's an hour later and I'm no closer to my quest objective.
+ Open-world stealth done well, though not quite up to the outstanding MGSV. I love assaulting forts, taking my time in picking off all the guards one by one. Using Senu (your pet hawk) to scout is a neat way to prepare your infiltration.
+ A TON of things to do. Side quests are (mostly) well-written, varied, and fun. The main story so far (I'm 20 hours into the game at the time of writing) is intriguing, and I'm excited to see where it leads.
+ RPG-lite mechanics. XP from kills, loot, ability points for new skills. Again, nothing too complex but it fits the game well.

Cons
- Overall it feels like they played it safe and went for accessibility over complexity. Like I said before, there's not much new here that we haven't seen.
- Melee combat can be clumsy. I appreciate that they went away from the Batman style to a more dodge and position based combat system, but it doesn't feel entirely... finished.
- Occasional graphics glitches. I had to restart the game once, and it went away.
- Uplay.

If you've enjoyed other Assassin's Creed games, and like the idea of exploring ancient Egypt, pick this game up.

Just finished the game and its dlcs, and i have to say, wow what a ride this has been! I was really sceptical in the beginning but after the first couple of hours the game really drew me in to it and captivated my interest for almost 70 hours of gameplay! This is a remarkable work by Ubisoft on the main game and the season pass. I really recommend you buy this one on gold edition and just enjoy one of the best games of 2017!

TL;DR: JUST BUY IT ALREADY!

[Edit: If you haven't bought this gem yet, you might aswell go for the new installment of the franchise, AC: Odyssey]

At last I came back to this series :)

'Assassin's Creed: Origins' is like a new and fresh start for the whole series. Huge map, amazing views, interesting characters, urge to make tons of screenshots.

If you lost your hope in Assassin's Creed series than you need to try Origins, it's making a difference :)

BCE

We got used to playing a new Assassin's Creed game always taking place later in our historical timeline. Origins changes the formula and puts us in Ancient Egypt (around 49-47 BCE, to be specific). It should also be noted that throughout the game I often felt like playing a Prince of Persia game - the last PoP (as in the last AAA game since just last year a mobile game hit mobile stores) was released back in 2010.

The title refers to how the assassins group came to be. It is an interesting story and we even get to see how exactly the good guys came up with the symbol. As usual, while the story is completely fictional it takes place in the "real" world which was recreated as realistically as possible and once again it is nice to see our hero team up with famous figures such as Caesar or Cleopatra.

Egyiptian Police Force

In other words, Bayek The Medjay. We control him who has this very special title. The Medjay were mercenaries, protectors who always looked at the interest of the pharaohs. He is not alone - Bayek often meets up with his wife, Aya. The story is a tale of revenge, intially: Bayek sets out to find and kill those capturing him. This event led to the death of his son, Khemu. These mysterious figures who hide in the shadows and fulfil various roles such as priest or scribe are actually part of the Order. They try to control Egypt by using their puppet, Ptolemy. We team up with Cleopatra who is in a somewhat exiled position.

AnvilNext 2.0

The same engine is used here after Unity and Syndicate and oh boy does Origin look tremendously beautiful. Especially when we ride our horses in the vast desert of Egypt. There's a rich fauna in this world including hyenas, vultures, hippos and even crocodiles. We often encounter mirages while travelling out there - if not attacked by a group of mercenaries. Oh, and our mount can, of course, be camels not just horses. Facial expressions of characters look better than ever and the water effect is the best we've seen so far in the series.

Senu

Forget the special coloration when pressing V. This has been a signature thing in the series, this time, however, we literally have an eagle vision. Senu is Bayek's pet who's constantly above him in the sky. With just the press of a button we quickly move up in the air so that we can use Senu to tag our enemies. Our pet can even harass some of the targets. Holding V can release a pulse which identifies those objects we can interact with. Most of them here are all jugs, baskets or other containers holding valuables. Chests require holding the E for a couple of secs. They are much smaller and forget the animation we had in Unity where our hero opened a huge chest full of all kinds of stuff. What we have here is more practical.

Revamped combat mechanics

The real deal. No counters this time. Fighting with more than one enemy is a challenge. You get killed many times. Bigger weapons are slower, hit harder but Bayek still wields them with one hand. The other is retained for the - mandatory - shield this time. You can pick up a defensive stance and you can counter with your shield if your timing is right. This always gives the opportunity to hit an enemy successfully.

Adrenaline is gained when fighting. This gives us the opportunity to unleash special attacks (these are weapon specific). Then we have bows, lots of them. One makes us become sharpshooters (very high zooming ability), another cannot be charged but can be fired quickly and the warrior bows can fire several arrows at the same time. There you go: your sniper rifle, machine gun and shotgun.

RPG

Lot of weapons are available with different colours. Blue is standard, rare items are purple and yellow weapons are legendary. We have come full circle - this Assassin's Creed game has become an RPG. If we get attached to a weapon very much mercenaries always level them up to match our level (for a price, of course). As for Bayek himself: level cap is 40 but additional skill points we can obtain by exploring tombs or finding other specific locations in Egypt. We have a lot of abilities to choose from and, in general, it can be stated that we can go towards 3 directions: one skill "tree" is melee oriented, another makes us an expert marksman and the 3rd is more about using gadgets and excelling at hunting predators. You do not need to pick one - all skills can be obtained but it requires a lot of skill points so you really have to explore everything if you wish to be the ultimate warrior.

Exploring Egypt

The map is huge. And I mean H.U.G.E.! We have tons of icons and most of the locations have location specific activities. Once these are completed (treasure found, captain killed, predator hunted down) a small tick will indicate this on the map - this system is very good and makes canvassing the map much easier when aiming for 100% completion. We do a lot of hunting, collect skins of animals and other materials to upgrade our armour, health and wrist blade damage. No more naval battles this time, but we can take control of merchants' boats and get on bigger ships to kills soldiers by, let's say, freeing some lions. Oh, and there are underwater scenes!!! Lots of treasures to find in the ruins of temples located in deep water.

Virtual Museum

Remember Shaun's database entries from the previous instalments? There were a lot of information but it was too much and stopped the immersion. Shaun's inserted one-liners and other jokes helped the situation a little bit but overall I always read many entries when I was done with a couple of memory sequences. In Origins forget the database. Instead there is a free roam game mod called Discovery Tour which allows us to roam the world without any conflicts and we can participate in tours where a narrator explains how bodies were mummified or what beer types the Egyptians made or how certain outposts were fortified. This is just brilliant - a lot of content with hours of audio with extra screenshots on paintings or objects that can be found in museums all around the world.

Résumé

Origins is an exceptionally good game, something that the series desperately needed. Bayek is still not Ezio but being a Medjay gives him a sort of by-the-book kind of guy feeling which made me lower my expectation. Plus, once again we can exit the Animus and get to meet Layla Hassan. Forget about the system of "initiates" and welcome Desmond's successor with open arms.

Assassin's Creed Origins
TLDR: This is a must play game and I highly recommend it due to it's level of detail, crazy number of quests and locations, great combat and progression!

I've finally 100% the game, done all quests, been to all locations, etc and feel like I can give an honest review of this game.

Origins is a lot different from all of the previous AC games, as this was the first in the series that Ubisoft changed up a little. Compared to the older games it has more combat ability and more to progress towards (upgrades, levels, skins, etc), however story-wise it is pretty similar. Here's some pro's and con's to the game!

Pro's
Playing through every location in the game just shows you the level of detail that went into making this game! From tombs, to camps, to castles, they are all amazing to explore if you are interested in Ancient Egypt.
The main story took me a while to complete, adding the DLC's and all the sidequests, exploring this full game has taken me a good 130+ hours. There is a crazy amount of content in this game to keep you entertained!
The combat in this game has improved SO MUCH compared to the previous AC games! You are no longer at a disadvantage if you are caught in the middle of an army of guards, stealth is only an option!
This game gives the player things to work towards. You'll find yourself too low level to take out a camp so you'll need to come back when you are stronger, this gives you a goal to work to which makes the game more interesting.
(Small pro but...)The soundtrack for this game, along with Odyssey is great and makes you feel immersed!

Con's
Like most Ubisoft games, this is quite badly optimised at times! Within a big city I was getting a lot of frame drops on Medium, after I upgraded my CPU I had very little issues on Medium but it is very CPU intensive in areas.
Some of the animations could use a little speed up as I feel Bayek is an old man sometimes with how slow he climbs.
The mounts are a little annoying, within a city they only run about as fast as Bayek runs. So sometimes it is quicker running to an area than using the mount.
Almost every enemy has a bow on hand, this is super annoying when you are trying to fight them and get annihilated with a volley of non-stop arrows


To Conclude!
This game is definitely worth a buy in my opinion! It is full of endless hours of fun and frustration, but after completing it you feel a sense of accomplishment and are more knowledgeable on the origins of the creed. Buy this game already, it is 100% worth the purchase!

Assassin's Creed Origins is the first Assassin's Creed game I've completed in a while (the last one being Black Flag). I picked it up recently during a sale and I must admit that my primary interest wasn't in playing through another of Ubisoft's entries in the unceasing franchise but rather in exploring a game world set in Classical Antiquity, a relatively untouched setting outside of tactics and strategy games. I wasn't particularly excited about the game in and of itself and, to be honest, my expectations were quite accurate. To begin with, the combat is a large departure from previous installments. It plays a lot more similarly to third-person action games like Dark Souls and while this makes for more interesting and intense large scale encounters, it comes across as a large departure from the traditional "Assassin" fantasy. Stealth is relegated to being largely optional in a similar vein to the many other open world games currently available on the market. The player is also stripped of much of their toolkit from previous Assassin's Creed games though this choice could be attributed to the game being first chronologically and you are given many new tools and abilities as compensation.

While the combat itself is certainly lighter and more fluid than ever before, I wouldn't go so far as to call it complex. The skill tree you're offered to choose from isn't especially interesting or innovative either, but it's definitely a step up. This leads me into another of my big complaints though, perhaps my biggest. The game, like many of its ilk, has an irritating tendency of taking agency away from the player. The amount of time your character's speed is arbitrarily limited for the sake of "immersion" had become infuriating by the time I was nearing the end of the game. Instances like being forced to move at a snail's pace while crouch-walking through a tunnel in a tomb when you can normally crouch-walk much quicker, or being made to literally walk while in the middle of an enemy encampment just because you're inside one of the few buildings. Having to watched the same finishing move you've seen a hundred times on an enemy while another enemy is just about to turn the corner and not being able to transition smoothly into picking up the corpse like some games have allowed you to do for a while now. When exiting one of the curtained hiding spots, the camera will flip around entirely to show the player doing their quick little animation when the only thing you should be looking at is whatever it is you're hiding from. The issue I take is that Ubisoft seems rather quick to discard sensible gameplay practices in favor of cinematic tricks which, while pretty to look at, tend to quickly grow cloying.

Another problem I would like to touch on is the parkour which has always been a staple of the series. As before the player can climb just about anything, it's getting down that tends to be the problem. It's not as bad as it has been in previous games, but in this instance the character seems to have a knack for getting stuck on ledges and railings where he should be able climb down quite easily. It's minor, but you'd think after a decade they'd have worked out the kinks a bit more thoroughly, though I suppose if it were that easy they'd have done it. But with all of the complaining out of the way, this leaves me with the main reason I decided to pick up this game in the first place, and allow me to be blunt; the world is gorgeous. If there's one thing the Assassin's Creed series has always got right it's set pieces, and this game is no exception. It's one thing to hear and read about the fabled streets of Alexandria, one of the most important cities in the classical world, but it's something else entirely to walk them. This is the most impressive display of Ptolemaic era Egypt I've ever seen and, to the extent of my knowledge, one of the most accurate. There isn't really too much else to say in that regard without sounding repetitive, so I'll just let the world speak for itself. In regards to what there actually is to do in that world, it's about what you'd expect from an open world Ubisoft game.

What you'll mostly find are small chests with crafting supplies and capturable outposts scattered around the map. Aside from the occasional maze-like tomb and side quest, much of the open world content is very par for the course. The main plot that takes you through this world is a rather cut and dry story of revenge following Bayek and his wife Aya. As far as interesting characters go, Bayek's certainly better than some we've gotten in the past, though I believe Edward and Ezio are still more enjoyable to play as. The story is servicable and I wouldn't say it does anything you wouldn't expect with it being the first game chronologically.
The only noticable bugs I encountered along the way were mostly audio (missing sound cues, one whole missing line of dialogue) and some janky lighting in certain underground areas. The game as a whole serves as an adequate entry into the franchise, and while I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone I know for more than $20 or $30, it certainly has it's merits. If anyone has a desire to explore the game world without the need of story or gameplay, a $20 version of the Discovery Tour exists as a standalone on Steam with audio guides and full access to the map. While the entire experience didn't blow me away, the game met my expectations and I look forward to seeing where they decide to take the next entry in the franchise.

This game makes every past AC game feel like beta testing. Granted: very expensive and lucrative beta testing, but still. This is the finished package.

Before I played this, I had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good.

So this installment is about as close to perfect as you could expect. With about 35 hours in the game so far, I personally believe this is the best of the series. The map is immense, the graphics stunning, and the story line is quite awesome. There are so many side quests, it's hard to decide which one to do next. I found the underwater swimming easier to navigate this time around as well as the character movement. In short, it is very hard for me to find a solid complaint about this game that would not sound like nit-picking.

Story :
Great story with amazing surroundings. Make sure you take your time to look around the map for scenic beauties. Some of the spot resembles actual places in egypt which are beautifully made. You spend a lot of your time roaming around in the desert initially, so better enjoy the scene. Also try to explore and visit different places in the map to enjoy the game rather than only doing the main missions and finish it. The game shows a bit of their tradition and culture inside the game which is great. I have seen many saying this not an assassins creed game and stuff, but honestly it does'nt matter, cause the story graphics, scenery etc makes it worth your while.

Game is really great. Its really worth your money and long enough story to keep you hooked in. Your money will be well spent. Now many will say its an offline game and crack is available, so why buy this game. My answer will be firstly for a safe download + you get back to the game whenever you want. If you are a fan of this series, its worth it, just pick it up on a sale and your wallet will be happy :D

This is the game we've all been waiting for, Assassin's creed origins! This game is going to say how this creed got made, we play as Bayek of Siwa, a medjy, i must say they made a very good and sexy Egypt, don't get bad thoughts that sexy was a metaphore (¬‿¬), literally better than Odyssey and Valhalla, don't waste your money on them, i really enjoyed this game and suggest you to buy it ;)

I was looking for an experience similar to the first Assassin's Creed game atmosphere-wise, and I wasn't disappointed.
The world sucks you in and is super fun to explore. Despite large chunks of the maps being desert, the terrain doesn't feel repetitive. The cities all have unique characteristics.

What I loved the most though were the characters. They have understandable motives and undergo lots of character development throughout the story. The main quest is very varied in themes and shows you around the map in a pretty linear way, which is neat. It also has a couple of moments that will absolutely rip your heart out. Raise your hand if you cried at least once o7
For history nerds there's a bunch of interesting characters incorporated in the story as well, and if you're not a history nerd, well, you will be after playing this game.

Game gets BONUS POINTS for letting Bayek pet cats that randomly gather around him.

Currently I am playing through all the titles in the AC series, because I want to understand the story behind it and see the progress that is done by Ubisoft from the very first to last games... Let us begin, shall we?

Even though this is not an AC game we're used to blah-blah... People around me were saying that this is the death of the series and I should play the first games, like AC1, AC2 (which is my favourite)... Don't get me wrong, I like the first titles, but frankly speaking the gameplay in the first one is boring as it can get (same in Mafia 3 *wink-wink*). Where was I? Ah, yes, I decided to give Origins a go.
I'm a fan of RPGs and Open-World-games, so this has already proved to be interesting for me. I logged into this game, not expecting much: first missions completed, galloping through picturesque landscapes, seeing pyramids in the distance, enjoying the immersive world with my trusty mount and bird. At some point I got so hooked, that had been playing for 6 hours straight.

In my opinion, Origins is a successor of the AC series, a bit from a different angle. If you're used to the old mambo-jumbo, I get it, but Ubisoft decided to add some new elements to the game, which I find positive.
I don't really want to write a long review, just leaving this here, so that you don't misjudge this game by only looking at its "cover".

Some things notable:
- Mechanics.
- Story (It is superior in comparison to some previous ones).
- Quests (They are unique, no repetitive stuff. Awesome, right?)
- Immersive world (If you ever wanted to slide down a pyramid, then why are you still here?)
- Tours (Has no impact on the game itself , but it is a nice bonus after finishing the game, where you can learn more about history, well-done!).

TL;DR: I rate this game Bayek (out) of Siwa.

This is a long overdue review.I got through Assassin’s Creed two years ago.Then over time I forgot to write a review of it.
I have played all the games in Assassin’s Creed series,and ACO can make the top 3. Assassin’s Creed Origins is the first part of the Assassin’s myth trilogy.ACO is a brand new innovation in this series, which added a level system to characters, weapons, equipment, etc,just like Odyssey and Valhalla.The difference is that I can’t be that willing to spend so much time in upgrading my equipment and weapons.However I was so addicted to spend that time in Origins.

You will become Layla (the modern world), enter the Animus, and return to the ancient Egyptian Bayek (ancient protagonist) to experience the assassin story of that old age. First, start from Siwa, step by step to uncover the black fog full of the map, and follow the main storyline to uncover the life experience of Bayek and the story of misery and sorrorw.
Origins provides a large number of ancient Egyptian landscapes, humanistic architecture, and customs and ideas: For example, a person must be physically complete to move freely on the reed plain and be accepted by Hades.
But I believe that when you play Origins for the first time, what immediately caught your attention was not the dark-skinned protagonist and his slightly sloppy beard, but the English pronunciation with a strong Egyptian accent.
Origins is still on the basis of land content, adding its wife’s perspective, including naval battle content, driving warship fire reviews, and broadening the "Assassin" combat system. In the middle of the game, you can outline the plot of the entire ancient Egypt under the action of Bayek and Aya from a two-line perspective.

This is a father's way of atonement.
From the day Camus died, Bayek's life changes from a comedy to a tragedy. As a father who is once "dereliction of duty", he constantly discovers the murderer of the year, and constantly assassinates the order defenders. He works hard to help every civilian get justice. But whenever he thinks that this revenge is over, he always finds that there are still people who should die. This seems to be no longer a simple revenge. And we don't know how far this road will continue. When Bayek and Camus’ souls finally bid farewell, he may or may not be able to let it go. Because he will remember Shadiya who was killed, and will choose to send the scared child home. I hope Bayek’s soul can reunite with Camus in Reed Field.

This is the understanding and love of a couple.
What Bayek is thinking is that after the revenge is over, he can return to a stable life with Aya. But in Aya's heart, she has already decided not to miss her feelings anymore. She choose to leave and chose a more ambitious career. Bayek lose his son and his wife. He loves Aya deeply, but he also knows that the two are destined not to stay together day and night, so he decides to let go. He let Aya pursue her will. Farewell by the sea, they will be on separate sides from now on. However, the understanding and love between the two of them did not end. Aya founded the early Brotherhood in Rome. Bayek trains new powers in Memphis, Ramonet’s name is passed down to future generations, and Bayek is lost in the sand. The two coffins are finally buried together, perhaps because of Aya's reluctance and love for Bayek.

This is the epic of the origin of the assassins.
Bayek has been the role of the guardian throughout his life and the role of the Avengers for a long time. He has never chosen so fiercely and firmly as Aya to resist the tyranny represented by the ancient orderers. Compared with Ramonet, he is not like an assassin at all, but it is precisely such a person who has left the mark of assassins from generation to generation. For this, I would like to understand this: no one is an assassin from the very beginning, walking in the dark and serving the light, everyone wants their own little happiness. However, after discovering countless times that this little happiness would also be broken, they finally awakens and begin to say goodbye to the light resolutely, hiding in the darkness. Bayek is always standing in the sun, his logo is the badge, and this story is exactly the beginning of the later generations of assassins standing in the shadows, so the assassins' logo is the mark of the badge-just like the shadow is the light Imprint. There is light and shadow. Bayek is not a standard assassin, but he is definitely a qualified and great assassin instructor.

Finally, pay tribute to Bayek of Siwa, and may your soul rest in peace.

Nothing is true.Everything is permitted.

I made it... Game Completion = 100%. Did every Mission / Side Mission, Every Achievement whatsoever. This Game is wonderful. TL;DR at the Bottom!

MY PC SPECS:

i7 7700k @ 4.2ghz
GTX 1070 EVGA SC
16GB DDR4 RAM
MSI Z270 GAMING PRO CARBON, Mainboard
Installed on an SSD with 256GB.

Runs Smooth at 80-100 FPS even on Citys with Settings Maxed out to Ultra on a 144hz Monitor @ 1080p

In Alexandria to around 70 FPS.

A game that is nothing short of a masterpiece, with new innovations and mechanics that make this a standout game in the franchise and arguably one of the best of the year. Without a doubt, the world is the most technically and graphically advanced of any open world game ever and that says a lot with Horizon Zero Dawn at one point having that title. Combat and skills work intuitively to carve a unique experience and leaves the choice with the player whether they want to be a jack of all trades or a stealthy assassin.

The story is incredible but has its fair share of flaws that I think could have made it even better but this series is definitely heading in the right direction. In terms of level design, it is no doubt that Ubisoft are masters of that aspect with what is a experience that mixes and matches that best elements of past franchises e.g. tree climbing, underwater exploration and even naval combat.

Ultimately this game is a standout in the series and definitely one of the best games of the last couple of years building on what was the previous two iterations of the series which were wholly disappointing. Nevertheless I think there is a room to improve in terms of the combat and skill tree which can be taken refined in the next instalment as well as developing on this new AC formula.

I know it probably sounds like im just a pure assassins creed fanboy, but im not really... I just like good video games especially rpg's, action games, and stealth. And this game is the perfect blend of all of them. In my opinion it is a masterpiece and a must play. A masterpiece in mechanics and gameplay set a in a world of beauty and intrigue. It doesn't get much better than this.

10/10 GOTY

TL;DR:

Pros:

+Great voice acting
+Excellent use of the ancient Egyptian setting
+Enjoyable new RPG focused combat / gameplay elements
+Memorable characters / engaging story
+Superb soundscape
+Superior graphics esp in ultra
+Excellent variety in missions with excellent side quests

Cons:
-Poorer gpu performance for AMD users
-DRM heats the CPU hard

The best thing about this game is the stunningly beautiful world the developers have created, probably my favourite open world I've ever played. Everything in this world feels like it was crafted with immense love for detail and history. Exploring tombs or just random ruins is really fun thanks to the amount of detail they've put in.The story in the game is not the best, but it makes you care about the characters and you can understand why they do what they do. It's a decent story overall, it just felt a bit short. If it had more buildup and a bigger ending, I think it would have helped it become better. One thing that is new with this game is the combat. In the beginning, it felt quite dull and I didn't really enjoy it, but after playing a few hours and testing different weapons I came to enjoy it. Not the best combat I've ever experienced but a lot of fun nonetheless. It also gives just tons of approaches and options to each quest, which made the side quest more diverse. Side questing, however, was mostly the same thing over and over.

Perhaps the "Best in Series" for Assassin's Creed, Origins takes on the role of explaining how the organization came into being.

While I'm a sucker for anything from Ancient Egypt, the development team went above and beyond for this gem. Visuals are stunning, and while gameplay and gear can sometimes feel grindy, it's never an unpleasant grind. Stealth mechanics feel good, and even open combat is satisfying despite all the dodging/blocking/parrying you may end up performing.

About to start my third (3rd) full playthrough since release, which should tell you something about the longevity the game has, and the enjoyment it provides.

READ ME!!!! IF YOU BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM MAKE SURE TO BUY ALL DLC'S ALSO FROM STEAM! PURCHASED THE DLC'S ON AWESOME SALE FROM UPLAY AND FOR SOME STRANGE REASON THEY ARE INCOMPATIBLE. YOU MUST EITHER PURCHASE ALL FROM STEAM OR FROM UPLAY, DO NOT MIX BOTH. there is no warning on either site about this but luckily i was able to get a refund since i literally had no way to play the content i purchased.

I enjoyed the game tremendously! Good enough story, probably a 5 or 6/10. Seems like they reached to try and keep it somewhat true to the other AC games. If you look at it from the perspective of a new game, you will have oodles of fun. Beautiful world, satisfying combat, stealth gameplay is subpar but still doable.

This game really surprised me.

I have to start this review by saying that I did pre-order this game and I have seen it in its raw state.
Also, I upgraded my specs while playing this game, so I can say a bunch about the performance on different levels.


First of all: The Story.

The story starts off simple: You are Bayak and your son got killed by some cult and you are out to get them. You are a Medjay; please don't ask me what exactly that is since it is only explained once in the beginning (I think, at least) and then never again.
You just hear people remind you that every chance they get.
But, you are out to seek revenge in those that murdered your son. Together with your wife Aya.
You experience this Story in the Animus, like it is common in AC games.

Speaking of Aya, a heads up: You do get to play as her in the Story as well, she even has her own little chapter if you find her DNA in the cave.
It's nice to change between two characters though, even if it only happens 2 or 3 times.

GamePlay:
Finally; finally you get to do what you want. The game narrates you for around an hour in the beginning, showing you some basic things, they differ a little from older AC games, but it's nice to have it. After that; boom, you are free.
At least a little. It took me 5 ingame hours of Main- & Sidequests to get the . And after that you set out to do your thing.
You could basically enter every single disctrict with the lowest level, you just won't get far. But you can.
Player freedom is insane in this game.
You do not get to choose who to kill (obviously, it's still a story) but you do get to decide a lot. Even if you want to show Mercy or not.(Once.)
One thing that really bothers me is the Parkour in this game. It's never regocnized to be something special, you can't understand the comments (unless you speak egyptian, I guess) and most people don't even react to it.
I love that in other AC games people would comment on it or be somewhat impressed.
Bayak can make jumps Ezio would be so damn proud of and he can basically climb anything. Even walls where I am pretty sure he is holding onto nothing.
At first this was really bothering me, but after some time you just accept it and it does get pretty useful to climb all kinds of pyramids or castle to infiltrate them whichever way you want to.

And to move on to the last part of the gameplay: Parkour is no longer the shortest or best way to get somewhere.
Despite the fact that you can climb anything, it won't do much. Cities are build in ways that you are mostly moving on the ground and actually executing parkour moves ends in you breaking your legs most of the time.
And using it as an escape is also no longer an option. Which is quite sad.

So I decided to play the game as stealth as I probably could.
And it pays off soooooo much.

It changed the entire game experience for me. Sneaking up on enemies, whistling to get their attention, tricking them with arrows, putting them to sleep or poisining them. It all works perfectly.
You can combine them, as well. Depends on how you want your character to work.

You can also go full Gladiator and only wear heavy blades, staffs and other heavy armor.
And before you ask: YES! you can fight in two arenas after you finished the mission on them. Side missions, I think.
And the Arena is a lot of fun, I am glad they implemented it. You can see your friends best rounds and beating them is actually a fun thing to do. Especially after you beat the game.

/EDIT: 24.01.2018:
I have played some more after finishing the story and have notice so many more incredible things. Like for example: If you shoot a normal arrow through fire, it will ignite and deal fire damage to enemies or implode barrels. Starting the just released DLC gives new levels, new gear and upgradeables.

Gear:
Oh boy. You can level your armor, pouches, arrows, by finding materials in the word. You can hunt animals for their trophies and materials or you can boycott enemies who transport materials. When people die they mostly drop loot as well. And almost anywhere in the world are container with loot in them. You can't miss it.
You can buy, sell and upgrade weapons and armor at Blacksmiths and buy new armor and clothes.
You can also buy new camels & horses from the Farmer in every city and sometimes even way outside one. It's pretty neat, let me tell you that.
Every weapon, armor and companion is leveled. Depending on the level, they have certain colors. Blue, Purple, Gold, etc.

Skills:
There are plenty, 3 of which you can level infinite amounts of times.. Those 3 are the end of every branch. Arrow, Sword and Tools.
You don't have to level them all to get to the end of the branches, in case there is stuff you don't need.
This adds to Player Freedom since you are not forced to buy random skills you don't want or need to get to other skills you may want. Plus points here, Ubisoft.

The world:
Oh lord. I am impressed. After I finished the game I still had 4 sections still completely unexplored, I didn't even step foot into it.
The world is huge. And there are many different places to visit, explore and just loot. There were times when I just took my trusty golden horse, took on my armor, rode through the desert and explored.
There is a photo-mode included into this game, that let's you take professional screenshots. This way you can see small little photo-icons on the world map of Photos other players took. You can also rate them.
This is a really amazing feature and sometimes even shows you what awaits you at a certain place.
/Edit: I finally managed to get three more sections explored and I am blown away.
But one section, a lonely desert, still creeps me out. You have Satly areas, full on deserts and greenland. Let me put it this way: You won't get bored.

But just riding through the desert, either fast or slow, looking how the sun goes down and the desert starts cooling off, you just relax. I always experienced the AC:Games to be kind of stressfull. You always gotta watch your back.
But not in this one. Sure, there are alot of insane moments and fights, but there are so many ways to escape all of this.
I really enjoyed just being free.

What is also nice to mention is your all-time companion. Your eagle. Senu.
You can take control of it and fly around the world freely. You can fly pretty far away from your character from what I have tested so far and he can help you spot enemies, loot and secret paths.
You can also skill him to distract enemies and everytime you do a leap of faith his perception gets increased. Neat.


Last but not least:
Performance.

On my old setup; AMD Fx 8320; 16GB DDR3 RAM it ran like crap. 20 frames on low in the city, up to 60 outside, but it stuttered.
New setup: AMD Ryzen 5 1600X; 16GB DDR4 3200;Mhz; same GPU as before: 70+ frames wherever I go, whatever I do, no matter how many corpses, AI, it doesn't matter. All on high-Very high.

Overall:

At first you need to be patient with the game. You need to let it grow on you, get used to its ways. But once you got the hidden blade (Took me 5 hours with sidequests), you are good to go. The game doesn't direct you anymore, it just watches you unfold & play. You have so muhc freedom to do what you want. There are no timers, no need to do this and that. You can take your time, get to know the world.
And even after you finished the game; it's all still there for you to explore. It's incredible.
Of course there are parts in this game that annoyed me (repetetive sea missions) but I can see over this for once.

The game is not perfect, but it is a lot of fun and after 40 hours I have finally finished it.
There is still so much for me to explore and do and I will.

If you want to play the origin story of Assassins' creed, with almost complete player freedom, here you go.
This is your chance. Take it.

I recommend it.

9/10.

Assassin's Creed: Origins is my 7th AC game, and is probably my favorite so far after AC Brotherhood. Origins has all the elements of a great videogame: Amazing graphics, good worldbuilding, interesting story, and fun gameplay. (Long post)

What I love about this game:
- BAYEK OF SIWA. He is such a strong character, and his VA Abubakar Salim did an amazing job in portraying him. . IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL JOURNEY. He's just so full of life, and you can see multiple sides of him as you go through the story: a protector of Egypt, a grieving father, a loving husband, a cold-blooded killer, a concerned citizen, a sassy mf (lol). He's such a multifaceted character, and I think he's my fave AC protagonist, along with Ezio.

- The parkour! You can climb everything ala Breath of the Wild!!! And it's so smooth! I had absolutely no trouble climbing anything, which is a surprise, since AC parkour has always been pretty wonky.

- The story was pretty good. Though most of it is because of Bayek.

- The world is beautiful, and it's an absolute treat to explore. I could roam around Egypt for HOURS. And I felt so immersed.

- The combat is much, MUCH better than any AC game I've played so far.

- YOU CAN FINALLY CROUCH. HALLELUJAH

What I didn't like about this game:
- The leveling system. In general, I'm not a huge fan of separating areas in an open-world game by level (i.e. you need to be a certain level to explore the area or you will die in one hit). I like when it feels organic, like in metroidvania type games where you need a certain item to get through it, or a softer approach where you just need better gear like in AC IV.

- The loot system. There were sooo many items and weapons that it sort of became a chore to sift through them.

- The empty desert areas. Like, why are they even there if you aren't going to put anything in them?? At least put in a few locations.

Overall, a really, really good game. And while it did sort of veer away from the traditional AC format, it's still pretty amazing.

i'm a Hidden One.
I've been constantly postponing playing the Assassin's Creed series for a long time. I'm finally here to share my thoughts on AC: Origins, the first AC game I've finished.

Assassin's Creed: Origins is an open-world action role-playing video game, the 10th installment of the AC series. The story is set in Ancient Egypt during the Ptolemaic Period and deals with the origin of the assassin-templar conflict with the assassin faith. The game processes the story of Bayek, the first Assassin, a former Medjay who fought to protect his people from dangers.

-- In addition to what I said above, I can say that although I haven't played the series fully, I know that the AC series has always taken real events as its starting point. And this time, we witness the spread of Rome's Republic-Monarchy conflict to Ancient Egypt. Cleopatra was removed from the throne she claimed, and her brother Ptolemy ascended the throne. Cleopatra, who defended that Ptolemy was a puppet, also declared war for the pharaohship. At this point, Cleopatra will not hesitate to take advantage of even Rome's civil war. It is right in the middle of this turmoil that we are Bayek of Siwa chasing his own revenge story. --

it's hard to be a medjay, but it's harder to be Cleopatra's medjay.

While Bayek is normally expected to be a character who always frowns and sprints along the path of revenge due to his own story, he was created as a character who can find pleasure in the small details of life and has a sense of humor. That's why Bayek of Siwa took his place in the list of my favorite characters in my game life.

Let me tell you about the innovation in the AC series that comes with this game. Unlike previous games in the series, AC: Origins stands out for its role-playing innovation. The game has the must-have features of role-playing games such as a level system, ability system, and item system. It's just not that. There is also a crafting system. By collecting certain resources, you can improve your hidden blade, quiver, armor, and many other features. Also, if your level has increased and the weapon you like is no longer powerful, don't worry, because you can improve your weapon to the same level as you by going to a blacksmith. Here are all these and many other innovations that show us that AC: Origins has taken on the character of a role-playing game.

holaa!

Let me also tell you a little about the new combat system. Because I've never really enjoyed fighting so much before. :) In the new combat system, we can no longer counterattack with a single button and knock down the enemy with a single movement. Especially if our enemy is strong, we also need to actively use important movements such as dodging attacks and avoiding attacks. This also increases the enjoyment of the game.

Assassin's Creed Origins has a seriously huge map. The fact that the world is so vast offers us many places to explore. A new place we can explore may contain a new task, item, resource, or something new related to the story. In addition, the fact that small puzzles have been added to the game is also one of the great features. I have completed all the main missions, side missions, events, and question marks in the game in 100+ hours. I have enjoyed every hour of these 100+ hours. The graphics, in a word, look amazing. The specific mood of ancient Egypt is reflected very nicely. The in-game animations are also beautifully crafted. Although artificial intelligence is not perfect, it can perform much more logical movements than old games.(after a certain level of difficulty)

With all this told, I really liked AC: Origins. I had a satisfying gameplay experience with almost non-repetitive missions on such a huge map. I did my best and as much as I believed it was stupid to take revenge, I did my duty. Now I can say that i'm fine with this, i'm not a father anymore, i'm not a husband, i'm not a Medjay. i'm a Hidden One.

"i'm fine with this, i'm not a father anymore, i'm not a husband, i'm not a Medjay. i'm a Hidden One."

Before u play the game, know that Assassin's Creed standard playstyle that we are familiar to has changed with Origins, so its not a typical stealth game. There is a good range of weapon choices (not lots of, but enough) and weapons have some overpower option which creates variety during the fight (i hate monoton combat systems in games generally), the map is pretty big (80 square kilometer) compared to its ancestors (except black flag, if am not wrong), only thing that makes game a bit boring sometimes is that u must do lots of side quests to progress in the main story because ur level should at most be 2 or 3 lower than mission's level otherwise u probably would be dead with one shot, but if u like grinding and spending time in an open world where views and locations in ancient egypt is wonderfull in a nutshell (thats what makes me keep playing most of the time), then thats not gonna bother. Consequently, i do recommend the game 8/10.

Spectacular, exceptional, attractive.. Graphics, gameplay, details or whatever you may seek from an AAA game are all nearly perfect.

I very very STRONGLY recommend playing pretty slow with a good gamepad and nightmare difficulty.

I haven't played Odyssey yet, I will play it after I %100 Finish Assassin's Creed Origins ( I finished the story and 2 DLC's). But I can tell that this game is the best Assassin's Creed game I've ever played. The Graphics and Ambiance are awesome, Egypt is too realistic, Pyramids and the tombs that awaits to be found... Looting, swords, bows, outfits, some very cool horses ( abyssal steed mount is my favourite), outposts, main and side missions ( Bayek's promise is my favourite) , Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, boss fights (The Curse of The Pharaohs has very strong boss fights especially if you are playing on the hard mode ) , our eagle Senu, our son Khemu ( which means Egypt) and especially the Story with DLC's ( The Hidden Ones was 10/10 for a DLC and The Curse of The Pharaohs was 7/10 )
Everything I say and forget to say was just awesome.
Perfect game.
Again, the best Assassin's Creed game Ever! In fact, one of the greatest games I've ever played...
Highly recommend it with 10/10




Update= I finished Assassin's Creed Origins with %100 Achievements and I played Assassin's Creed Odyssey and both story wise or general, Assassin's Creed Origins
is better. Assassin's Creed Odyssey is not bad at all, but the real Assassin game ( which includes Assassins ) is Assassin's Creed Origins, in every aspects.


So still Assassin's Creed Origins is the best Assassin's Creed game Ever ( GOAT ).
And still 10/10.

I said earlier this month that odyssey was the best purchase I made in 2020, turns out that was a lie as this game replaced it, even though it's older by a couple years.

Somehow Odyssey feels very hollow in comparison to origins. Yes the graphics are better, but it doesn't matter because the level design is less engaging and beautiful. Yes it has more content, but it's also much more grindy, padded and boring.

Overall origins is just a much better game.

That doesn't mean it doesn't have it's quirks. The main problem I have with this game is just the sheer amount of time wasted on forced walking slowly behind someone during the seemingly infinite escort quests.

That said, this game has worse graphics and managed to be far more visually appealing. It plays better, scales better, is less grindy, more fun, better story, better voice acting, better pacing, better engagement and just in general is pretty great in most things.

That said just because it's better than another Assassin's Creed game, don't expect the writing to be life changing and brilliant, but it is comparatively, at least pretty good.

I'm not sure why i let this fly under the radar so long, but if you're thinking of picking it up on sale, definitely do so, it's worth a play and not just that but it's pretty enjoyable.

If anything the Odyssey while I enjoyed it at the time, is substantially worse than this game. There are a few things it does better: Deffault keybinds are better and make more sense. The graphics are better at facial animations. That's about it really, and those really aren't big things. If anything Odyssey looks and feels rushed by comparison to Origins. I strongly recommend this one over that, and also just in general this game is pretty fun. Having tried valhalla yet but I'll look at it when the DLC is out and it's bundled.

This is the first Assassin’s Creed game I’ve liked since Assassin’s Creed 2. The new and modernized combat system is the star of the show. For the first time in an Assassin’s Creed game, I feel like I have control over how my character behaves in battle. Makes the game a hell of a lot more fun to play, especially when you get caught!

Happy Ubisoft decided to include Steam achievements. Say what you want about achievements, but they add another layer of fun to a game for me. Ubisoft withholds this feature from quite a few of their titles. And STOP. No one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about, or wants to use Uplay. Far Cry 5 not fully supporting Steam made it a very low priority for me. I’ll pick it up at a deep discount if at all.

Back to the review. It’s safe to buy an Assassin’s Creed game again. This game excels in every area — especially graphics and gameplay! Go buy it! It’s the best Assassin’s Creed game imo.

Take many features from the Witcher 3, add Rise son of rome combat style, fill with all the classic AC stuff and serve on a gigantic and marvelous depiction of classic Egypt. This game had it all to be a masterpiece, and it's extremely enjoyable, but side quests are repetitive, there are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of forts all identical, those crocodile nests everywhere.. I appreciate the world they made, but it's not comparable with the depth of the Witcher quests, or the sense or continuos surprise you have there.. Here the stoy is quite simple and encounters are too similar to the other. I certainly recommend the game, but whey could have put some more fantasies in the small quests, the vastity and quality of the world would have deserved it.

Wow, what an impressive game. For me it's superb.
It represents perfectly the ancient world, a mix between GTA V and Tomb Raider.

Pros:
- A huge map with each unique locations
- Beautiful graphics and wonderful enviroment
- Arrow control
- Hawk vison
- Interesting and varied side missions
- Automatic riding option
- Easy travel through the world (few time going to one place to another, even walking)
- So many things to do and explore that you'll be a lot of time playing it
- Not too hard to get 100% achievements
- A photo mode to take the beautiful screenshot

Cons:
- A bit of bugs such as swimming in the air
- Microtransaction (costumes, weapons, mounts, etc...)
- Lock on system in the combat system is really weird and not good at all

I'm going through my entire library and putting a minimum of an hour into each game and then reviewing them, here is mine for Assassin's Creed Origins:

So I am not done with this game, but I really love the direction they've taken it so far. I've just been playing and doing other things lately so I haven't come back to it yet. But its still installed and will stay that way until I beat it.

The story is fine. You'll get to meet some interesting character. The side quest is meh at best. My complain is the "saving" quests requires you to carry people and after you reach the checkpoint, their legs magically heals. (Like wtf you can walk all this time?) Annoys me but tolerable.

The world is beautiful and build with love by the dev. It was fascinating to see how Ancient Egypt might looks like. The world is very alive. Ohh and get yourself the Gold Edition, the DLC's are better than the game and it give a sense of closure

Tl;dR, Great game. It's worth the full price and a steal during sales.

TL;DR -- This game has LOTS of bells and whistles (open world size/depth, graphical prowess) and lots of polish, but the core mechanics (fighting, climbing, and stealth) are actually a step back from Syndicate.

Detail --I have a really hard time choosing between the "Yes" and "No" answer to whether I recommend this game. There are some things it does so well that it's just a joy to play; the environments are stunningly well-crafted and the graphics are gorgeous. But there are also some features it's either completely missing or does so poorly it leaves me wanting to bang my head against the wall because they detract from what could have been such a better game. It also runs very shakily, with regular, ugly frame drops.

If you adore the series like me, then go ahead and pick this up. You'll get enough out of it to make it worth a purchase (as I feel I did). But if you're not a fan then skip Origins unless you love Egyptian history. This game won't convert you. And I'd go even further to say that if you're lukewarm on the series, you probably want to skip this, too. All it really does well is open world and soundtrack. So unless one of those two are something you love in a game, you're probably not going to like Origins enough to spend $60 on it.

I'm pretty stunned that there are a number of things this game actually does worse than its predecessor, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, which is a game that many consider to be one of the poorer entries in the series.

For starters, free climbing is an absolute mess in Assassin's Creed Origins. The reinvention they worked so hard on in Unity with the Free Climb Up and Free Climb Down buttons, and the perfection of that system into what I consider the smoothest free climbing in the series in Syndicate is completely gone from Origins, which instead has reverted to the absolutely terrible "One Button to Free Climb" system that birthed the frustrating moments of the worst game in the series (in my opinion), Assassin's Creed III. Get ready to randomly jump off walls into the middle of 8 enemies in a courtyard when you're trying to stealth, or to begin climbing up the wall next to you when you're just trying to reposition yourself in the middle of a fight. In addition to this, what you can climb is not really indicated visually anymore. Some buildings have clear grooves that are not usable as handles, and there are statues that have no handholds whatsoever that are easily scaleable. Some spaces seem to far to jump but you can with ease, others seem clearly in reach but are not. It's completely arbitrary and leaves you feeling railroaded.

In addition to the poor free climbing, combat is an cluster♥♥♥♥. Ubi has swiped Witcher 3's combat system without shame, except the smoothness of that game is completely gone, leaving you janky, unnatural, strangely timed animations, and dodges that happen inhumanly fast yet still get you hit by enemies because the hitboxes are so inaccurate. And you have no Signs or potions to deepen the experience. It feels weird, it looks bad, and it's shallow. It's not fun. I played through Witcher 3 on Death March and had a lot of fun, so it's not that I'm bad at video games. Origins saw me turn the difficulty to Easy almost immediately so I could just button mash and blast through the enemies and avoid the combat almost completely.

The stealth is not as good as Syndicate, which made great improvements such as using cover and specific designs in the environment to your advantage. It's not even as good as the stealthy side missions (saving child workers, etc) in Syndicate. It's the same stealth gameplay from Black Flag, which was fine... 4 years ago. Really disappointing if you love the stealth genre like I do and were happy with the improvements from Syndicate.

Another puzzling design choice is the complete removal of the Codex and the historical info blurbs that pop up as you're free roaming. One of my favorite things to do in an AC game is to free roam, hitting map markers, while reading the historical blurbs that pop up to provide improtant context. It's absurd that Ubi would completely remove them from this game for the first time. I'm a layman to Egyptian history and they could have provided some great context to some of these characters. It's great knowing that they're based on real, historical people who actually lived. That context is completely gone and the majority of these characters I'm meeting are way too thinly written without it. They're dry as paper and may as well be scarecrows with costumes. The story is mediocre in general. It's a generic revenge tale with some oddly inconsistent tone (Bayek seems awfully cheerful for having a young son who was brutally murdered less than a year ago) and peppered with some awful voice acting. Bayek and Aya's performers are great, but Layla's is awful, and a lot of the minor characters are inexcusably bad, too.

Okay so I'm kind of crapping all over the game here, but it does still do some things amazingly well. The addition of RPG elements, including ranked loot, really help push you towards exploring, too. At its best, Origins will keep you up all night hitting question marks on the map, levelling your character, getting new loot, and generally just progressing and clearing the map. The open world is spellbinding. There's such a variety in terrain -- desert, arid mountains, oases, cities, woods, etc -- That you never get tired of simply hopping on your camel or horse and exploring. There's verticality, water to dive in, tombs to raid, and caves to spelunk. And the variety in cities is excellent as well. Gone are the samey cities from past games, and back is the huge variance in cities such as between Florence and Venice in II. The Greek architecture of Alexandria, the old Egyptian setting of Memphis, and the varied small oasis towns and camps in between them keep everything fresh and you never feel tired of exploring. There was a point for about 50 hours when I was just free roaming, having a blast experiencing these great environments, and I seriously considered changing this review to positive. But roaming an open world can't carry a game by itself. So I eventually grew bored of hitting points of interest and continued Origins' story missions only to be forced into bad mission design, bad combat, badly designed stealth segments, and bad plot writing, and began hating this game all over again. A lot of this game reminds me of Assassin's Creed III, with all its poor mission design and bad story.

To be concise, the problem is that too often the great stuff in Origins is broken up by one of the negatives I mentioned earlier. I'll stealth through two or three bandit camps, hit points of interest, gain levels and hunt loot while progressing my character, taking in the quiet moments and enjoying the great soundtrack... Then I'll run into a free climbing snafu, or get bogged down in its clunky combat for 10 minutes, or play some drearily designed story mission that kills any desire to keep playing.

Despite all my hours logged, I still haven't finished the game. I've cleared most of the map icons from free roaming, but the story, combat, stealth, and general mission design failed to engage me to such an extent that I have no desire to actually complete the game. I've already gotten what I wanted out of it: A great open world experience that I can take in at my own leisure. It's unfortunate that so much other frustration got in the way. And because of that I can't honestly recommend this game to any but the most hardcore Assassin's Creed fans. So I've got to check the "No", despite my inner Assassin's Creed fanboy wanting to click "Yes".

My series ranking: Origins is nowhere near as good as II, Brotherhood, or Black Flag, but still a more enjoyable experience than the putridly awful III and the below average Unity.

Origins is way better than Odyssey. Game has better main character who isn't blank, quests are more interesting. Egypt and atmosphere are stunning. Odyssey isn't bad game but this game took everything from Origins and made it even worse except combat. I played Odyssey first before Origins.

Bayek is a cinnamon roll. You can't change my mind.

This was my first Assassin's Creed game. I played a lot on PS4, but it was so enjoyable to me that it was worth the purchase for Steam.

Origins has a lot of pluses, and only 2 downsides.

Pros:
1) Enjoyable loot system. Even bad loot is good as it can be broken down into parts immediately, and gives a lot of parts when you do to later upgrade Bayek.
2) Combat offers many paths while not absolutely forcing you to do anything. Would trinkets help as opposed to direct combat sometimes? Yes. Do bows do OP damage but a stealth approach would be better for avoiding detection? Yes. Is melee smashing the most satisfying? You bet your ass. But are you ever forced to do any one path? Nope. You can finish any mission any way you want, even if certain strats would be better.
3) You actually get bonuses for unlocking locations. Senu can detect objectives and people a lot quicker and at much farther range once you've unlocked a fair amount of locations.

The cons:
1) Bayek's wife Aya is not developed well at all. The player is constantly told by NPCs that she's strong and venerable, but really all you see is her going down the path of bloody vengeance that everyone warns Bayek not to do. In essence, she gets praised by NPCs for doing things off-screen that those same NPCs warn Bayek not to do. This could easily be overlooked if it were in a supporting character, but considering Aya is the main character's wife, and you're forced to play as her in a few places, she just ends up feeling like a really unnecessary burden that the player is always forced to remember right about when they would otherwise forget she exists.
2) The present day story line is so disconnected and unnecessary. The game is really fun and even exciting to play in the Egypt storyline, but every time I'm forced to go back to the present day it feels forced. The game is trying to serve the present-day story line as opposed to having the present-day story line serve the overall game.

Thank you for your time.

I can't get over how Odyssey is higher rated then this game so I decided to say so officially, I LOVE Valhalla but the setting of Origins and the sheer beauty of the world and the rich history of the land and the cultures and history of the land appeal to me more than Valhalla ever could. The fact that you are using a boat far less than the other two titles also appeals to me I must say along with the more varied mounts including camels.

The biggest con in my opinion is the talent tree, I never noticed a way to reset the talents and the tree is inferior to the next titles and the way gear upgrades is handled I consider to be superior to Odyssey but not nearly as nice as Valhalla's. It is easier to keep up with your equipment in this game then in the next title, Valhalla doen't have levels, just a power rating which =s the number of talent points spent which does not affect how up to date your gear is since there ARE no levels.

Maybe I am doing too much comparing and what not but the story and landscape are rich and the history quite accurate as far as I can tel, I just wish horses could swim in this so you don't have to find river crossings which is annoying and unrealistic considering the horses of the era were not that heavy compared to modern horses.

8.8 out of 10 in my opinion, I hope you get the game and enjoy it as much as I have or even more. I will say that I consider the DLC to be worth it.

Assassin's Creed Comeback!

A lot new things applied to this game
Just imagine Assassin's Creed combine with Withcer 3, Watch dogs 2, Black flags, Tomb raider, Dark soul, Far cry, and etc.

Pros
+ Huge world Map
+ Variative Weapons
+ RPG system (some people did not like it)
+ Beautiful world, every city is different from the others
+ Love the Side Mission, every side mission have diff story but at the end we just doin same job

Cons
- Main Story is really really standard (Cleopatra n J.Caesar Story really help it)
- Hit Combo attack not much variation
- Suck Assassinate animation
- Can not run sprint, horse / camel can not sprint too (we need wait a sec to get full speed)

Worth to buy? Yes from me
I think Ubisoft need stop this AC series, it's enough! make this the last one.
Even there is a lot demand with this game series wait till 3 or 5 years again with new fresh idea.

I give Assassin's Creed® Origins: 8.8/10

Minor Spoilers: One of the oldest yet best story driven game franchises within the gaming industry. A great franchise with a huge influence over other games and with an original story driven setting; Assassins creed. After the launch and huge success of ACII the game has had a lot of successful title releases however, in recent years Assassin's Creed failed to show gamers that their franchise is still the best story driven series within the respected genre. That is until Assassin's Creed Origins drops and it is insanely good. It almost brings the vibes from what you felt in ACII.

Personally, one of my favourite gaming franchises a long with other several Rockstar and Bethesda games. I can't play single player games since they bore me however, with Assassin's Creed I can always make time for. Assassin's Creed Origins deserves a top 3 in my favourite AC games.

Pros

Graphics: Graphics in this game is mind blowing. Personally, I think Origins has the best graphics as of now. Everything is beautifully detailed. From the stormy sandstorms, to the calm swaps of the Nile. Everything looks so calm and soothing that I take my time to stop and take a screenshot here and there and upload it to the Ubisoft Club.

Immersion: Origins is very immersive. To level up, you don't follow a main quest after main quest but you are forced to level by doing side quests or other various activities. This game is insanely immersive and my reason for this is NPCs have their own minds. They eat, sleep, guard, talk etc. You can wait until night to assassinate people which is easier since there are fewer guards awake and more sleeping. Animals sleep too! The landscape shape shifts around such as spreading oil and dead body's using water tides or the weapons sinking in the sand. This game has so many features of immersion that I simply couldn't list all.

Story: We follow Bayek of Siwa as he ventures through Egypt to find the killer of his son. The story slowly shows us how the creed of Assassins is formed. I try my best not to give to many spoilers but besides that, there are several intriguing side quests with their own interesting story. We learn a lot about the Egyptian gods through the story and side quests and how each god influences the people.

Soundtrack: The soundtrack is simply beautiful. It brings that unique ACII soundtrack with a version of its own using Egyptian soundtrack. I don't think their was any soundtrack in Origins that made me think "What is this?" but instead it make me think "This is really good".

Gameplay: This game provides tons and tons of hours of gameplay. Don't be thrown of by the 25 average completion hour rate. People that completed it within 25 hours probably had the game on the easy difficulty (yes there are difficulties now). This game provides an insane amount with many activities to participate in such as gladiator fights, tomb raiding etc. There is always something to do in Origins, even if it's something simple such as upgrading your gear.

Historical Figures: This game is set around the end of the Egyptian kingdom so it features the historical figures such as Cleopatra and Julius Ceaser. This isn't one of those one scene cameo appearances but full on dialogues with each historical figures. I find this very interesting since people who love history would love this kind of stuff.

Diverse Gear: The gear that you have can be customised to your liking. You can have your own style of play depending on the gear you have and the abilities that you have picked. I find this as a strong point because everyone would want to play their own way and are not forced to play the game wants them to play.

Enemy Scaling and Combat: I know some people may not like the whole NPC enemy levels but trust me, this is a huge leap for the AC franchise. Enemy leveling provides a huge challenge if you are underleveled. As fun as the old combat system was where you'd counter attack and do that without getting hit for once, that doesn't happen in Origins. You have to think what your next moves are going to be and how you approach things which requires more tactics.

Cons

Performance: It wouldn't be Assassin's Creed without a few bugs on release. Do expected bugs within Origins but they aren't hugely game changing. Sometimes you don't notice them but I wouldn't blame someone if it killed their immersion because of it. Regardless of that, this game runs very smoothly at high graphics.

Parkour: A minor change I would ask is for the parkour to be improved. I've had more deaths due to Bayek jumping off where I wasn't facing or losing a lot of health because of it. I do find this frustrating but I dealt with it since it didn't happen always.

Cut scenes: Yet again, this isn't a huge con but some cut scenes felt really bland and boring to me. Like the CG for the face wasn't done right or something, especially the cut scenes in slow motion. But like I said, it's not all cut scenes that had this problem, only the very few.

I hope you enjoyed my quick review of Assassin's Creed® Origins. I highly recommend getting this game as Ubisoft did a great job reviving the series after a few recent flops. This game is very addicted and immersive. It gives an insane insight to how the creed was formed and how Egyptian life was as well a bit of the Roman and greek life within Egypt. It teaches you more than what you history teacher could ever teach you. You will come out with more knowledge as well as hours of gameplay. I can't wait for the next game for the series.

Assassin's Creed Origins is the 1st game in the AC series to go all in on the RPG elements, and I have to say, they succeed in doing so as this change was needed to reboot the series and make it fresh and exciting yet again.

TLDR: This game is a solid 9/10 (base game) and is definitely worth the try if you're an open world/RPG fan. Both the DLCs are also amazing and totally worth it thus the Hidden Ones gets a 8.2/10 and the Curse of the Pharoahs is 8.5/10.

Now for the Pros- The setting of the game being Ptolemic Egypt is a huge win, the place is soo beautiful, wonderfully designed and detailed, and almost serves as a mysterious place and we don't know anything about. This was also the first time AC went extremely in the past and I'd say it helps with the *change* they were going for. The soundtrack too adds to that mysterious feeling as you don't know what to expect. The story of the game is really good, it serves well overall for Bayek although its more of just a revenge story so... Talking about Bayek, he is an amazing protagonist, definitely my favorite of the series after Ezio, the voice acting is really well done and the motion capture is pretty good. Now talking about the world, the side quests here are amazingly well written, each side quest has a proper story attached to it and it feels natural for our character who is a *Medjay* or a police type figure that helps people, these side quests just add to the immersion. Also I have to recommend everyone who's looking to pick up this game to try the Discovery Tour prior to starting the game as this tour is really well detailed and they explain how the whole world was designed and the historical significance of each and every thing that the developers added to this game, so that when you play the game, you'll feel the world to be a lot more alive instead of being a backdrop to your story. The new combat system is also really well done, and i was soo happy Ubisoft got rid of the counter attack styled combat as it was extremely boring, this newer combat system is a lot more engaging, you have different weapon types, each with pros and cons to suit your playstyle, same for the different bows and tools that are available for us to use. The weapons have a weight to them and the enemies don't feel like damage sponges and I wish they keep it that way (*cough Odyssey cough*) The boss fights are also nicely done especially the one with that big snake and the weekly trials of anubis. The gladiator arena, the war elephants and the hippodrome races are also nice additions and are there for all those who'd enjoy them. The naval missions are also great and extremely fun.

Now for the Cons- There are microtransactions, which although aren't forced at you but are an ugly site for any AAA title. Next is that even though the combat is nice, it can get old quickly. The stealth in this game is also not necessary as the combat is a lot quicker and easier. The lip sync is really weird and it really isn't up to the mark for a huge company like Ubisoft. The also doesn't have any social stealth, in the Discovery Tour however you can interact with the environment and it would have been soo cool to include it in the base game for some stealth kills. Now the game has well made cutscenes overall but most of the times it'll be like a free camera in which both the character and the npc just kinda talk, which was okayish and not as good as I'd have wanted.

Now for the Hidden Ones DLC- This continues the story of the brotherhood 4 years after the main game ends, we get a new area to explore in the form of Sinai, it is slightly different to the main game but its kinda more of the same, the story here is really well written and all the side quests only enhance the experience, a very short and sweet content and was enjoyable overall.

Now for The Curse of the Pharoahs DLC- This DLC is awesome, it introduces a new area to explore with 4 afterlife regions which are really well designed, there are new boss fights as well and the story is great too. Its a really good expansion overall and definitely worth it

I'll keep this brief. This game's pretty much focusing on being an RPG and it definitely works. They "borrowed" a surprising amount of mechanics from The Witcher 3 and even more shockingly, some things are just flat out done better.

The world's better in my eyes. Not because it's more varied or even more exciting, but just by making actual sense. No longer do you have small areas that somehow have famines while having rich areas just 3 minutes away. You don't just have insane cultural shifts in the world within minutes of each other. While I liked The Witcher 3's world, it was also very nonsensical. I was worried Origins would be all about deserts, but you'll see a lot of lush vegetation, swamps, sandy deserts, rocky deserts, inhospitable wastelands and so on.

The side quests are also much more interesting. The Witcher 3 already had great side quests and I think Origins managed to take their ideas and expand on them. Quests that are tied into the world much more strongly are commonplace and while mechanically they can boil down to a series of objectives, it's something I think we should be expecting anyways. An action game will have action. Yeah, there's been a lot of action already, but that's what you're here for.

Graphically the game's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gorgeous. Occasionally I have games that make me "ooh" and "aah" on a regular basis and this was one of them. Seeing the pyramids of Giza in their full glory was just amazing. Same goes with the background vistas, all of which felt reachable, yet impossibly far at the same time. Just absolutely top notch stuff.

The gameplay loop is what you'd expect though. Clearing out areas, side quests, looting, killing. If you liked clearing out areas in The Witcher 3, then you should be fine with this. If anything, occasionally you'll be having more interesting stuff here than in The Witcher.

There's just one problem in the game... and it's big for me. There's a level cap of 55 when you have the Gold Edition and 40 if you're on the regular version. This takes away the extrinsic motivation from the player during the last DLC, which already suffers from the "lost potential and too generic" syndrome. So because of that my last 5 hours in the game were just boring and unexciting. I am a person who loves overlevelling and overpreparing and the game just doesn't allow for it and that's more than disappointing to me.

Also, check out the Discovery Tour. If you like easy to digest pop history, then this is for you. It's a great addition with a surprising amount of effort having been put into it. I just hope Odyssey has a similar mode with even more put into it.

I personally don't regret getting the Gold Edition, but it's definitely neutered simply through the awful level cap, which kills a good portion of the excitement and fun in RPG games.

AC: O is reportedly last AC game about assassins. It's also a game with the most RPG elements in the series and and it's amazing. Here's why:

Gameplay
The most important factor in this game. It's very enjoyable. Movement is really smooth. You can ride a horse or a boat everywhere, so travelling long distances is not a problem. As an assassin, you can climb everywhere and use stealth in many occaisons. Combat is very exciting. It's classic rpg-style combat (light attack, heavy attack, charged attack, block and dodge) so easy to learn, but harder to master. You fight enemies based on lvl, so you need to earn xp through quests, activities and world exploration to progress. You can fight many types of enemies (humans and animals), there are also mini bosses, arena bosses and very big bosses (elephants, gods). There are many type of weapons you can fight with. You can also use many types of bows, sleeping darts, or fire bombs. On the other hand, weapons of the same type are not very different from each other (except legendary gear). You can also customize your character with many skills and perks through 3 skill trees. There are aslo many outfits that your character can wear. You can find a few graphical and gameplay bugs present, but nothing significant.

Story
It's decent, because it delivers what the title promises: how and where were assassasins founded. You play as Bayek - a medjay of Egypt to achieve justice. It has It's strong and even emotional moments. Also ending is great. Many side quests expand the main story really nicely. Some has very simple and usual story. The good thing is, that there are many of side quests, so it can take a while to complete them all. Modern story is still present, but not very much and it's really poor.

Activities
There are lots of them and they are very enjoyable. Except of main story and side quests, you can complete outposts (berserk mode or stealth mode) hunt for treasures, solve riddles, explore ancient tombs, fight in the arena, race in hypodrome, clear animal dens and fight gods or war elephants. There are ton of these activities through out of whole map, so it will take a while to complete them all (if you want to).

Enviroment
Everybody knows, that one thing that Ubisoft can do right, is enviroment. The Egypt is huge, beautiful, living place. From crowded cities filled with real life buildings/monuments to lovely villages and fields. Because we are in Africa, huge part of the map cover dry deserts (some with oasies) and mountains. From a graphics standpoint, it's really well made. Amazing water effects, lighting effects, textures, particals, shadows and everything else. Sometimes I cought myself wandering around the map, admiring the beauty of the world. Really good job Ubi !

Conclusion
Great RPG set in gorgeous Egypt with many things to do that is still worthy member of the assassin's saga.

Assassin's Creed Origins brought to me some fresh air for this series. The game brings us to the old Egypt and let us play as Bayek of Siwa, a Medjay of the Old Kingdom.
The game is gorgeous to look at, I couldn't exactly play it at maximum details because of the horrible optimization this game has, but even so I loved the graphic and aesthetic the game offered me.
The gameplay received a complete overhaul, the game is now an rpg with equipment to loot and improve, rarity of items, skills to get, etc.
Combat-wise you can't win by counterattacking dumb enemies anymore (thank you), you have different kind of weapons that you can use, each with different properties. To make it short every type of weapon has different attack speed, damage and reach. I played mostly with an halberd, it was slow, it was heavy hitting and had a long reach. I had tons of fun with that.
You also charge adrenaline when fighting that will allow you to perform an "Overpower" move that basically lets you do a lot of damage to an enemy, I usually just one shot them with the Halberd.
As every open world game, you get a lot of little side activities you can do. Aside for the Synchronization points, there are several side quests, tombs to explore, an arena where you can fight for the glory and (if you're into that) a hippodrome where you can race.
There are also some forts you can "conquer" by killing the captain and/or commander of the fort. It's not really conquer since the enemies will remain in the fort, but after looting all the chests in the fort and killing the leaders of the place the game will tell you that the location was completed.
I personally enjoyed the story of the game where you follow the adventures of Bayek until you see how they formed the Assassin's Creed, plus it's always good for me to have a character that is not a clone of Desmond Miles.
Honestly, if they took out the part where you are "this girl" that enters the Animus to check on memories because she's a researcher of some kind that "whatever I don't care let me play Bayek!", I would be even happier.
The reason I say this is because the sessions you play outside the Animus are three if I recall correctly, and neither of them add much to the story. They're just there to let you know that you are X playing in the Animus. In all honesty, I never cared for the guy/girl outside the Animus and I never will, the only thing the game does when they force me to play with them is break the action and the enjoyment I was experiencing while playing inside the Animus.

The only, really bad, thing that I can say about this game is the optimization. I never understood the causes, some say it's because of the triple-layered DRMs that they put in the game, but this game burns your CPU in a horrible way.
I played this game on two rigs and both of them struggled to keep this game over 30 fps in areas like Alexandria. This is not acceptable. Just for the sake of information I post my specific of both PCs:
1°: CPU: Intel Core I5-6500 3.20GHz - 8GB Ram - GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6Gb
2°: CPU: Intel Core I7-7700HQ 2.80GHz - 8GB Ram - GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6Gb
I tried everything I could to make it run decently, the only thing I could do is set most details to Low hoping the game wouldn't stagger so much in very populated areas. Honestly? I hope Odyssey makes a better job.
I strongly advise to purchase the game outside of Steam in order to have one less DRM. It probably won't solve the problems, but you'll have one less software running in the background while playing.

Aside this problem that I had, the game is awesome and I definitely reccomend it to anyone who's looking for a good open world action Rpg.

In Origins you play (most of the time) as Bayek, Egypt's last medjay (sort of a freelance cop, with a badge and everything), whose grim tale of personal revenge and earnest desire to right wrongs among the locals soon spreads into a quest to rid Egypt of corrupt, powerful, anonymous figures who operate behind the scenes. Bayek isn't just a warrior but also a detective: investigating and stalking his prey, first rooting out the true identities of these shadowy figures, then infiltrating their lairs and sanctums, and finally putting an assassin's blade through their necks. (And then having a lengthy conversation with them—this is Assassin's Creed, after all.) Bayek's quests take him from his small home village of Siwa to the great pantheons of Alexandria to the Nile Delta and beyond, and lets him rub shoulders with figures like Julius Caesar and Cleopatra.
The Egypt of Origins is a stunningly lovely place and I spent a lot of time simply soaking in the sights. Some areas of the map are expansive barren deserts or open seas, and while seemingly desolate of quests they're still well worth exploring to discover their few curiosities and surprises. Towns and villages are bustling with citizens, farmers, workers, and soldiers. There's plenty of dangerous (and eventually tamable) wildlife from vicious crocs and hippos lurking in the Nile to lions and hyenas prowling the sand dunes and rocky hills to flamingos and egrets that take flight when you thunder past on horseback. The simulation in Origins doesn't go below surface level, but if not a living world it's at least a lively one. And wow, it's big. After 35 hours of play, when I'd completed the main quest, tackled tons of side quests, solved puzzles, collected treasures, killed scores of enemies, and done lots of free-form exploring, hunting, and looting, there were still entire darkened regions of the map I hadn't yet set foot in. Origins is a damn big game in an even bigger world.
How the world is divided up isn't my favorite thing ever. It's MMO style, with different regions appropriate for different character levels. If you're level 8, and you cross a border from a region marked for levels 7-9 and into a region marked for level 17-20, well, nice knowing you. No matter your skills and gear, you simply can't take on an enemy too high above your own level: your attacks just won't do enough damage and their attacks will one-hit murderize you. This gives portions of the map a feeling of artificial difficulty, an open world where you're free to go anywhere but not really free to do anything, at least until you've leveled up. When you begin playing you can make a beeline for Giza's pyramids or Krocodilopolis: maybe you'll get there in one piece, or maybe you'll be insta-killed by a hyena that's 15 levels above you.

While I don't care for that particular brand of world creation, I didn't feel stifled by it that often. There were always enough level-appropriate areas to visit, explore, quest, and fight in (plus revisiting a low-level area when you've grown far beyond it can make you feel like a living god, which is pretty satisfying). And for the first time in what feels like a long time for Ubisoft, the world is filled with things to do without going overboard and looking as if someone spilled an overflowing sack of icons on a map. There are plenty of distractions as you ride from quest to quest, and lots of diversions to come across while exploring, but it never feels bloated or over-stuffed with tasks that require you to hop off your camel every few feet or disrupt your progress with the distraction of endless collectibles.

Origins also has gladiator challenges, chariot races, several types of brief radiant quests, and a few arenas in which to fight armored, rampaging elephants, if that's your particular dream. One of my favorite activities is a quieter, calmer one: a series of papyrus scrolls, which act like treasure maps. First you have to find the scrolls themselves, then decipher a riddle which leads you to leveled loot somewhere else on the map. It's a fun activity that promotes exploration, and takes you to areas you may have overlooked otherwise. For those hoping for more Black Flag ship-to-ship combat, there is a bit, but only in a few self-contained sequences.
Combat in Origins is based on dodging, blocking, and attacks of different speeds depending on the type of weapon you're using, complemented with unlockable skills. It can sometimes feel a bit mushy: dodging, in particular, can be finicky when you're locked onto enemies, and later in the game I became so reliant on a shield bash skill and a single charged strike that fights, while fun, became fairly identical. The new system could use some refining, but I wound up preferring its more methodical approach to previous Assassin's Creed animated combo moves.

There's also a great series of enemies called the Phylakes: a handful of imposing and ridiculously powerful warriors who individually prowl the map looking for you. They've got massive health bars and brutally deadly weapons, and I found myself loving how unfairly difficult they are to beat. There I am, an unstoppable badass with magic weapons and improbable skills, riding triumphantly away from a fortress of soldiers I'd just easily slashed and stabbed my way through. Then I'd spot a Phylake approaching on the road ahead, and would be forced to slink off and hide in the bushes quietly until he had passed. The Phylakes are humbling, and being humbled occasionally is a good thing.

At one point, when I was level 32, I encountered a level 20 Phylake. I cockily unequipped all my weapons, thinking how satisfying it would be to exact my revenge on one of these super-powered bastards with my bare fists. Uh, nope. He was still too tough. I had to switch back to blades halfway through the fight to finish him off.
The story has a couple laborious beats, and there are a few brief jumps to see how things are going in the future (I'm not a fan of the Abstergo crap), but Origins' plot is a good one with a few dabs of humor and heart. I only occasionally skipped through cutscenes, and I'm a legendary cut-scene skipper. Even for a cynic like me, witnessing the beginnings of the brotherhood was a bit of a thrill. Yes, the word "creed" is spoken weightily a few too many times (we get it) but I can't say it wasn't genuinely cool to witness the birth of the Assassins. Prequels are tough to pull off without them feeling clunky and overly referential, but the origin story mentioned in the title is handled pretty nicely.

Naturally, once you've beaten the main quests you can continue exploring the world, and the biggest compliment I can give Origins is that I'd much rather be playing it than writing about it. It's a got a dazzling and beautiful setting, lots of enjoyable systems for mischief and mayhem, and has just the right amount of diversions and distractions to keep you busy without ever feeling like busywork. The extra year Ubisoft took with Origins didn't result in a completely new and novel experience, but it did provide one of the best games in the Assassin's Creed series.

This is a good game. Players can really get involve in the game, feel like they are the real protector. Personally, I will play this game at least two times and really try to understand all the details.

我英文不是很好，其中有好些东西没有表达清楚。这里用中文再写一次，希望有人能看到。这款游戏最特别的地方是它的支线任务都是有意义的，而且甚至有些是自成一系的，是完整的。这个有些和其他我玩过的游戏最大的差别在于这款游戏它让我觉得我真的是埃及守护者，而且有许多日常任务都是我想当喜欢的，因为对我来说老是玩主线也会腻的，像是call of duty， 支线任务丰富了情节的同事也增加了带入感。我希望assassin greed 系列能够继续保持这种水准。

PS: This is the first time that I write comment on Steam. It is because I really apprectiate the work. Thank you.

Where to begin?

I guess I'll start with the design. Everything about ACO is beautiful. The people, the wildlife, the atmosphere, even the sand. And don't get me started on the architecture... This may be my childhood obsession with ancient Egypt coming back a little bit, but this game is just gorgeous.

As far as story goes, I haven't felt this satisfied in a game's story since GTA San Andreas. I might even be MORE satisfied with Origins. Very emotionally investing, I nearly cried several times during the story, but at the end.... I lost it. Beautiful story.

I still have much of Egypt to explore and help, so I'm sure I'll be sinking lots more hours into this game. And that's before the expansions release.

As the first AC game I've played (I have all of them, just haven't played them yet) I give this a very solid 10/10

8.5/10
The historically significant of Assassin's Creed Origins is far more than the gameplay itself, Ubisoft art team ambitiously reconstructed entire Egypt under the Ptolemaic dynasty and polished the world near perfection, but unfortunately, its poor narrative doesn't deserve such a beautiful map.

Pros:
1. WORLD: Ptolemaic Egypt combined both the elegance of Greece and the exoticism of ancient Egypt, from the majestic city of Alexandria to the quaint Egyptian cities of Memphis and Faiyum, from vibrant banks of the Nile to endless desert under golden sunset, each location in the game has its unique beauty.
When I stood atop the Great Pyramid of Giza, the pinnacle of Egyptian civilization, and looked across the entire Nile, there are no words that can describe the spectacular sensation of travelling through history.

2. COMBAT SYSTEM: The combat system has been systematically overhauled from the traditional Assassin's Creed, the blocking attack and dodging attack are thrilling and entertaining. Players can still enjoy the fun of being an assassin with the traditional sneaking and assassination elements perfectly combined.
You can choose your fighting style using various types of weapons, with a wide variety of tools to assist with your combat and assassinations such as sleep darts, berserk darts, smoke grenades and firebombs.

3. SIDE QUEST: Although most of the side quests are about locating, rescuing, or assassinating a target, which is relatively mediocre compared to Witcher III's side quests, one thing I can't deny is that they still offer me the pleasure of exploring the map and experiencing life in ancient Egypt.

4. ANIMALS: A wide variety of animals enriches the player's exploration experience, each predator has its unique preying style.

5. EAGLE VISION: The player can explore the map and find targets with the eagle (More like a drone to be precise), although the repetitive reliance on the eagle dampens the fun of exploration, I think this design is a successful innovation.


Cons:
1. MAIN STORY: The main story of Origins is the biggest failure of the entire game. The entire main story feels more like a kill list than an adventure, Bayek, the protagonist and his wife Aya avenge for their son from start to finish without any transition in character, the villains are as characterless as a ragdolls provided to the player to assassinate, and even the most important historical figures in the game, Cleopatra, and Caesar, are unattractive, devoid of depth and historical accuracy as they are portrayed in children's storybooks.
The story in Assassin's Creed II also consists mainly of a kill list, but the player can experience the growth of the protagonist, Ezio, and there is much more depth to the characters portrayed. The assassination of Caesar by the female protagonist Aya is one of the most disgusting scene in the entire game for me, she assassinated Caesar purely for the sake of assassination, there is no motivation for Aya’s action.

2. OPEN WORLD FORMULA: The tremendous number of outposts and treasures bored me to the hell, the number of enemy camps alone amounted to nearly two hundred, each with similar objectives, Ubisoft's open-world formula just copy and paste over and over again and destroyed the fun of exploration, although these objectives are not mandatory, the countless repetitive question marks only make players feel sick.

3. WEAPON: Although there is a wide variety of weapons, most of them are scraps, only a handful of golden weapons that can be constantly upgraded are usable, once you got a golden weapon, you can use it forever, collecting and selling those low-level weapons becomes burdensome for players.

Assassins creed origins, what I view as the last true assassins creed game.
I'm not sure where to start with this game, I bought it years ago and played it for roughly 9 hours, basically just two to three days, and then dropped it. I reinstalled it over and over opened it then closed it then uninstalled it and repeat for years, and I'm not sure what, but it finally clicked in the last few weeks. I picked it up and just started walking around and finally figured out why I love this game.
1. The World
Ubisoft is a lot of things, almost none of it great, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if they can't make an absolutely gorgeous open world. This game received some criticism saying that this setting was "bland" and "just a desert" and while yes it is a desert, it is a beautiful one. I would often find myself finding the places with the longest spanning dunes and just walking taking in how amazing it looked. Climbing the pyramids was an amazing activity and every city felt like it was unique, I would know what city I was in if someone were to blindfold me and place me inside. Every place in this game is just oozing with great design and although the parkour has fallen from where it once was, exploration has never been more of a joy.
2. The characters
Bayek, oh Bayek, what a great character, genuinely my second favorite character in the franchise behind Ezio. His story and everything about him is awesome and I believe he should've been the focus of the entire RPG trilogy. Every other character is also great, Aya and the love arc between her and Bayek was heartbreaking and beautiful. The only character I felt was underdeveloped was Bayek's best friend but even side characters who were nothing but the subject of sidequests were still memorable and the entire arc of cyrene was unbelievable fun
3. Combat
The gameplay of AC: ORIGINS was a total change from almost every previous game, it's a lot harder (aside from unity) than every previous assassins creed game but it also feels a lot better. Every game before combat was cool, but it was a joke. All I had to do to win was stand and click one button and then click another button, but this game changed that. While still being simple it's a lot more dangerous, and enemies can actually pose a threat, leading into
4. Stealth
The last good stealth in assassins creed. many complained about the level assassination thing, but it never posed an issue for me, as even captains fell to a single stealth attack most of the game because I wanted it to be that way, I spec'd into stealth and the hidden blade. and while less gadgets were also unbelievable useful in stealth unlike the newest additions. The sleep dart became my go to, knocking out guards who could pose an issue or even guards that noticed me, and smoke bombs were the go to for taking out multiple groups of enemies. Stealth was challenging, far more challenging than most of the franchise, but also rewarding. Taking out camps using stealth was amazingly satisfying unlike Valhalla and I never got angry at being spotted, because it didn't feel unfair.

All in all, I love this game, and while there are issues like the mainly alright ending and the fire effects, this game is a high recommend and I think more people need to give it a chance

Franchise Reimagined
Before Origins came out, Assassin’s Creed as a franchise was in trouble. We were getting yearly releases that were rushed, full of bugs and all felt like the same game. Sales and playerbase were getting lower with each new release. Ubisoft had to rethink their approach and bring us something different if they are to keep one of their most successful franchises going. And that is exactly what we got with Origins. They kept the same general feeling of AC but made it more like an RPG with engaging combat and a progression system.

Setting
Ancient Egypt was a perfect setting to bring revamped AC to. Egypt was one of the desired locations even since AC 2 in 2009, and now we are able to experience it in its full graphical potential. AC always had great world and environment design, and with Origins, they just stepped it to another level. All the content in the game was designed by referencing real world information available from museums, libraries and Egyptologists. This helped create as realistic ancient Egypt as possible. There is even a “Discovery Mode” in the game that acts as a guided tour of the history of the time period that can be used as a teaching material in schools. It was an absolute joy exploring different locations and imagining how life could have been back then. It is something that any history buff will appreciate.

Gameplay
The whole gameplay has been given an RPG overhaul. You level up your character and so some missions and enemies are out of reach until you are close to their level, this may be annoying to some. If you do all the side content along the way you will be more than enough level for any engagement, which in turn makes them too easy. So it’s a tough balancing act. The weapons increase in quality as you progress so you are encouraged to swap them out when you find something better. There are also variety of weapon types that offer you different opportunities combat wise. Combat itself is now completely different. You are not just focused on parrying like in previous games. You can string combos with light and heavy attacks, dodging and blocking - overall the combat is much more involved and engaging. Stealth is still an important part of the game and the most viable way to take on big encampments. There are also many different skills to level up along the way. They are split up in 3 paths: melee combat, range and traps. If you do everything, eventually you are able to unlock them all, it’s just a matter of order in which you do it and what you want to focus on first. The skills can be pretty useful and provide for some nice benefits.

Conclusion
Having played all previous AC’s, my favorite part has always been exploration and experience of the given historic time period. The games always had this part nailed down and Origins is no different. Ancient Egypt is perhaps the most beautiful setting yet with historical accuracy, vibrant colors and attention to detail. I am very glad about the gameplay changes that they introduced to the series. Now combat is also a cool component of the games and does not revolve around just stealth and parrying. I will always look forward to see what the next games will bring to the series.

Hello everyone,

I just want to say that: this game is INCREDIBLE!

Beautiful by its graphics and rich by its innumerable quests of all kinds!

I started with the AC1 with the Templars when I was younger, to continue with the 2 and his Italian universe of the Renaissance! I tested Black Flags, which I did not like, but that one .... My God! I love it!

The graphics, I repeat again, are really crazy and the equipment and predators are clearly more numerous!

I dont know what to tell you ...

If you like a GIGANTIC open world (no multi-player, except in the arena) and exploration, while facing more and more tough enemies, this game is for YOU!

Buy it during sales! (even the extensions are cool)

Regards,

Abby

Origins is one of the prettiest games I've probably ever played, especially given that I love Egyptian history. I've easily taken the most screenshots in this game than any other game I've played (even though the quality seems to dip in the screenshots compared to the actual game).

But after the shiny coat of paint, Origins suffers from repetitive gameplay loops that ultimately sour the experience. Running from location to location clearing bandit camps, synchronizing points, and swimming underwater for treasure is the bulk of the game. I will say that the tombs are enjoyable and unnecessarily creepy.

Bayek and the story carried me through the drag the game became. It's a fresh take on a series that sorely needed one. Each character is voiced magnificently and the missions are pretty awe inspiring.

I've been a huge fan of the AC series, even went it went downhill, was kinda losing hope for the series, but this one, this one freaking awesome game restored all hope for me, had so much fun with it and still having, can't wait for more dlc's to get released!

Even if you're unfamiliar with the franchise, but like open-world ancient times, stealth, partially RPG game with fun combat and a beautiful world to see, definitely get this.

This is another Assassin's Creed game where the Developers changed the Fighting style which was disappointment to some. I would say it was a fresh start again as the previous styles were feeling too easy and adding the RPG element really gave it a good Outline. I am glad for one more thing as they did not remove the elements that make an Assassin's Creed game, the viewpoints, the Outposts and most importantly the Beautiful Past worlds.

This game is not just the game its completely another World where you get to know the past Egyptian world in its form that has been discovered by the Raiders and Discoverers. The Character Development is Good but the historical figures felt really dull. Maybe I don't have the true knowledge about ancient Egypt other than Pharaohs and Moses. Most Importantly you will witness the Birth of Creed. It was a great Run playing this game which I will never Ever forget.

Please Stop Comparing this game to Witcher 3 as it was a great Game but they both are different games.

Overall,
9 out of 10 from Me and Greatly Recommended.

Before:

Starts game > Ubisoft Connect > Enter email & password (even though already ticked remember me for the 100th time > connecting > starting game > fail to sync > retry > fail to sync > retry fail to sync > skip > unable to start game > turns steam off > repeat steps 1-7 > enter game > again requests for email and password > reenters email and password

Why do we do this? Just to suffer?

Every. Damn. Time.

Games good though, other than the starting the game shenanigans...

Now:

All the problems from the initial review has been fixed and therefore changing to recommended.

Bought and refunded. Listen to everyone people. My computer has more than enough for this game and my Fps was clipping down to 15 every 5 seconds or so. After about 15-20 minutes in the lag and black screen flicker was too much to even get to enjoy playing the game.

SO;
Do not buy till they fix the anti piracy software (by removing it) because it will run like trash.
The game it self seemed kind of fun for the five minutes I got to actually enjoy.

It is the first AC since AC2 which I really liked.

UPD:
Let me try to explain why I don't think AC4 is really good. AC series generally try to create some personality it the character we play. OK, AC1 was a sandbox with parkour before it started to be mainstream, scenario wasn't the main focus. But for AC2 they came up with a character who tries to make things right. I can easily identify myself with. That's why I stormed through AC2, then Brotherhood, then Revelations. It was a little sad to let Ezio go.

In AC3, though Connor's story was tragic, his motivation always felt a little childish. They tried to create drama, but it was too artificial (if such can be said in regards to computer game). Now, AC4. For me it was difficult to sympathize Edward, it was hard to understand what all this suffering is for. Kills, has fun with money, plunders, has fun with money. Repeat if needed. He is very shallow for the most of the game. By the ending they tried to show how good he became, how it all transformed him into a better man, but it was too late to repair all this impression. If this moment happened in the first part of the game, maybe AC4 would have fallen into "really liked" category, but I'm not sure.

In case of Bayek it's easier to see good person in him, to see what he cares for and why he struggles so much with his vendetta. It made me wanting to see what else world has prepared for him. And it is interesting how Bayek's story will continue to unfold in DLCs.

Let me start this with that I absolutely love Assassin's Creed Origins. Almost everything in the game was great, and some stuff was arguably even perfect. The world, the music, the characters, the locations.

I waited to play this game for at least 8 months. I even read the book, Desert Oath. And I was so hyped, and for a reason. The world is incredibly immersive and beautiful. I think AC Odyssey missed much of the stuff that made this one so great.

AC Origins is mostly a serious game. It fits perfectly to the setting and Egypt, which is experiencing huge changes. In my opinion, the game could've been even more serious.
Before I got the game I knew that the graphics were amazing and the world was great. The music was a masterpiece and the characters likeable. The only thing I was skeptical about was the gameplay. Turns out that it was fine. Actually I really liked the combat and riding.
Now the stuff that maybe could be even better.

The story. It was great, but I felt a bit disappointed somehow. The ending was relatively satisfying but I still felt like something was missing. I guess I didn't like how the story evolved from being a personal quest for vengeance, to a power struggle for Egypt and the Apple of Eden. I liked the start though.
The NPCs. The NPCs were fine, but I would've hoped for them to be even more reactive to stuff, and they could've spoken more.

Also the DLCs we're just fine. You won't lose that much if you don't play them, but if you love the game, and just want more of the gameplay and world, play them.

Now, I like to rate stuff with scores so here we go:

Music - 10 ( it fits the game perfectly )
Gameplay - 9
World - 10
Story - 8
Characters - 9
Immersiveness - 9
DLCs - 7

Lastly I want to say that this game requires a quite beefy computer so beware. That's the reason I couldn't play it earlier.
Now go play it already!!!

Overview

Just at the moment I lost all hope with the Assassin's Creed series, Origins happened and I thank Ubisoft for that. For those who are too lazy to read this review, here is a summary: this game is immersive, the map is huge and it is waiting to be explored, every once in a while AC: Origins will make you stop and appreciate the scenery around you. Even if you are not into the AC series, try to give it a shot and decide after you watch a sunrise in the desert!

Graphics

Well, this is no brainer. The game has awesome graphics. However, in order to run the game in Ultra and enjoy it fully, you really need a good rig. I myself run the game on a midtier GPU and get 40-50 FPS with some settings on High, some on Medium. No stutter, no crash, no lag, just fluid gameplay. But I've read people that can't run the game with better rigs than mine, so I guess it is a win or lose situation. If you think getting less than 60 FPS makes the game unplayable, then you might want to wait for a patch in order for Ubisoft to address the issue. From what I've read, their anti-piracy protocols cost us a few precious FPS.

Story

I'm 40-something hours into the game and I'm nowhere near the end, but as far as I've seen, since Altair and Ezio this is the first time an AC game has a good story. We are first introduced to Bayek and learn that he is a Medjay, an Egyptian warrior that protects the people of Egypt and the protector of the pharaoh. Eventually, the story will eventually lead to the foundation of the Brotherhood and how can an AC fan not be intrigued by this? Sure, along the way we get to learn more about Bayek and the story line mainly follows his personal motives, but in my opinion this makes the game much more immersive. Do I need to say he has a very cool wife?

Gameplay and Combat

You have the freedom to go anywhere, climb wherever you want, ride as far as you can, dive underwater, explore, take a boat to cross seas or lakes, get scared the first time you see a crocodile, learn that hippopotamuses have no mercy or get stuck in a tree because you are too scared to face the lions and tigers underneath which are waaaay too overpowered for you... and I can go on. AC Origins has an interactive world and gives you every opportunity to gain experience, loot rare or legendary weapons. Almost every location has codex and if you take your time to read, you understand that you are roaming the Ancient Egypt. You get to discover tombs, you get to see the pyramids inside and out. This is a big plus for me.

As for the combat, all I can say is that it feels more realistic than the other AC games. It is almost impossible not getting hit unless you are too good at dodging and in the early game, it's not really easy. There are places that make me stop and think before attacking. Rather than barging into a camp and stabbing anyone that stands in my way, I make plans so that I don't die. Remember those missions in early AC games that make you stealth kill your enemies but you fail and decide to smash buttons, hit every direction until you succeed? Well, stealth really works in your favor in this game. Oh and using bows is a thing too! They actually work!

To be honest, the leveling system is quite limited. You can easily get all the abilities and eventually you lose interest in the build tree. There really isn't a real building system going on, maybe in the early games but as you push through higher levels you understand that you are not tailoring a build to match your playing style, there is not much to choose between.

Overall

I thought my PC wouldn't be able to run this game so I passed it, eventually I received it as a gift and I was ready to refund. Thank god I didn't make that mistake. If I knew, I would have bought it myself! So I'm giving this game a 10/10 for all the fun and the quality time it offers. I hope this review was helpful and kudos to anyone who made it to the end!

Assassins Creed Origins, the latest game of the AC franchise, the fresh air that we need. This game has potential despite the flaws. Lets start with the review.

Graphic
Man, this is the prettiest AC I've ever player besides Syndicate. The lighting, heat effect, the draw distance and the water, oh god the water, are the most thing I like in ACO's graphic. Didnt know desert could be that pretty, and the water looks natural especially when I was on a boat. I still remember when I was in Siwa and on the way to Giza, I could see the shape of the pyramid from afar, like very far and got excited. When I reached the pyramid I climbed it straight to the top, and the view is amazing. Furthermore, once you progress the story further, you can see the Roman style building, which are also beautiful. Conclusion, ACO's graphic is the biggest improvement of the series.

The World
Well, I am happy that this time Ubisoft did it perfectly regarding the game's world. Egypt is alive gentlemen, when you are walking the road, you can see people minding their own business, from smithing, riding a carriage, children playing on the street, a group of flamingos flying through the air, animals rampage on nearby village, people singing together in group, so many diversities. Not like in other AC games where people just sort of walking and riding a vehicle, and simply talking to each to each other. The world in ACO is full of details, like animals, you can pet cats, dogs, when you walk in the field of flowers, Bayek put down his hands, reaching and feeling the flowers of wheats on his hands, when nightfall villagers will going back to their house, even the guards, and when you put something on fire, either guards of villagers will try to put it off. This makes exploring the world, going from one location to another location more interesting. And Bayek is an interesting man, the protagonist is likeable, he has personalities.

Story
This is my personal opinion, the story is the usual Ubisoft style, good at the beginning, but forced at the end, seriously, the ending is kinda forced to end, but its not a big problem, at least for me.

Combat
ACO is an rpg now, and combat is kinda sloppy. You have 2 attacks, light and strong. Keep pressint the light attack button for a string of combo, and for the strong attack, its used to break enemies's shield or to know them down. You can also guard using your shield, but honeslty, I rarely guard, the game isnt that hard, unless the enemies are gangin up on you. Another one is dodge, this is the one I use the most. Though more often than not, enemies still can hit you when you dodge. Also there are onlyseveral killing animation that you will see over and over on the course of the game, some good some just plain boring. Besides melee combat, there's a range combat, which is the most satisfying combat in ACO. Aiming is done by holding the RMB, and depends on whick type of bow you are using, each bow has different aiming mode, more will be explained in the gameplay section.

Gameplay
This is where I tell you the game's mechanic, combat is for combat only, while this is for everything AC:O has to offer. For starter, the stealth. Stealth is there, but its dumbed down, you cant merge with poeple to hid anymore, even the hiding spot is somewhat lacking, but bushes are abundant. Yeah, stealth is simplified in Origins. Next, the parkour, in Origins, you dont have to hold certain button in order to run/parkour/free run like previous AC games, Bayek is always running, and you can climb by pressing a button, again simplified. This can be bad or good depends on your taste, I am neutral regarding stealth and free run. But, fun thing is, you can climb almost anything in this game, which is nice.

Equipments, for weapons, you can several types of weapons such as, swords, sickle sword, dual sword, mace, axe, staff, predator bow, light bow, warrior bows. For melee weapons each has their own style and finishing animation, they even has different overpower move, some just give you adrenaline to attack and move faster, some will attack enemy and kill the in one hit. For bows, you have predator, light and warriors bow, as I stated before, when you aim down while using bow, the types of bow depends the aim interface. For light bow, its like a normal bow,but you can charge your shot; for warrior bow, its normal aim, but you cant charge your shot, instead it fires several arrows in quick succession (at most 3), and for predator, when you aim, it will give you a zoomed aim, its easier to hit further target with these bow, and with certain skill, you can guide your arrow into the enemy's head.

For armors, you got shield, which is pretty useless for me, outfits, your 5 basic equips brace, quiver, breastplate, tool pouch and hidden blade, each can be upgraded into legendary using materials and will increase their corresponding atributes. Upgrade them based on your playstyle, either full frontal combat or stealth combat. Outfits can be bought from the weaver shops, sometimes you can buy legendary outfit from the shops, other legendaries can be gotten by completing certain events like chariot race, arenas, daily quests from Reda, or by Heka Chests you bought from Reda with 3000 drachmas (contains random loot).Every outfits can be gotten from the Heka chests, but it need tons of drachmas, except for the Isu Armor, you have to get all the zodiak circle, has 50 silicas and enter the Sphinx, you will get the armor there.

Mounts, since Egypt is massive, you will need mounts. There are 3 types of mounts, chariot, horse and camels. Chariot is faster than the other 2, while horses and camles are similar. Mounts also has quality, but even if you get legendary mount, it wont affect anything aside from getting an achievement for it.

Materials can be gotten by exploring the world and looting everything, or by killing the guards whom are transporting the resources you want. You can find the transporters by scouting with Senu and mark them so that they can appear on your screen. Be careful, if you are in the middle of a fight with the transporters, other guards transporting another resources may pass and enjoy your party, so you might end up against 8-12 enemies. The transporting guards only transports resources like metals, drachma and woods, for skins you have to hunt animals, such as hyenas, crocodiles, hippos, and lions.

Skill, AC:O has 3 skills category, warrior, hunter and seer. Warrior is obvious, Hunter is for bow and stealth mainly, and Seer's skills affecting tools damage and unlock, shop unclock, breathing, taming animal etc. I recommend getting the bow or warrior skills first, especially the bow. Guiding arrow through the enemies head never gets old.

The microtransaction is there, but its not lootboxes, but its not as intrusive and the game doesnt constantly reminding you of its presence like in Shadow of War, the store even located on its own section, and Ubisoft sells you an item for a price, not being randomized, its an item, like the mummy outfit, unicorn mount, time saver pack, etc. I am not defending this, I am just stating a fact.

Optimization
Now this is one of the bad of Origins, because the game is plagued by DRM fest, VMProtect, Denuvo, Uplay and Steam, it affects the game's performance. WIth i5-6600k 1070 16GB, I can get Ultra setting with 30-50ish fps, unstable. After I bought i7-7700k, I got 60-80ish fps. I will test the free version once it's released.

Conclusion:
Origins is a good game despite of the flaws, it has moderate to a lot of content (this is purely subjective), pretty graphic, a lively world, ok story, you get your money's worth. But all of those are ruined by performance issue, after the patch it helps a bit, but still freezing sometimes with my i5-6600k, I dont know if its because of the DRM or other things.
Wait until this problem is fixed, if its not fixed then I recommend get this on sale.

Good Action RPG but a bad Assassin’s Creed title
Pros:
Great story and setting
Beautiful graphics
Decent RPG elements
Combat is good with a variety of weapons, tools, and attack types
Exploring tombs and pyramids is fun

Cons:
Huge open world full of filler content
Watered down Assassin’s Creed elements
There are microtransactions
Slight optimization issue with frame rate drops

Average:
For all intents and purpose the game feels rushed. It is very ambitious but rough around the edges.
The music is there only to fill the background, nothing impressive.
Some side quests are interesting but majority of it feels like a chore i.e., go there and fetch/kill this. None of them are polished and often feel incomplete even after finishing the quest. Most of the quests don’t offer any choice and there is only one predetermined outcome. You need to finish a few side quests though for they give a lot of XP which is necessary for levelling up.
Rating: 7.5/10
Advice: Buy only when discounted

I can't write enough to convey my fondness for this title; Assassin's Creed Origins is a beautiful labour of love that is clearly shown in its storytelling, character development and open world gameplay. Yes, it retains its equitable share of plot holes though I don’t begrudge it. It simply makes it up for the visual treat and rewarding side quests that can be undertaken anytime at your leisure. Also, the discovery tour as a museum style mash-up acts as a great supplemental tool to learn and visually explore that specific historic time frame. While its unfortunate I cannot review this game in Hieroglyphics, I would to say again to all those involved in making this game, Thank you. It's clear the team involved took some advice from the Ished Tree (Ancient Egyptian Tree of Life) - The nut doesn't reveal the tree it contains.
Translation: A wish or project is full of possibilities. Nurture it carefully to see it grow into a giant "tree".

Solid game with enough variety to keep you busy.The map is big , you can explore.Consider buying the game on sale for the best price.Theres a lot of side missions and you'll need to grind for some story missions.The dlc/s are pretty expensive dont buy them unless they are on sale.
Story:7/10
Gameplay:7/10
Freerun:10/10
Graphics:8.5/10
Overall:7.5/10

First impression
#Assassins Creed Origins#
১। এই পর্যন্ত খেলে যা বুঝলাম, বিশাল লম্বা একটা গেম খেলতে যাচ্ছি।
মেইন মিশন খেলসি মাত্র ৩ টা, অথচ সাইড মিশন খেলে ফেললাম ৫-৬ টা
সাইড মিশন গুলা মেইন মিশন থেকে ফান বেশি।
২। অপটিমাইজেশন যেঁ একদম আহামরি ভাল টা কিন্তু না, কিন্তু আবার ghost recon wildlands / Watch dog 2 এর মত এক দম বাজেও না। তবে পাওারফুল সিস্টেম লাগবে গেম টি আরামে খেলতে হলে। আমি জিটিএক্স ১০৭০ দিয়ে আলট্রাতে ৬৫-৭০ করে এফ পি এস পাচ্ছি।
৩। বেশ ভাল একটা স্টোরি হতে যাচ্ছে, আর এইবারের প্রেসেনটেশন খুব দারুন।
৪। গেমপ্লে তে টিপিকাল Assassins Creed সিগ্নেচার তোঁ আছেই, সাথে এড হয়েছে ওয়ান vs ওয়ান কমবেট। আর আগেই বললাম অনেক অনেক আর পি জী ইলিমেনট। Origins এ আগের গেমগুলার মত সহজ গেমপ্লে হবে না, আমি লেভেল ২ ছিলাম, লেভেল ৫ এর এক সৈন্য কে মারতে হালুয়া টাইট হইসে আমার।
৫। ফোটো মোড ; এক কথায় অসাধারণ
৬। Ubisoft এর কোন গেমেই আমি স্টিম এচিভমেন্ট
পাইনাই,Assassins Creed Origins স্টিম এচিভমেন্ট আছে।
Ubisoft এর সব গেমের এচিভমেন্ট uPlay তে থাকে সাধারনত।
যাই হোক , বেষ্ট অফ লাক # Assassins Creed Origins
অনেক দিন পর মনের মত একটা Assassins Creed

#FIRST impression
#Assassin's creed origins "The Hidden Ones" dlc
৬ গিবি আপডেটের পর শুরু করলাম assassin's creed originss এর প্রথম DLC "The Hidden Ones".
গল্প : The Hidden ones এর গল্প শুরু হয় মুল গেমের গল্প যেখানে শেষ হইসে, তার থেকে চার বছর পরের ঘটনা গুলো কে কেন্দ্র করে। মুল গেমের বায়েক কে নিয়েই আপনাকে খেলতে হবে। ইজিপ্ট এর বাসিন্দাদের রোমান রাজত্ত্য থেকে মুক্তির জন্যেই মুলত Hidden ones দের লড়াই। এই DLC এর গল্পে Assassins দের আরও অনেক রহস্য উন্মচন হবে আশা করা যায়।
"All of these are based on true events"
ম্যাপ: এই DLC তে আপনাকে শিনাই পেনিন্সুলা নামক লোকেশনে ভ্রমন করতে হবে, যা কিনা মুল গেম থেকে একদম এ ভিন্ন্। এই বিশাল ম্যাপ এর অধিকাংশ এরিয়াই রোমান দের আয়ত্ত্যে। সবচচেয়ে মজার কথা হল, এই ম্যাপ টা মুল গেমের ম্যাপ এর চেয়েও অনেক বেশি সুন্দর।
গেম্পলে: সব কিছুই আগের মতই থাকবে, তবে এই DLC তে enemy লেভেল ৪০-৪৫ এর মধ্যে থাকবে। রোমান ক্যাম্প গুলা এবার আরও বিশাল, সুতরাং টেক্টিক্স ফলো করাই উত্তম। যদিওবা এটা একটা ডিএলসি, মমেইন মিশনের পাসাপাশি এতে অনেক অনেক সাইড মিশন আছে। বেস গেমের মতই এই ডিএল সি তে অনেক অনেক সাইড এক্তিভিটি আছে। ১০০% শেষ করতে মিনিমাম ১2-১৫ ঘণ্টা লাগবেই। এই ডিএল সির। জন্ন্যে আলাদা আরমর, ওয়েপন আর রাইড পাবেন।
যারা মুল গেম খেলে ফেলছেন তারা জলদি শুরু করেদিন The hidden ones,
আর যারা এখনো মুল গেমেই আটকে আছেন, তারাহুরার প্রয়জন নেই, মুল গেমের যে বিশাল কন্টেন্ট সেগুলা আস্তে ধিরে শেষ করুন, তারপর ডি এল সি ধরুন।
আমি মনে করি ASSASSINS CREED ORIGINS ২০১৭ এর অন্যতম বেস্ট গেম, যে পরিমান যত্ন দিয়ে আর নিখুত ভাবে গেম টি বানানো হইসে, devs must deserves a huge a appreciation. এই গেম দিয়ে AC series Strongly comeback করল। আশা করি ভবিষ্যৎ AC গেম গুলা আরর সফল হবে

(Playing this on a 4k monitor.)

This is probably the most beautiful game I've ever looked at, and that's a huge compliment after I've played Kingdom Come: Deliverance.

I'm NOT saying that everywhere you go you see insane-quality textures. This game is a bit more subtle. It's about the huge amount of great-quality textures coupled with breath-taking lighting, environment smoke/dust effects, immersive water physics, realistic-looking vegetation with vivid colors. The whole composition is impressive.

The scale is larger than KC:D. Kingdom Come hides it's cities with carefully placed treelines and ridges, so you dont see the neighboring town and feel the world is small. Not here. You'll see kilometers on the distance, and many, many small villages on your screen at the same time, if you get to a high place. Even small, random villages are larger than KC:D largest cities as well. There might not be much interaction on them, but they're nice anyway.

Every 10 minutes I get a jaw-dropping scene while doing whatever quest going from A to B... The game has a photomode which pauses time and lets you move the camera around, take a picture and upload it automatically so other players can see it on their map. In my 21 hours of gameplay so far, I've taken a few dozen pictures. It's THAT good.

I haven't used Fast Travel a single time. The game's just to relaxing and wholesome to be in.

With all that in mind. It is a mainstream game. It is easy. Play it on the hardest setting. Death has no consequence anyways.
The pleasure is in the story, the somewhat akin-to-life locations and the sight-seeing.

The game is beautiful when it works. It's tied to Uplay even tho Steam provides the same Digital Restriction Mangement (DRM). Every time I try to play Uplay gets in the way, looks for patches, freezes, asks for my password, doesn't remember, downloads a 60MB update, restarts,... It just never ends. I want to play the game, not fumble iwth DRM.

The bottom line would be I do recommend the game. It was in the end an enjoyable experience.

I got beef about some stuff, while loving others. Check it all to make sense of the chaos of this review.
I ended up referencing a few other titles while doing this, whether that is a no no or not.. I guess we'll see.

Okay, disclaimer is done, to the actual reviewing.
+It looks looks wondrous.
+Ran smooth so far ( FX 6300 3.5ghz & GTX 970 ssc, high settings or above)
+Gentle on my GPU. Something like Shadow of War makes my card really run its fans, 65% or higher, to the point I can almost hear it through my headphones. This doesn't do it. Not as much, and I appreciate that.
+The map so far is well designed, very lush and lively. I've enjoyed exploring it so far.
+The RPGness of it. Skills to acquire, gear to craft, all the weapons and equipment. But that's a double edged sword to get to later.
+It's a new AC! No but really, it's nice to have a new one release. The story telling so far has been pretty good and I look forward to doing more.
+Side Quests so far all have dialog. It's a very Witcher styled feeling beyond that though. To really be prepared for story quests, side ones are strongly recommended.
+ REACHING ALEXANDRIA REMINDS ME OF WHAT BROTHERHOOD COULD'VE BEEN. It feels so good. It really does feel so good to walk the city. So much focus about Egypt, and you forget what all you were gonna actually run into here. It's been minorly breathtaking.
+Soundtrack is pleasant. Same person who worked on Ac4 and Unity did this. I really enjoyed Black Flag, and parts of Unity's sound track, so it I'm diggin it.
+Depth. The year off I think gave Ubi the time they needed to ensure everyone felt more alive. Bayek is a fun character to watch develope more. And Aya isn't just a ghost. She has depth too, not such a fling as Elise. And they're oh so lovely together it mades me feel lonely.
+Plenty of cutscenes, voices, and excellent writing for small moment that give you giggles and nods.
+Reality has a third person thing again. I know some hate it for not simply being Desmond, but I like it so far.
+Easter Eggs hinting as franchises in the same universe are pretty cool.

Now, the beef and things I wanted to talk about. These aren't purely negative, but rather the stuff I have ups and downs with, or simply wanna babble about it seems.

-Its RPGness. It adds a new depth to the game you otherwise never had, but it brings in flaws. It reminds me of Division. In this, a headshot with an arrow can not always kill. And I now learned that you don't always get a pure assassination. They can resist it. I do not like that entirely. It's two small details about the whole style, but they're big deals to me.

-Stealth (assassinating) is underwhelming. I've since upgraded a lot of tools, learned the methods, and know how to creep far better, but it still lacks. They put forth so much effort into the combat, they left the stealth lack luster in return it feels. It's still better than any other in terms of creep stealthing though really. I'd enjoy seeing something like Blacklist method and variety for silent murder in future titles. Can really only chalk it up now as Bayek isn't really an Assassin in this one. He's a Warrior, a Guardian. Doesn't have the finesse for it yet. It's why his attacks are only one of a handful. No fancy takedowns. One can hope for the future though for more fluidity.

-Social stealth is absent. No more blending. You hide in bushes, or out of line of sight, but no more. I realize there is a franchise long debate about how it should or shouldn't work. Some tasks now, I kinda wish I could still do so. Being in Alexandria and not being able to upsets me.

-/+Combat. I put this as a mix because it isn't outright bad. You lose situational awareness the rest gave you before, though enough time has alleviated that. It's For Honor, thrusted into AC. It's how I've come to see it so far. Instead of the whole area being seen and having the scope of the whole fight available, it tunnel visions it to your front. That works in FH, seeing how the game was designed with the 1v1 encounters in mind. In this? It's a bit more detrimental to your health. I died a few times consecutively because I'm fighting average guys, and big Brutus here comes barreling from off screen and sticks a club in a place it shouldn't be. The locking system was weird, but eventually got used to it too. A soft version of Dark Souls maybe. Lock, block and strafe. Or don't at all, you don't have to after all.
There's a learning curve. For combat, and stealth. It gets easier. The skills, which I really should have mentioned somewhere, do each improve your gameplay. So it's helpful to pick and choose based on what you want to strengthen, or balance out your weaknesses.

-Parkour got more simplified. At first I had complaints you couldn't drop down right, couldn't decent safely and the such. I've since learned the proper method. A for controller, literally does it all for you. to close gaps up or down, jump straight forward, etc. B to decent is more for dropping to ledges. And you can still roll to avoid damage, you just need to tap A on landing. (A lack of high profile though I believe also limits the stealth capabilities.)

-I can't f&$%ing sprint mang? Dude can move at a healthy pace, but there is no, "Okay, go, NOW." speed. It's annoying. Camels are neat. Horses are nicer. All I need now is a suped up ricer. (Why did I rhyme that?)

-Random audio buzzing in various moment. It's just.. what? As I update this, I get them more and more often. Just a solid second of BRRZZZT and then the game goes on. Happens in cutscene transitions, or after deaths.

-Equipment screen is interesting. Two bows, two melee weapons, and one active tool. So to change dart types or bombs, you need to go into the menu itself and change. Weapons swapping between two isn't bad, but given current strength, I find myself needing to swap out empty bows for other two which are full often. Each bow type has its own ammo type as well, which I guess is nice.

As you level up, you get more power obviously. Bows work better, and having quiver upgrades stretch out time. Ensuring you loot prolongs a bow's use too.

- I CAN'T SPRINT, MY HORSE CAN'T GALLOP. I NEED TO GET OUT IN A HURRY AND I CAN'T. I realize I said no sprinting earlier, but a revisit to dying from lack of speed to escape brings me back here. I know making games isn't easy, but we need something that Ac3 had with horses. Come on Ubi.

Okay the whining is done.

It's fun. Not the same AC. It has For Honor, Witcher and Far Cry vibes. Even a little hint of Wildlands, eagle being the drone, minus exploding. Was also suggested it's a tad bit of Zelda. I never played them though, so I cannot say for certain.

If you don't mind it being a different feel, then for sure get it. If you cling to older AC styles too much, didn't like For Honor or Witcher that much, maybe watching a stream is a better choice, until maybe a sale or something.

However! Don't let me entirely deter you! I am enjoying myself, despite the distinct changes. It's a fresh breathe of air otherwise. Truth be told, AC hasn't really been the same since a blended line of Revelations and 3 anyway. Give it a chance if you want it. I do recommend it after all. The more I play it, the more it does feel like AC. I missed this.

I'm new at reviews, be merciful.

The truth is that talking about the big and small parts of Assassin's Creed: Origins and paying attention to all its content, pros and cons, is beyond the scope of this review and you should experience them yourself during the game.

Origins is another Assassin's Creed similar to the other games in the series, and it should be noted that apart from the story as well as some positive points that I will mention below, it has nothing new to offer players.

To activate Fast Travel, you still have to climb to the tallest buildings, jump from the top into a haystack, raise your level, and improve your skills by receiving a skill point. But the point is that Origins no longer give you different ways to complete the stages, and there is not much variety in side missions.

If you have experienced Ghost Recon: Wildlands in the past and its problems have not bothered you, Origins will probably be interesting for you. But if you can not stand the nerve-wracking camera, repetitive missions, technical glitches and combat difficulties, Assassin's Creed: Origins will not be for you and you can think of other games.

Now I will summarize the positive and negative points of the game:

Positive :
1- Different fighting style with each weapon and game upgrade system.
2- A beautiful story that explains the background of the basics in detail
3- Good characterization.
4- The beauty of historical monuments.
5- Excellent music and great sound.

cons :
1- Repetition of gameplay after a while
2 - Technical problems sometimes unbearable and nerve-wracking
3 - Lack of ability to customize buttons and camera problems
4 - Lack of interaction with the environment and repetition of combat animation in a short time.

With all the problems this game has, it is definitely worth a try. And I'm sure you will enjoy the fascinating scenery and design and the great historical story.

I haven't played AC since black flag but i'm extremely impressed with this one.

- Great customization.
- Interesting story. (Which is in Egypt of all places.)
- Smooth combat controls.
- Massive open world.

I would love to add a more in depth review just haven't played much more yet. But definitely a good purchase.

Assassin's Creed: Origins has been designed to waste your time.
Unfortunately there is no way to rate this game somewhere in between Good or Bad on Steam; it's not a bad game, but you have to be aware of what you're going in for. This is an extremely good looking game on the surface, that is completely shallow and empty underneath its golden, radiant coat of paint.
The story is completely wasted potential, and it has no cohesive structure as it feels like it's been designed by multiple people at various times. The character models, as usual for Ubisoft, look amazing and the art direction is phenomenal and creative. All characters and villains look distinct and original; it's too bad they're completely shallow, uninteresting, forgettable and, worst of all, wasted. There are hints throughout the game of what it could have been, but it never goes there. The game never separates itself from simply being a sand-box adventure with rpg elements in it.
The developers clearly took inspiration from The Witcher 3, but left out everything that made that game great, and missed the point. For example, the world is big. Too big, really. I got tired after a while, due to it being so uninteresting. It does the game no favour, it's no advantage leaving the player with at least 5 or 6 gigantic areas still to explore by the end of the main quest.
Sidequests are aplenty and a complete waste of time. They are boring writing, incredibly shallow and downright insulting to anyone's intelligence at times. It feels like the game tells you you're stupid and you're only here because of the fancy graphics and the freedom of exploration.
Indeed, I won't deny that what saves AC Origins is the world design, coupled with an extremely well realised lighting system. The view distance is insanely huge and makes the world feel real and beautiful to explore. If that's the only thing you're expecting, then this is the game for you.
Gameplay is repetitive however. Most, if not all sidequests and main quests usually end with the player being required to assassinate some target, usually in a fort, of which there are way too many. They're all different, yes, and there's a moderate amount of effort invested in making sure none of the hundreds of forts scattered around the map look the same. Unfortunately, they are the same, since you will use the same ways of clearing them and doing the checklist of treasures etc to clear and complete.
The music and soundtrack are okay when listened outside of the game, but really badly implemented within the actual cutscenes, exploration or combat.
Everything about this game is lazy and shallow and a disgrace to its legacy of past wonderful titles. However, it is entertaining at times and is a good way of sinking many hours of one's time.

PROS: Incredibly beautiful world, realised through astounding technology in graphics and lighting - mindless entertainment at times.

CONS: Story - Design - Gameplay - Lack of character development/drama - Repetitiveness

I was looking for an experience similar to the first Assassin's Creed game atmosphere-wise, and I wasn't disappointed.
The world sucks you in and is super fun to explore. Despite large chunks of the maps being desert, the terrain doesn't feel repetitive. The cities all have unique characteristics.

What I loved the most though were the characters. They have understandable motives and undergo lots of character development throughout the story. The main quest is very varied in themes and shows you around the map in a pretty linear way, which is neat. It also has a couple of moments that will absolutely rip your heart out. (Almost every storyline in the game is somehow connected with children. And as I understood, the director of Origins in reality also lost his child and through the game decided to show how hard it is for people after that.)
Discovery tour of Egypt, quite large and very interesting, you can learn a lot of little things, time frames and culture from the pharaohs to ordinary people, what they did, how they had fun and much more.
Especially considering that I love Egyptian history, I liked it, but after a brilliant coat of paint, Origins suffers from repetitive gameplay cycles that eventually spoil the impression. I also didn't like the finishing (it was fun at first), but after 30 hours they are very annoying and infuriating (I had a moment when a fire accidentally occurred and Bayek began to finish off the enemy for a long time, in the end I burned down😐) After that, I started actively using tools and a bow.
(And also, If you want to get all the achievements, you need to buy dlc.)

Review-Based on my own Opinion .

So its time to write a Review aswell. I played Assassins Creed Origins for arround 60 hours so far !
A time wich is important to give a full review ,
If you dont understand anything its maybe about my bad English. Lets get started .

1.Positive

1.1 The central storyline is for me one of the best in the entire Series .Closely Followed by Brotherhood and 2.
A good mixture of different tasks. Some quiet and some with Action.
The Story gives you a good imagination about a life as an Medjay

1.2 The Sidequests are not bad but there are some are quite the same and boring. But There are so many
Sidequests.I am sure there will be the right for you .
The EP in the sidequest are huge in my Opinion but its takes a bit time to reach higher Levels.

1.2 The Drops you will find in cases are different from rare to common.Some weapons are locked until you reach the
Level. A good feature .Its a good motivation to keep playing and doing Sidequests.

1.3 The World in Assassins Creed is insane. With many big citys and big deserts. So far there was never an big region
without something to look for. I played the game on medium Settings and still there it blows my mind .

1.4 The Combat System is one of the biggest differences to the other ACs . It takes a bit to handle it but it makes a battle more intense and difficult as before.

Negative.

1.1 Senu is not a complete failure . Imean its awesome to fly with him . But sometimes he cant find the easiest things.
Later with upgrades its getting better.

1.2 I personally miss it to use the Hidden Blade in Normal Fights not only as stealth Weapon.

Assassins Creed Origins 9/10

I'm sad to have to do this, but it's going to be a thumbs down for me.

It's just not Asassin's Creed anymore. With every launch it has been less about the asassinations and more about being transformed to fit into the amorphous blob that is the UBISoft sandbox game.

I'll get the pozitives out of the way quick as there's only two. The graphics (scenerey is absolutely jaw-droppingly gorgeous) and the characters. Bayek is not just a wooden plank with a frowny face drawn on it. He exibits emotion, showing both a sensitive, caring side and a violent, revenge-seeking side.

Everything else is dissapointing, and it all stems from one root cause. It's too "video gamey":

- The redesigned leveling system is awful. Are you telling me that just because some dude's floating number is greater than mine, suddenly a knife directly through his windpipe is not going to kill him? This is ludo-narrative dissonance in its purest form. Just like in The Division where you could pump a guy's skull full of sniper rounds and he wouldn't even flinch because his "level" is higher than yours. This screams in your face "WARNING! THIS IS YOUR HOURLY REMINDER THAT YOU ARE PLAYING A VIDEO GAME"

- The combat is a hot mess; I'm not sure why they changed it. Instead of dancing around the enemies and countering, you just roll around, hoping for an opening. And the "super moves"....oh my god the super moves. Yeah Bayek, slow down time by slamming your shield into the ground while you are moving at normal speed and while you're at it, why don't you also move a WOODEN ARROW through the air like it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ laser guided missle. It's not all bad, this game uses slo-mo properly sometimes like when you jump off a ledge and shoot with a bow, a slo-mo is activated. That's cool af. Makes me think there was one decent guy at the studio and the rest were busy partying like the Wolf on Wall Street.

- Stealth is laughably over simplified and uninteresting. What ever happened to the people that worked on Assassin's Creed 1? Yes, O-N-E. I remember when you showed up to a city with nothing but your hidden blade, the name of your target and a slap on the ass from your handler wishing you good luck. You had to blend in with the croud, research your target to find out where they reside, plan your infiltration and exfiltration. You could fight, but the spotlight was clearly on the stealth and asassinations. Yes it was a bit repetitive, but nothing that couldn't be fixed.

But here? Nah son. Bayek must have been bitten by a radioactive spider because he can just climb clearly flat surfaces. You don't need to plan any routes, see which walls you can climb because you can climb efectively anything. Crowd blending? Hiding in plain sight, right next to your target, just waiting for a chance? Nah son, from now on, you are only going to crouch in chest-high grass.

Stealth gameplay here is a straight flow-chart:

A) If the enemies are 4-5 levels higher than you, then don't even bother, because a blade through the rib cage doesn't matter if a magical floating number says so. Better go and grind some more

B) If there is chest high grass, go into said grass, stealth assassinate anyone who comes close

C) If there is no grass, shoot them from the rooftop with the laser guided missle predator arrow.

D) If there's no grass or buildings, just hack away at them and then finish them with your ...*sigh*... super move

I'm not even going to go into detail about how there's just so many uninteresting side-quests that play out the same because of how basic the stealth is, or how the game takes control away from you every 10 minutes when you are talking to someone to show you cutscenes, because they want to be "cinematic". Remember in AC1, where you could move around during cutscenes, the camera focused on your target and ominous music played? THAT was cinematic...

TL;DR

A massive waste of potential. I was hoping the year-long break they took from the series would help them go back to the series' roots (as the ORIGINS title implied), but we are instead greeted with dumbed down streamlined stealth play, clunky combat and a terrible leveling system that constantly reminds you that you are playing a video game.

PS:

I'm going to finish the game, since I care for the story, but I can't say I'm having a lot of fun. Mainly playing just for the act of finishing it...

Every grain of sand in the game was handcrafted, Jaw dropping beauty.

And also the sun is so warm in the game, my computer feels it.

I had a great time with this game during the Covid pandemic.

The Positives:
- The World, Egypt is incredible to look at, throughout my time with the game I stopped to look around the vistas, cities, canyons, deserts, and all the other incredible locations showcased in this game.
- The Immersion of the World, every location feels alive thanks to the AI, cats can be scratched and
you never feel as though the world was tailored to you. Egypt has a history and you get to witness this slice of time.
- The Roleplaying, Loads of variety of play styles available, there's an incredible amount of combination possible with the melee and ranged weapons present, I loved the roleplaying potential it had at the start of the game and wasn't disappointed to find my niche was loads of fun to play!
- The Combat - Incredibly satisfying with every weapon type.
- The Side Quests - I found them to be better than some of the Main Quest. It's a lot of fun to just help the people of Egypt with their profound problems. Very little "Bring me x number of y, x number of z,etc", more varied and engaging, character driven mini stories.
- The DLCs - I spent around 15 hours in both DLCs in a completionist play-style. The Hidden Ones DLC is focused of what I thought would present in the main map of Egypt. The problems with the first established Hidden Ones offices could have taken place as a prologue to the Main Quest, but it feels like a welcome addition with the introduction of Sinai. The foundation of the Creed is clear and necessary, mistakes are expected during the first years of a secret society. Old characters from the main game come back to be even more developed. The Curse of the Pharaohs is larger and more fascinating, I won't spoil it. It's worth the buy.
- Bayek - He is a great main character, enraged after the death of his son, the actor really brings it and makes this entry to the series memorable.

The Negative:
- The Main Story is overdeveloped at first and underdeveloped during the latter half. It's a bit rushed, it's noticeable.
- The Difficulty - It's really easy as a stealth game, which was annoying personally. I breezed through the game while completing it, no real puzzle in stealth. I expected legions of Romans in Egypt and ended up with barely 50 in the biggest Forts.

I'm a newbie in the Assassin's Creed universe, playing only AC3 until now, so I'm not going to compare Origins to the other installments.
There are way more pros than cons for this game, but the latter ruined my experience. Let's start with the pros:

Pros
- Amazing World Details:
This is in my opinion Origins' best feature. I loved every little bit of the map (from the vast deserts in the center and south of the map to the crowded cities of Memphis, Alexandria or Cyrene). Every region is unique, each with its' foreign or local influences in domains like architecture or society: Egyptian, Greek, Roman or combinations of them.
The landmarks are breathtaking: you can climb the Pyramids and the Lighthouse of Alexandria, visit the Tomb of Alexander the Great and the Library of Alexandria, or sail down the Nile (maybe the most fun I had in the game, sailing on the Nile with dozens of other boats alongside me).

- Role-playing and Combat:
A lot of people were deeply disappointed with the decision of adding RPG mechanics into the game, many claiming Origins isn't an Assassin's Creed game anymore. Again, I'll be unbiased and say that I liked the gameplay and I think the role-playing aspects were implemented well. The combat is pretty simple, light attack, heavy attacks against opponents with small shields, parry and dodge, plus the Overpower Attack which is very helpful in many situations.
There are many types of weapons which offer diversity in said combat, you have the long range spears, the short range but fast dual blades, the heavy, but slow blunts etc. You also have four types of bows, but I think everyone just goes for the Predator and Hunter ones. Horse fights and melee fights against animals are clunky and boring, although the naval combat is spectacular and awesome and I loved these fights weren't shoved down my throat, there being about 2 or 3 of them in the whole game.

- Historical personalities:
Again, many people complained here about Cleopatra and Julius Caesar being dull and superficial. Look, I'm a History student myself and I really don't mind this shallowness, it's just a game after all, not a graduation thesis, let them be lighthearted villains. I liked seeing both of them, Pompey, Ptolemy XIII, Brutus etc. in a modern game. It is a good combination between fiction and reality.

As I don't want to turn this into a 2000 words review I'll end the pros here. Other smaller pros would be Bayek's character and customization, Senu and her Eagle Vision and animal hunting, the small details like soldiers going to sleep at night, petting cats if you crouch or getting heatstrokes for staying in the desert for too long etc.

Cons

- Side Quests:
It's now time for the biggest con for Origins, the side quests. They are so so many, repetitive, lame side quests. It's the biggest turn off for me, taking me to an exaggerated 64 hours playtime, spanned across three long months. All of them are the same "bring me back x thing", "kill y general", "escort z", "follow n", the latter two of them being extremely annoying and simply pesky. After something like 20 of these quests I just skipped all lines of dialogue and rushed to the objectives. That's one of my main reasons for not recommending the game.

- Locations

The second main reason I didn't enjoy the game was the locations. I liked the viewpoints (even though there are FIFTY-EIGHT!!! of them in the game) and the Stone Circles, but I completely hated the animals lairs, loot treasure locations and rest places. Also there are so so so many boring level 1 outposts. At some point I grew tired of them and I just executed the captain with my bow and rushed to the treasure, ignoring any kind of strategy and stealth.

These are the main cons I encountered in the game. Other smaller cons are Aya and her boring character development and cringy final speeches, buggy and clunky movement, the horse riding, the irrelevant MD story, weapons getting useless after you get legendary stuff etc.

Conclusion

♥♥♥♥ ARTIFICIAL GAME LENGTHENERS!

Nobody can beat Assassin's Creed architectural history lessons, even if you're still just stabbing all and jumping out the window while you're sightseeing the entire timeline!

It's a title that every fan of the series should play.

The best generation in all of Assassin's Creed Collections! I have four reasons to support my view.

First of all, the combat system. In AC Origin the player should no longer fight like a God of War. The diverse enemy types have greatly limited the performance in battle of the player. An organized fortress will be a great threat to the player. A combat team with shield man and arrow man could easily kill the player with good ability of defense and ranged attack. The enemies are powerful and deadly that the player must eliminate some special types of enemies before contact. Conclusively speaking, the Assassin in Origin should behave like a Assassin, but not a warrior.

Second, more elements to explore in game. The story happened in Egypt and the map has been divided into several provinces. Each province is worthy spending over 4 hours to unlock all of the side-missions and explorable sites. The challenging arena awaits for the player to has his victory. there are at least 2 arenas to defeat. Every time the player hears the declaration: The siwa has his victory! All of the time he costs will be monumental moments. By the way, if your desire to unlock all of the achievements and complete all of the side-missions, you may spend estimated over 100 hours on this game.

Third, game control and animation. ACO has simplified the movement control. There is no sprint button or downward movement. Almost every wall in Egypt could be climbed even when its surface is slippery( Could that explain how the pyramid was built? ). The climbing animation of previous generations in AS collections made me egg-pain, but ACO is much better.

The last point, RPG elements are involved in this game. You could gain experience through killing enemies, hunting down boss for high-quality equips, upgrade your weapons with money or animal materials, that's an important part of this game.

Please leave some comments if you have any doubt with me. I might check the message when I leave the Animus (xd).

Assassin's Creed® Origins:
◻️ Good Stuff:
✅ Amazing storyline and graphics
✅ Very likeable atmosphere and characters
✅ Size of a map
✅ True historical events
✅ Game is full of adventures and fun
✅ Animals and secret places
✅ Photo mode
✅ Main quests
✅ Controls (climbing, running, fighting, etc..)
✅ Shooting precision and precision while assassinating
✅ Cut scenes, animations
✅ Building and character designs
✅ Main character [Bayek] (more about him later)
✅ Weapons, shops
✅ Nice soundtracks
✅ New animus update where you can create your own gamemode is absolutely perfect
🔹 Okay stuff:
⚠️ Some side quests are actually annoying and very long lasting which is pretty boring if you need to level up
⚠️ Some animations and places still have bugs and glitches
⚠️ This game doesn't have any special connection with real Assassin's Creed franchise and it doesn't feel like you are
really playing an Assassin's Creed game so game by itself is pretty good but it's not an AC at all
⚠️ The protagonist Bayek is some kind of a mix of Connor and Ezio which is also a bit disappointing because he is very
sanguinary, seems like person with no emotios but he actually has some, he only wants to kill to get what he wants
but also has a sense of humor, he cares about innocent people and he loves to help
⚠️ All difficulties are easy to play on except Nightmare where bosses are really hard to kill
⚠️ Crafting is getting harder from the time and it makes you buy tools for crafting later on
⚠️ Story was going great until the end which was pretty messed up and it could be a lot better
⚠️ Story has no emotions at all
◼️ Bad Stuff:
⛔️ You get huge FPS drops and lags in some places (like Alexandria for example) and setting graphics on lower doesn't
help, poor optimisation (not everywhere, it's not the same for everyone)

💜Game is amazing and it deservers 9/10. I recommend it and you should try, the expirience is awesome and worth your
time, not only that you can play a game, you can also learn history, also it is definitely better than Syndicate and Unity.💜

I am new to the world of Assassin's creed, not really knowing why I even bought this game (well except for being a history buff)
I finally completed the main storyline and the DLC's and as you can see it took it well over a 100 hours, mostly becuase I often got sidetracked with things to watch, experince and solve.
Since there is a lot to be said about this game, I will simply do a pro/con list maybe with some notes in the end. It does have good things in it

Pros:
- The map is HUGE, there are a ton of things to do and watch.
- The cutscenes are beautiful
- The main story is great (Though at times drawn out)
- I LOVE how I can control an arrow from the predator bow, just wish it had a longer reach
- I never get tired of the leap of faith
- A lot of playable hours in this game, more so that many others (Like Wolfenstein, only took me around 30 to complete)
- How can you not love gliding down a pyramid?
- Senu is awesome to help you get the lay of the land and mark targets throughout
- The amount of side quests are immense.
- For a first time AC player it was actually pretty cool.
- The fighting is easy to learn once you get the hang of it (and set your keyboard so it fits better, because the way it is set up at start is just insane, how are you to use one hand over the whole keyboard?)
- Did like the DLC The hidden ones as the main game does not give you closure to the relationship between Beyak and Aya, and The hidden ones also gives you the last tips to the origens of the brotherhood.


Cons:
- Many of the missions are fetch missions, and many, A LOT of them are the same, go kill that person, go find my stuff while killing this person.
- I experinced some gliches where a NPC stood in the way and would not move (like in a cage firing a arrow at nothing, but not moving, meaning I had to restart the game and the whole misison, AGAIN)
- Loadtime when fasttravelling between places far apart seems to take forever.
- Sadly the port to PC is not that great when playing with keyboard and mouse. You need a ton of keys just to control stuff.
- Some of the main story is really drawn out, having to kill off those of the acient order is just, well after the first 3 or 4 it gets repetative and you really just want to get it over with.
- Cameracontrol is one area they need to work on, often i stared into a rockface or a carpet, again showing that the port to PC is close to bad (or maybe I haven't played consols to tell if the same occurs there)
- Some areas needed more fast travelling points, one dessert didn't even have one, yet it was a desert the game forced you to return to again and again, tedius having to spend several minuts riding to get to the place.
- The leveling system does take a bit getting used to.
- Having to set your keyboard so it fits better, because the way it is set up at start is just insane, how are you to use one hand over the whole keyboard, that is just stupid.
- The DLC Curse of the pharoes is just.... Well a waste of time in my eyes.

On a note
it would have been great with a introduction to the gameplay, much I had to find out, with the help of Youtube, which shouldn't really have been nesessary. Ubisoft could have made it easier for newcomers to learn how the gamemechcanichs works, but instead you use hours to figure it out and figuring the best setting of the keyboard.

But still, despite the repetative nature of the game, I really loved just hanging around in the game, enjoying how they made ancient Egypt come to life.

Would I recommend you pay full price? Hell no, go find a good offer somewhere.

BIG NOTE:
Even though you buy the game on Steam you still need a UPlay account, which I stil haven't understood.

One of the best games I've recently played.

Being an history lover, I really enjoyed the AC games I played before this one, namely the first one and Black Flag, being historical playgrounds (especially Black Flag). But this is something else entirely.
It has ignited a genuine interest in this saga, so much that I definitely want to play all the main entries now.

AC Origins is an action RPG interpretation of the old AC formula, which was functional and interesting indeed, but clunky, slow, and in a desperate need of rejuvenation. So, how did they manage to do that? By simply taking inspiration from one of the best games ever, The Witcher 3.
The gameplay is finally smooth, fast, and more dynamic, and the emphasis on the RPG aspects and PG's skills development leads to different ways of playing the game from the older entries. You are first and foremost a Medjay, a warrior concept coming straight from the Old Kingdom of Egypt, and not an Assassin; the game then explains you the transition from a noble like warrior to the more complex identity of Hidden One, being a beautifully mastercrafted prequel for the AC saga.
The Ptolemaic Egypt setting is the icing on the cake. The environment in this game is absolutely brilliant, and you can really tell the Devs had fun crafting this game (along with the Curse of the Pharaohs DLC which is more focused on the myths and legends side of Egypt history). Bayek is a great and interesting character, especially thanks to Abubakar Salim, who did a flawless job giving him personality and depth.

Everything works 100% fine, except for one thing: the AI, and therefore the balance. AC games have never been difficult, but playing this on Nightmare difficulty was a total piece of cake. AI in general is pretty dumb, especially in the stealth sequences (if you decide to play stealth), and combat is fun but pretty damn easy. The only hard times are with higher level enemies that can kill you with one blow and are absolutely sponges, forcing you to calculate every move in order not to restart the whole sequence again.
Also, the whole microtransaction thing is, well, there, and if on one hand I despise microtransaction in a SP game, on the other hand I've never felt forced to buy exp boosts or anything else, and I bought absolutely nothing in the 204 hours of playthrough. Also, the game can be played by only following the main quest, or by doing all the secondary tasks scattered around the game world; I've never, never had to grind my way through, or do quests and stuff because of level gates in the main quest.

I really enjoyed this iteration of the AC franchise and I'm looking forward to play Odyssey. I want more of this!

I'm torn between a positive or negative rating. At the core, there is a great base here. There's a lot to see and do. But the more you play, the more the 'do' part is just copy and pasted content from other parts of the map. I fully understand that open world games have to utilize this aspect to some degree. But in this game, the repetitive content is just a huge bore. Infiltrate this base, kill this dude. That's the majority of missions in Origins.

It was really fun at the beginning exploding the pyramids, climbing them, exploring small towns and large cities, and even the open desert areas are fun too. I also like how you can climb any rock face.

But the game's issues come out to play quite early on, and they build up momentum until they are all you pay attention to. The AC series STILL cannot get down decent pedestrian AI. People do not move normally--they do not react normally nor do they interact with each other normally... or atleast acceptably. lip syncing is horrible, voice acting is mostly trash, and animations are largly unpolished. There is also a lack of weapon/gadget variety, memorable characters, unique weapons, etc.

Poor animations have really been bothering me in Origins recently. Watching a tiger attack another animal is cool in concept, but has never been executed properly in these games. AC games have had animals attacking eachother since AC3. Ubi has never been able to make the animations of these animals fighting eachother look even decent. It's embarassing to watch, especially now a days.

The forceful grinding aspect of this game is a tad insane too.

Story wise, I lost interest halfway through and just started skipping every cut scene because they are a huge bore. I just wanted to finish the story. Maybe, I thought, the ending would be cool. Cutscene wise throughout the game: their production values are weak, lip syncing is really bad, and again: ANIMATIONS are wonky, unstable and unpolished.

I'm ripping on this game hard--I know. There is a lot of good in Origins. I'm just frustrated that Ubi has not improved on pedestrain AI and overall animation quantity and quality. These are TOUGH things to get down-they take a lot of resources, but are so worth it. IMO.

Assassins Creed Origins is ultimately a step in the right direction for the franchise, but has a LOT of issues that are hard to look past as I reflect on my time playing the game.

PRO'S

- Easily one of the better Open worlds for a game in years, possibly even all time.

- Graphics. Man this game is gorgeous to look at ( except fire, boy did they really ♥♥♥♥ up fire ), combined with the excellent world design, it's easy to see why they added in Discovery Mode.

- Performance. I honestly expected a lot worse from a Ubisoft PC port, but surprisingly I was able to hold 60 fps at Ultra with my 970.

- Very good sound design. Mainly for weapons, animals, and everything else that isn't voice acting.

- Decent sound track. Nothing too memorable aside from the main theme, but at least it never took me out of the experience.

CON'S
( SPOILERS )

- Main Story. Unfortunately the story is one of the worst I've played through in recent memory. Initially I was sort of interested and thought ok lets see where this goes, and...... it blows. By the end of it all I couldn't really give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about Bayek, Aya, their son, or really any of the other "characters" if you can even call them that. Cleopatra's character was just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad, her voice actress sounded like she was falling asleep. Apollodorus sucks, who cares that he dies. Bayeks character is all over the place. They couldn't decide if they wanted him to be serious, or charming, or funny, so they tried to do all of them, and it's just so so so bad. He often has weird out of character moments where he's overly emotive for the context of the scene, either sounding too angry or happy. (maybe this was an issue with the voice actor?). The writing is just so amatuerish, I don't know how they thought anyone would enjoy this. Bayeks character arch is irrational, and unsatisfying. Also, what was the point of Aya in general really? The romance between them is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ uninteresting. They had zero chemistry, it was like watching a high school play of Romeo and Juliet. Also, why the ♥♥♥♥ didn't we get to see Cleopatra get assassinated??? That's one of the original things people expected to see in an Egyptian Assassins creed going back to AC2. Instead we get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ scene where Aya lamely threatens Cleopatra and boom, that's it, that's the game, oh cool, guess we're all "Assassins" now. The modern day segments were equally as random and pointless as the rest of the game, and added absolutely nothing to the overall story. I could go on and on about how bad the main story was, but if you buy this expecting to experience a unique story that intertwines with the history of Egypt and the great historical figures of the time, then look elsewhere. The story gets a 2/10 from me.

- Side quests. Now usually with open world rpg's, even if the main story is ♥♥♥♥, you can usually find a few side quests that really stick with you, and can sometimes make the game worthwhile. Welp, not with AC Origins. The side quests in this game literally, and I do mean literally, could not be worse. There is NOTHING of substance here. This game is honestly one of the worst examples "fetch this, kill that, clear this place" I've ever seen. It's all just rince and repeat.

- Combat. I have mixed feelings about the combat, and it had some potential, but it just wasn't done right here in my opinion. They went for a more "Skill" based system with what is essentially Dark Souls Lite. Despite the changes, it still ended up being awkwardly as simple and button mashy as the older combat systems, with no real thought required, and even less animations than the older games, resulting in you seeing the same kill move 1,000 times by the end of the game. I ended up just sticking with Bows and the Hidden Blade mostly to avoid the pointless drawn out fights that you know you'll win anyway.



Overall I decided to give the game a positive rating because I spent more time having fun exploring Egypt than I did rolling my eyes and cringing at the dialogue. It's a cool game in a lot of ways, and although I essentially called the story a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥, I recommend it to anyone looking to blow time in a gorgeous open world.

6.5/10

The game's good. Ubisoft connect sucks ♥♥♥♥. Everybody is vocal about loathing these middle accounts between the game launcher and the game and yet they're still here making me log in every single time and not remembering my account details. Top stuff.

After playing every Assassins Creed game until Origins, I can say this one is truly a masterpiece and one of the best games of the series, being really close to the Ezio story games quality IMO.

The world of the Ancient Egypt is really well detailed and very imersive, even if there's not a big variety on the NPC's models. The monuments, caves, tombs and all of what you'd expect of Egypt are beautifully represented in the game, and being able to explore them is really like time travelling. The feeling of roaming around the desert is really something, and always a jaw breaking moment when you see all those random events that occur there.

The story of the game is one of the best in the series aswell, it tells really well how the Creed was born, what drove this group of people to gather and spread in the fight for freedom of the Templars tyranny. The main characters are very well made with really distinct and strong character. Aya and Bayek are for sure two of the best characters of the series.

The expansions DLCs are also worth the buy. The Hidden Ones gives you a more in-depht sight into how the Creed was born and how it worked on it's early times. The Curse of the Pharaos focuses more on the Egyptian mythology, where you can visit and explore 4 places of the Duat, each with beautifull sceneries and that will make just stay there and use Photo mode for hours.

With the game, you can also find a Tour Mode, which is like a virtual museum of the Ancient Egypt with information about EVERYTHING you want or need to know about how ancient egyptians lived and what their beliefs, mythology and style of life were, and more. It's a complete delight for everyone who's passionate about Egypts history and wants to know more about it, and at the same time, have a visual sense of how things were instead of just reading stuff from a book.

If you're a fan of Assassins Creed, this is a must buy. If you're an RPG fan, this is a must buy. If you like games with history, and you are interested in this setting, this is a must buy!

I recommend getting the Gold Edition, so you can have the full experience of Assassins Creed Origins.

i7 7700k
GTX 1070 Overclocked to 2000MHz
32 GB or RAM
Playing on a 7200 RPM HDD
Playing on ultra at 1440p

So are reading a lot of these reviews and seeing people saying that they are getting poor frame rates and drops I decided to write this. I as well was getting these frame drops in game (45-50 FPS). I found a solution however, becuse I was overclocking my GPU i was keeping an eye on my frequency and I notices that the frame drop would always happen at the same time as a frequency drop. From what I could tell this was an issue with the cards power management. It will drop below base clock to save power when it is not in heavy use.

You can fix this in the nvidia control panel under power management.

So over all I think that this is a really interesting game. It is not at all like the other AC titles. It has many elements from the witcher a game that I love. Overall I would recommend this game if you are a long time AC fan or if you are new to the series.

I don't usually write reviews, but I think this game deserves a lot of praise.

If you disliked the recent Assassins Creed and Far Cry titles for their mindnumbingly dull, "vast as an ocean, deep as a puddle" open worlds, then give this a shot. It's a nice change of pace. There's a lot of emphasis on exploring the environment, thereby making the game less linear. Think Black Flag's sea-exploration, but on land.

The developers of this game seemed to take a lote of inspiration from the Witcher 3, which is fine by me. Some ways they've done this is through meaningful sidequests, a lot of detail to the environment, a pretty fun crafting system, and the previously mentioned quality of exploration.

The combat is fun and engaging; it feels like a mix between Witcher 3 and For Honor. Dark Souls players might not like that, as they would say it's "too easy"--which is fair--but relative to previous Assassins Creed titles, it's a big improvement. Gone are the days of waiting to press one button to counter and kill.

I can't write too much else, as at the time of making this I've only played about ten hours (and spent a large chunk of that time upgrading my character's gear). However, it's been a surprisingly wonderful experience. All in all, the game feels like a proper, spiritual continuation of the original Assassins Creed games--and by that I mean before things started going down hill.

Ladies and gentlemen, now I would like to share about my experiences with gameplay in this AAA game. After completing some mission, I just want to say the world of Egypt is sooooo big and fantastic wow. Ride the horse and camel to explore the very big world and reveal some unknown secrets, it was very enjoyable to me. After playing Origin, I want to say thanks to Ubisoft Montreal cuz they let me recognize how the Egypt world look like and it's traditional and cultural and I even think about want to travel in Egypt in future. Although I am first timer of AC games but Origin is really a cool game, what a masterpiece. Now I would like to summarize everything on this AAA game.

Pros:
1) Combat system in Origin is different from previous Ac games since I also did play them, especially AC2, Brotherhood and Blackflag etc. Besides, it require you to use the tactical strategy when you deal with enemies and infiltrate the enemies' posts. Just reminder, dont be too rush during battle and commencing the mission. Another thing is combat system is little like Dark souls, did you noticed that?
2) The world and map of Egypt is really big. You can enjoy yourself when travelling in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ world.
3) There are a lot of main and side missions.
4) Video graphics look so nice.
5) This game has Steam achievement.

Cons:
1) PC keybinding is not so friendly. I still need time to adopt and memorize it, sometime I did press wrong key accidentally when doing mission. I need the Xbox controller very very bad.
2) Hmmm nothing more, that's it.

Although I havent complete the gameplay and also havent start to play DLC yet, but it already worth the money. Furthermore, AC Oddysey will be released in Oct 2018. If you are interested, you can go pre-purchase it then. I give the overall mark to Origin, 9/10. I hope you guys can enjoy my review, have a great day. Thank you for spending the time to read it.

If you wanna know more about ancient Egypt please download the game and check out the Discovery Tour section. It's very detailed and very informative. I appreciate the time and effort the devs have put into researching about Ancient Egypt.
I would totally recommend this game to anyone interested in the history of Egypt.

AC Origins is a game that saved the franchise. This game is an ambitious sequel that changed many aspects of AC.
Ratings out of 10:

+Graphics: 10
Simply beautiful.

+Soundtracks: 8.5
Great soundtracks that give off ancient Egyptian vibes.

+Story (Main Quests): 7
The story was fairly good and it did a decent job showing the origins of the Assassins Brotherhood. The only negative side is that they could've added more content near the end. Likewise, I did not like how the ending (SPOILER ALERT) was centered around Aya more than the main protagonist Bayek.

+Content (Side Quests & Locations): 9
This part is what really makes this game special. It has loads of things to do even after you finish the main story. The side quests are actually very interesting and have a lot of variety. there are many different locations to discover, but at some point discovering these locations becomes a little bit repetitive. However, I absolutely loved the exploring the tombs and the pyramids.

+Gameplay (Movement, Controls, etc.): 9
Another strong side of the game. The gameplay is fun and gives the player a challenge at the same time. There are many interesting abilities to unlock and many diffrent types of battles, such as the gladiator arena, the hippodrome, sea battles, etc.

Conclusion: 9/10
Definitely pick up this game especially if it's on sale.

Assassin's Creed Origins is a good game with a lot of content! You can explore vast areas of Egypt in the open world with plenty of side quests, locations, puzzles, and many more fun areas. It even comes with the Discovery tour as a free update, which is the history mode to learn about ancient Egyptian life and culture.

Pros:
- Vast and beautiful open world with lots of locations
- Lots of side quests
- Fun combat and stealth mechanics
- Good length story
- Discovery tour

Cons:
- The story isn't very good in the sense that the start and end feel rushed but the bits in between are good
- I found that the content can get a little repetitive if you want to 100% on every location

Verdict:
The game offers a ton of good content that is overall an enjoyable experience. If not willing to spend the full price wait for a sale, but definitely worth a play, especially if you love open world games.

Cons

-Some times Easy mode feels hard
-NEW CONTROL FOR FIGHTING NO COUNTER SYSTEM (Not a con but takes time to get used to it)

First of all, this game really is’t anything like the previous AC games. It has a different and imo a better combat system: you can dodge attacks, you can parry attacks what makes your enemies defenseless, you can attack with either a light attack or a heavy attack. Eg. There are some fat dudes in the game with giant shields, you’ll need a fully charged heavy attack to break trough their defenses. You also have a bow multiple kinds of bows. Which makes stuff interesting. You also have an eagle that you can use to scan the area for enemies and chests and prisoners. (You also have your eagle vission) There will be horse combat aswell since you can call your personal mount anytime.

Except for AC Odyssey, this game has the biggest map for sure. Even when you walk in your home village at the start of the game, you can see that the creators put a lot of effort in the map. It is very detailled and beautifull. Just for the “discovery tour” you should play the game. (A mode so you can see the map) You also have “fast travel locations” who allow you to travel the map very fast once you’ve unlocked them.

The storyline is great but at the same time bad. Let me explain: in Origins you have 2 important caracters: Bayek and his wife. They are both extremly good warriors and Medjays (protectors of Egypth) their son gets killed by the “order of ancients” (your main enemy in the game). And they are looking for revenge, almost half of the main quests will exist out of hunting down members of the order. This really made me lose interest in the storyline. But they really fixed that once you’re done hunting them down. Then the storyline gets really good! Even though the storyline had his ups and downs, it was still better than almost every other AC games. Mainly because it didn’t exist out of “kill .....”. Though the main story was sick, the DLC’s are even more amazing.

Side missions: They are fun at the start, but when you’ve done a few you will lose interest in them. Trust me. There are a ♥♥♥♥ ton of sude quests tho, so if you wanne 100% the game, you’ll need a lot of time.

Unknown locations: when you travel trough the map, you’ll see locations with objectivs like bandit camps or fortresses. You can complete them for XP but they don’t have anything to do with the story. Just like side quests it will get boring when you’ve done a few.

Hunting: when you travel trough the map, you will meet a lot of wild animals for sure. (Lions, hippo’s, cheeta’s, crocodiles, ...) they will attack you! But there will also be animals who won’t attack you. You can kill thos animals for resources which you will need to upgrade your armor, your hidden blade and stuff like that.

Inventory: This is the place where you will be upgrading your hidden blade and armor. This will also be the place where you equip your weapons, shields, bows you either loot or buy.

Weapons: You havr multiple kinds of weapons like: swords, spears, duel daggers, maces, ... each of them has a different kind of combat style. They come in different tiers, legendary is stronger than rare for example. They can also have special abillities. There is a fire sword for example. You can get legendary weapons from a special trader for a lot of drachmen (currency used in the game) or from killing phylakes. (Bounty hunters trying to kill you, These are the STRONGEST enemies in the game.)

Leveling: there is a leveling system in the game. So when you see an enemy 5 levels higher, your skills don’t matter. You’ll die, even on easy mode. This means you’ll need to upgrade your weapons to keep using them or they will be too weak. This requires resources and drachmen. You can only upgrade your weapons at a smid. You can get resources by dismanteling weapond you don’t use.!

Special abilities: when you level up you get 1 skillpoint. Which you can use to unlock abilities like: shield rush (you run to an enemy with your shield znd break their defense), regen ability, ...

IMPORTANT: You need a GOOD GAMING PC/Laptop!!

Best representation of Egypt in a video game.

Captivating characters, groundbreaking world + exploration and pretty good story telling.

Some areas are level-locked which is frustrating.

If you want to just skip the grind and blaze through the story-line, there is an option to boost your level early on. Do not recommend this as the world is beautiful and worth exploring at your own pace.

Overview
In Assassin’s Creed Origins, players assume the role of Bayek of Siwa, and discover the origins of the assassin’s brotherhood. Throughout your journey, you meet with several historical figures such as Cleopatra and Julius Caesar. You journey through the country of Egypt in 49BC, crossing many historical landmarks and famous cities such as Alexandria. Egypt comprises of a variety of biomes, ranging from deserts to lush forests. Journey through this fascinating land and change the course of history.

Pros:
Visually stunning.
Easy to learn combat.
Decent exploration with occasional surprises.
Great narrative and protagonist.
Great soundtrack.

Cons:
Points of Interests around the map might feel a little repetitive.
The main story starts off at a good pace but near the end it starts to jump from point A to B.

Rating: Great

In-Depth Breakdown

World and Exploration
The world of AC Origins is filled sprawling towns, forests and long stretches of deserts. There are many points of interests ranging from military encampments to ancient temples. Exploration is mostly done on foot, (water bodies are explored on boats, of course) but you also have your horse/camel that you can call whenever.

Water bodies are filled with hippos and crocodiles to kill while the forests sprawl with animals like hyenas, lions, deer, etc. Deserts are mostly filled with hidden ancient tombs, which almost always contain a small environmental puzzle of some sort. In cities you may find military encampments and temples. There are military encampments in the deserts too.

There are many historical landmarks such as Krokodilopolis, Bent Pyramid, Cyrene, Library of Alexandria, Giza, Memphis, Great Sphinx of Giza, Nitria.

While exploring, look out for loot, which is literally everywhere.

There is fast travel.

Scouting
Scouting is done using your trusty eagle, Senu. Senu can help you spot threats, treasures, hidden entrances, resources, etc.

Side Quests
AC Origins if full of quests all over it’s world. There are the typical fetch quests and kill x amounts of people quests but they don’t come up that often and generally have a small story attached with them. Overall, the side quests in AC Origins are interesting, mostly unique, sometimes funny, sometimes depressing, but only a handful which are actually memorable.

Inventory Management
You carry the following items on you: melee weapons, shields, bows, tools, outfits and mounts.

There are different kinds of melee weapons: regular swords, dual swords, sickle swords, heavy blades, heavy blunts, spears and scepters. You can initially equip one melee weapon but an ability allows you to equip two at a time.

There are four types of bows:
1) Hunter Bows: average speed, strength and range.
2) Warrior Bows: Fires a spread of multiple arrows, kind of like a shotgun, which makes them lethal up close and personal.
3) Light Bows: They can fire multiple arrows before needing to “reload”, they are kind of like an SMG.
4) Predator Bows: Slow but the most powerful, deals great amounts of damage if you can land a headshot, they can be compared to sniper rifles.
Just like melee weapons, you can initially equip one bow but an ability allows you to equip two at a time.

There are various kinds of tools like sleep darts, poison darts, firebombs, smokescreens and some more.

Outfits and mounts only differ cosmetically and have no impact on stats in any way.

There are also six basic components (like tools bag, chest plate, quiver) which you can upgrade using various resources found all over the world.

Combat
Combat in AC Origins feels fluid, animations flow nicely, controls don’t feel wonky and the parry and shield block systems work fine. Unlike previous releases, AC Origins uses a hitbox system for it’s combat, so hitting multiples enemies with one swing is possible.

Combat can be hard when playing on harder difficulties and especially so when the level difference between you and the enemy is more than about five levels. There seems to be a soft cap that just doesn’t allow you to do as much damage to an enemy more than 5 levels above you. Enemies also seem to swarm you and act like individuals rather than a group, so they don’t just stand behind while one of them fights you, awaiting their turn.

Stealth
Memorising enemy petrol patterns, positioning yourselves accordingly, and then striking from the shadows is the kind of stealth in this game. You pass through enemy camps while remaining crouched in tall grass, whistle to attract nearby enemies towards you, and then stick you hidden blade through them. Stealth in AC Origins is very forgiving and is very easy to get into.

Abilities
There is really not much to say about abilities. There are abilities relating to increasing the amount of experience earned from performing certain actions, abilities improving your melee and ranged weapons, like allowing you to control the shot of your predator arrow mid-air. Abilities allow you to unlock the various tools, second slots for melee and ranged weapons. There are other kinds of abilities aswell.

Final Thoughts
Overall, Assassins Creed Origins is an excellent open-world RPG that brings new mechanics to the series while remaining true to it’s roots. Gameplay is well thought out and fluid. It took me 101 hours to finish the game on Normal Difficulty, while exploring the whole map thoroughly and completing everything the game has to offer. I also managed to achieve 100% achievements in a single playthrough. I can recommend buying at a discount.

I've been playing AC games since 2008, My favorite will always be AC2 with the story that it has.

I just started the game, of course it has several issues, a few noticable bugs, 2 crashes...etc.

However. The world is Beautiful
Combat is Fluid
Climbing is Fluid
Map seems huge

I will update this review when i finish the game and go into more detail. so far a positive


=============== UPDATE 2 ===================================

I have Finished the Game. The First update is below if you would like to Read it.

The game starts off Interesting, the more you play the better it gets, the game grows on you and pulls you into the story, you do a few side missions and some of them hook you in.

The Story only gets better as you play. I started Loving the story after level 25 - 30

(POTENTIAL SPOILERS: Getting out of the animus was a good experience, im glad the story there is still relevant. Meeting Desmonds dad again was heartwarming, the story has a good direction now. View any memories of anyone is now a thing. opens a lot of potential)

I wish they Brought back some old Mechanics from old AC's, Like pushing people out of the way, taking cover behind walls, being able to switch to your Hidden blade and use that as a weapon, Daggers, and so on.

This game is a new starting point of AC, and i hope it improves on it. I hope they add what was good and improve what is bad.



Pros:

Great Visuals
Big Open World
A lot of content (And Upcoming DLC and Events)
Combat is new and Interesting
RPG Elements
Good Story

Cons:

Bugs, Glitches, Visual Glitches, Crashes
Nothing Mechanically new for Assassins Creed (by that i mean the Climbing is the same and or downgraded for the most part, you can climb ANYTHING you want but the climbing was better in AC Brotherhood, AC Unity)
Grinding


Overall this game is a 8/10 For Me. If the Climbing and Movement were improved, Animations were better, Microtransactions removed, this game could have a been a 9/10 or a solid 10/10 for me.

Its not the BEST AC game ever. buts its the best Since AC4.

Worth the money.

Before I start with the review, I want to share my familiarity with the Assassin's Creed franchise:



The game did not hook me up at the beginning. The combat felt strange especially with the M/KB controls. The characters felt generic and the story did not feel like an AC game, but after about 4 hours I started to warm up for the game.

Bayek of Siwa (the main protagonist) started to grow on me. His quest and passion for justice started to become your own, thanks to the immersive world. The new characters introduced to the world were authentic and Bayek's character development made him more and more relatable. My peak was around the questline, where your own blood starts to boil because of the injust you have been witnessing.
Old Egypt is portrayed quite nicely and authentic with a lot of intresting side quests to do and mysteries to unravel, though I can't tell you how historicaly accurate the game is.

Sadly the game starts to feel rushed towards the end. Another negative is the optimisation: As I said the M/KB controls feel strange but you get used to it, but you do not get used to the constant stuttering and frame drops this game has. I recommend everyone to use the Vulkan based implementation of DirectX (DXVK), thanks to that modification you can run this game with higher frames and better stability, but this is still not an excuse for not delivering an update with proper optimisation.

My progression with the game is at 72%, where I stopped playing after finishing the main quest, which required me to play about 40 hours.

I definitly recommend the game, even for someone who is only familiar with the old gameplay of the Assassin's Creed franchise, but I would not buy the complete edition without trying out the game first.
I have the addons for the game, but I did not touch them yet, because I currently feel exhausted of this game.

I didn't want to listen to some of the post. But i have to agree, that this game is not optimized and crashes. I have two machines that go above and beyond in meeting the specs and this game just wont run well and crash. Not wasting my time an rather go back to games that just work, I was excited to play this and i am sure the game is great, but just a bad PC port.

Best Assassin's Creed of the series for me. Never has a game pulled me in like this one did.
It has good, diverse side quests.
A huge map that is detailed very well. Characters who you love right from the start such as Bayek and his friend known as H. Bayek is in my opinion on the same level as Ezio with his personality. He is on a revenge mission but never gives up the opportunity to smile. Great with kids. Funny as well, but becomes serious if the situation calls for it. Another thing that i love is the combat system. It's very similar to the Witcher 3 combat as well as dark souls and quite challenging. You are able to have a variety of weapons like spears, axes, sword and shield, and sickle swords. You can also upgrade any weapon you find and if you really like its design, then you can upgrade it to your level. The crafting system is superb and you can get materials either by hunting for them with your companion S, or by taking down military convoys. The story is interesting and will pull you in easily. Did i mention that you can clinb almost anything now including mountains, walls, and other structures. Their are tombs and other caves scattered across the map with treasure in them. One problem that people have had is the game not working well with their system. I recommend having a good processor as well as a decent gpu ( like an i7 and a 970+). For reference, i have an i7 6700k and a gtx 970 and i reckon that i'm getting ~60 fps on high preset with my resolution being 1080p. There are 3 difficulties in the game: easy, medium, and hard. I recommend that you play on hard because I feel that hard difficulty makes for the best experience. I'm sorry if i made any grammatical errors. I rate this game a 10/10. You can ask me any questions.

Game runs incredibly poorly, caused max CPU usage, feels like it was rushed out the gate then allowed a few more months to be polished.
Hopefully they fix the problems with a patch but now its the same old Ubisoft story for PC gamers.

Good Fried Chicken Recipe:

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce (optional, for added flavor), salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Add in chicken pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours.
When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees.
Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly.
Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess.
Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.
Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving.

The best Assassin´s Creed in years. Maybe the masterpiece of the series.

Very impressive how big and detailed the old Egyptian land is.
Good and interesting storyline, a character that becomes more and more sympathetic as more as you play.
Very stable framerate - even highly maxed out (but make sure you can run it before you buy it).
What I like most is the golden / yellow / bright colour scheme.
A game for long, dark winter nights.
This just makes me happy.
The new combat gameplay is very fun and so much superior to the old titles of the series.
The running and jumping, still feels casual - since you only press one button - but I can live with it.
This is the closest we will get to a real new Prince of Persia.
RPG elements are great too, since I love level exp up. Very motivating. Great perks and skills too.
So much to collect, new weapons, upgrading equipment, etc. Very motivating.
I like that they took some of the major elements from Horizon Zero Dawn, one of my favourite PS4 games of all times.
Overall, a very impressive piece of software. So much AAA title. And actually I am happy that Ubisoft still brings games like this to the PC.
I play it with 3D vision in compatibility mode, which runs fine for me - use the AC Unity profile for this.
The picture mode is so cool.
Better than expected. Overwhelmed by its beauty.
This could be the first AC that I actually finish.

Very much recommended. Full price worth.

The great:
+ Graphics
+ Environment looks spectacular
+ The detailing in everything from large structures, small objects, to armaments and clothing
+ Missions are by and large fun and interesting
+ Discovery mode for bigger historical insight
+ Great regional variety for an area that might not be thought of as having much variety (people usually think just the desert and the Nile), from the black and white deserts, Greek and Egyptian villages and cities, the big Nile, oasis, delta marshes, mountains and more.
+ Many hours of gameplay if you decide to experience all there is to offer
+ A variety of enemies (and I'm not counting the simple reskins between Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Bandits). Spearmen, Archers, Rogues, Axe-men, Sword and shield, Officers, Brutes, Priests (Ushabti), and probably more I can't remember
+ The music is parts great and parts ok. It is very fitting for the atmosphere of the game, but gets tedious in the fighting

The ok:
The historical figures you meet are sort of dumbed down a bit to fit the story agenda (powerhungry enemies, paragons of virtue allies).
The story and quests are overall interesting, and if it gets too tedious there is always some temple or bandit camp nearby to explore

The not so great:
- Even years later the game will crash on some rare occasion. I'm assuming it's usually because of graphics in fast moving scenes (like fighting)
- The very black and white, right and wrong, attitude towards the story. It's usually as simple as "soldier... bad.. must.. kill..."
- A fair few quests could have been dropped that were too boring and simple
- Reactions to the controls can often get annoying, like the all too familiar jumping to your death instead of the pillar you wanted.
- Some achievements are known to still be buggy, but obtainable.
- Combat is so and so. I could really do without the forced cinematic killings that draws out the fight. Especially a cinematic when the guy you're stabbing for several seconds while the both of you are in flames by the jar that broke right before the cinematic.

Beautiful open world with an amazing storyline and cool cutscenes. Each character is unique and important to storyline. The new ancient Egypt theme really works and the new combat system is really great. This game also has great graphics and pretty well optimisation.

Overall, this game is a must play for any Assassin’s Creed fan...

One of the best games I've ever played. Amazing story, brilliant characters, huge map, lots to do, doesn't get repetitive. DLC adds even more quests. Can easily spend over 100 hours. Probably currently the best looking PC game

Main Story : Thumbs Up ( Including 2 dlcss)
Locations : Perfect and Beautiful (Especially the curse of Pharoas )
Rpg Elements : Praise worthy
Bayek's Voice Acting : The best of the best
Side quests : Average and mostly repetitive but crucial for level ups
AC origins is a good game for every RPG lover. The developers have properly painted the image of egypt and its people. Combat is pretty good and easy too. The origin story of the creed would not disappoint AC fans who loves RPG games. The game takes a bit of grinding to level up (since it's an rpg) and follow the main quests. Overall, Definitely Playworthy.

If you like ancient Egyptian mythology and history, this game is for you. Even if you aren't really a fan of AC games. The RPG elements are light but nice. The map is a decent size for an open world that doesn't feel empty, even with it's mass desert expanses, there are always tombs to solve, camps to clear, etc. Overall probably the best AC game I've played since AC2.

I disliked odyssey, it tried to be this game but twice as big and it didn't really work imo.
Bayek and Aya's story is intriguing and interesting and keeps you wanting to play.

The side quests can be a bit fetch questy here and there, but honestly most just build on the world around you and are great fun regardless.

I liked it, 9/10

Assassin creed origin is the comeback of the legendary series.
"Watching marvel's ' moon knight ' and playing this game on the same day and after sleep i m in Egypt playing as a bayek but wearing a suit of "MOON KNIGHT". Sleeping is THE ANIMUS for me now a days.
I’m a long time assassins creed fan, just wandering around exploring Egypt in very beautiful environment.
In short, I greatly recommend this game, not just to assassins creed fans, but fans of open world rpgs in general.
In conclusion, if you want to be immersed in Ancient Egypt, if you want to spend dozens of hours surrounded by Egyptian and Roman culture, people and more, now you can. If you've ever wanted to fight off bandits near the Pyramids of Giza and then loot the tomb, now you can. There's dozens of tasks to do in this game, from defeating enemy camps, naval combat, exploring, looting, hunting, you name it. Just please check it out, you won't regret it.

I just finished 100% completion on the main campaign, and both DLCs and was thoroughly satisfied. I've been playing the AC series since the beginning, only missing a few in the series, and this one is, by far, the best (I have not yet started Odyssey).

Gameplay:
This game has elements of Far Cry with the fortress assaults and Witcher 3 with the various landmarks on the map containing miniature objectives. The quests are all fully scripted and many of them are creative. Combat was much more interesting than past entries and the variety of weapons allows you to play the style of combat that you like. Most of the fortresses are designed to allow you multiple strategies for infiltrating them. You can go in with straight up combat, assassinate from the shadows, or pick off enemies one by one with your bow. The mild level-up "RPG" elements were nice and gave you extra incentive to run around completing the miscellaneous objectives. While many of the entries in the series had a lot of tedious filler (collect 100 hidden crosses, etc.), I never really felt that way about this one, despite a few recurring themes in the miscellaneous objectives.

Setting:
I have always been fascinated with Ancient Egypt and this game makes you feel like you're actually there as you wander around the cities and villages. Discovering the pyramids your first time is really exciting and the graphics provide plenty of breathtaking views. And just when you think you've seen enough of deserts and egyptian masonry, you start to discover other biomes and certain other architectural styles which I won't spoil for you. The first DLC (Hidden Ones) just is more of the same (and rather short), but the Curse of the Pharoahs really strikes out into new territory. If you can get it at a discount, get them both.

Overall, this is one of the best games I've played since Witcher 3. My only gripes are pretty minor. Several of the quests require you to follow someone who walks very slowly. I've gotten stuck following these people as they slowly walk across the city because I decided to launch the quest at the wrong time of the day. It's very annoying, but fortunately rare. Also, inventory management can be a pain. While there is a shortcut to sell all junk, some quests actually require that you collect certain "junk" items, so you generally want to avoid using this. Selling items line by line is tedious and time consuming. But these are very minor complaints in what is otherwise a fantastic game. Highly recommended!

Great game, I love it so much that I hate it.

It has been a while since a game put so emotional strains on me, I'm forcing myself to continue playing the main story.
Maybe because it hits me home in every way, from the romantic relationship between the married couple we play as to all the political and authoritarian corruption and oppression bestowed upon the Egyptians from the ancient times to this day.

This is one of the best in the series. Well-written story and some memorable characters, the world is amazing and combat/stealth are challenging. This game had me literally going into my brother's room just to say "I'm Bayek of Siwa" and then leaving.

After spending almost 200hrs on Assassin's creed Odyssey and 41hrs on Origins, I can tell that I love Origins more. As a previous installment in the franchise, it surpisingly plays better, but also does something worse.
The atmosphere. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the overall locations, landscapes and architectures in this game are so good. Every cites feel alive and interesting to explore. Enemy locations like camp and fort are fresh and not boring everytime u encounter one. The pyramids are magnificent. I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love it when u ride your mount in the desert and watch the sand dune shimmer.
Level design and gameplay. This is simply there are more heights in this game, so it provides better condition for stealth. And thank God, u can assassinate people and get a 1 shot headshot with your bow. Like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in Odyssey, I can't kill a 2 levels lower heavy guard on normal difficulty, but here in Origins I play on hard and I can oneshot a heavy guard on the same level with a hunting bow. For captain juse use predator bow. This is also 1 thing I like in Origins. Because there are no abilities like in Origins, every types of bow feel different and unique. If u want to go stealth, hunter and predator bow are better choice. For combat, use warrior and light bow. But this is also a two-edged sword. It make combat feels boring because u don't have ablities. In combat, u can just dodge/parry while attacking. U can do a overpower attack if u have your adrenaline full (there are some enhancements for it in skill tree), but that's it. Also archer in this game is extremely annoying. Their arrows fly so fast, almost hit scan and they hurt a lot.
Now for the worst part, the shield system. Holy mother ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ why in god's name do I have to press a button to get in shield mode, and then another button to parry? This is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad because in the heat of combat, it's hard to know if u are in shield mode or not. I got killed a lot early game because I only press the parry button when not in shield mode yet. Even now I'm not really used to it. And another thing. The lock on camera is bad. Sometime when lock on enemy it will just lock me on the current scene for a few seconds while my enemy move away. I have to unlock, look at him again and lock om again. Sometimes I have to do it a couple times and and it is annoying.
Quest. I really enjoy sidequests and npcs in this game. They are very interesting. Most of the sidequest are long, usually takes 2-3 phases. And they are connected to each others. A sidequest will open another one that continue the previous quest, and after the whole chain of quest u feel like u have achived something, not like in Odyssey where most of its sidequests are just filled quests.
Story wise, I haven't finished it yet so I can't really have a final opinion, but for now I like it. In Origins u seek revenge but also for a bigger purpose.
The crafting system. Holy mother of god it is so bad. It is so tedious because the amount of materials u get from hunting and exploring is absurd. Grinding level is already long enough, grinding materials for crafting is even longer.
Some minor things. I love the way they make bows in this game. They are unique but most importantly, they are huge. U feel strong, powerful using a bow. In Odyssey bows are to small. One bad thing. There is no option to hide HUD in photo mode. In order to do it, u will have to afk for a few second and it will automatically hide. However this is bugged and sometimes it won't work. This has been a problem since day one and ubisoft doesn't gave a single ♥♥♥♥ about it.

This Assassin's Creed ranks really high and, for me, is along the line of a Black Flag. You do not get the naval battle like in Black Flag but the exploration and feeling of freedom is huge. The main character is very charismatic and keeps you going. The scenery is absolutely amazing. I spent over 100 hours and, for a while, was just spending time finding stuff instead of actually following the story line. Most of the side quest are interesting and there is plenty of things to find. Now, the performance is good but it is a very demanding game. Running a GTX 1070 and Nvidia surround, I was maxing it out on high setting (not counting my old FX 8 cores was maxed out). The skill tree is pretty good although some skills are pointless. My biggest issue is the upgrade system for the gears. Unless you have the DLCs, you will not be able to upgrade some gears to the maximum as some material required is only available in the DLCs. The store system is not the best and also, you cannot generate money like in some of the other Assassin's Creed. So upgrading can be long. In regards to the main story line, it is very good and will keep you busy. Now, the DLC is a bit different. The first DLC, the Hidden Ones is very well done and makes sense. The Curse of the Pharaoh is a bit disjointed, especially towards the end where the whole quest system is sending you all over the place to finish one main quest. Overall, one of the best and refreshing Assassin's Creed on the market. One more thing, all achievements are feasible and do not require you to do three flips in the air and shoot an enemy in the head while holding something else.

I love the Assassin's Creed franchise and play it religiously, but after Syndicate I was honestly scared for its future. That game had the most hideous story I had the displeasure of playing in an AC game. Bad writing, bad characters, everything was shallow and uninteresting. It was an all-time low.
But this...

This is insanely good. Story. Characters. Setting. Gameplay.

They revamped the formula of the AC games. It is still the open world parkour game we know and love, but now it has a twist: It's now more gameplay-focused, instead of being cinematic. it also has many new RPG elements.
It's still similar enough that old players of the franchise will still like and different enough so that people who previously didn't enjoy the AC series may like this one.

Now to talk about a few things worth noting:

The map! The world of AC Origins, which is mainly Egypt in the end of the Ptolomaic line, with a few bits of Rome and later on egyptian afterlives, is insanely large, detailed and beautiful. Breathtaking, to say the least.

♥♥♥♥ ton of side quests! They bring depth to the giant world AC Origins offer, but the writing and acting is not always on point. A lot of times they are boring and outright abnoxious. I also don't get how Ubisoft thought it was a good idea to add characters from side quests into the main quest later on without requiring the player to complete them. (Where did Tahira come from if I didn't complete her quest????)

Leveling! We had leveling in the AC series since Unity, but this game takes that beyond. Where we had up to 10 levels in previous games we now have 55 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ levels (with the CotP DLC) with a lot of skills to earn. I like leveling systems. They make me feel like I'm actually progressing though a game and becoming stronger, but this also amounts to the farming issue.

Difficulty! You can now choose now just how tough the enemies will be, ranging from "slap me and i be dead" to "god himself may smite me and i shall still stand." That being said I played through Nightmare a few times and the only difficulty I had was with the last two bosses, which I was able to handle eventually, and the Curse of the Pharaohs DLC bosses. These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ suck. I turned down the difficulty for a couple of them cause I was at max level, max damage possible and yet dealt no damage at all while getting hitkilled.

Damage calculation! Yep, you can no longer just insta kill anyone with your hidden blade. That now takes into consideration your level, difficulty and hidden blade upgrade (which is interesting but also means you have to farm for levels which may be boring to some people.

Now, for the cherry on top of all of my cakes: the story:

I love this game's story. Why? Because I love the characters. I love Bayek, I love Aya, I love Phanos... the list continues. The characters bring me back to AC 2 and 4's level of development and depth. Seeing Bayek shedding his scales of vengeance to live by a new creed is excellent and seeing the culmination of that at the Hidden Ones DLC is just...beautiful.

Do I recommend this game to you? If you have a good PC, enjoy open world games with a few dozen hours of content to explore, good gameplay and loveable characters, then YES!

Even if you previously did not like the AC series, try this. Maybe you'll enjoy this one

if you don't no refunds from me >:)

This is the best assassin series ever! you will feel freedom in this game. This game is really beautiful, I'm serious! you will be presented with a beautiful and interesting atmosphere of ancient Egypt, like you can explore the pyramids or spyx statues even the most legendary cities like Alexandria are really formulated very beautifully in this game.

Combat in this game is okay, not too stiff and not too realistic either. This combat game is very fun for you to play. and for this game story is pretty good, there are some of the original history in this story game so you can play while learning history too.

There is 1 drawback in this game, namely the side missions in this game are very, very repetitive. you will feel bored with the side missions of this game, but the shortcomings have paid off with the vastness of this game world that you can explore when you feel bored. I recommend this game, this game is really cool to play casually. do not rush to play this game because the selling point of this game is that the game world is very beautiful and wide. You have to feel it!

Thanks to this game, I got a unique name for one of the people close to me 🐪🦎

Plus:

- Stunning and exceptionally well optimized visuals, you don't have to buy plane tickets to see pyramids. Just buy this game and you will see the whole of Egypt ( ancient, that is ). Land and sea, equally beautiful
- Fast travelling system
- Hunting for crafting to get certain items
- Minimal to none micro transactions
- NPCs are slightly better than average, as you would expect with the reactions/ dialogues
- You get to study Roman Empire and Ancient Egypt without going to school
- Very, very mediocre but heart-warming storyline
- Minimal glitches / bugs, overall decent optimization


Minus:

- Had my friend not mention about this, I wouldn't have realized it sooner. Side quests are so repetitively boring that it made me quit this game. Let me elaborate: You go to different parts of the map, face the same types of enemies, kill them, gain levels, rinse and repeat.
- 'Same types of enemies', ie same human, The only difference with these human enemies ? Levels. The only exception where you face bigger bosses are other animals , refer to: https://acorigins.fanswiki.com/Enemies. Again, the difference between the animals are levels. There are no monsters ( technically ) in this game.
- Which brings me to the levelling system, this is a arguable point, but IMO I don't prefer games where they are level dependent in order to progress. In AC Origins, you have NO ( 0% ) chance to progress other maps of the world or even the story itself without levelling up. You will get a warning by the game saying that you are lower level and not encouraged to clear the area, even if you tried to, you can't 1 shot stealth kill / can't win a combat. It's doable if enemies are 1 or 2 levels higher, but at 5 levels higher, they're just telling you to GTFO.
- Which then brings me to the grind, you're short of level, what do you do ? Oh, let's grind. At the time of writing, my game totals at around 80 hours. I was able to cap my levels by continuously travelling from 1 place to another, same kills, same combats, gain levels. It becomes too repetitive that after I had cap my levels, I did not finish the last 30% of the map and just too bored to even finish the story
- Grinding which then brings about the levelling, once you're max / higher levels, enemies are just punching bags for you, there are minimal skills needed but overall to none in the combat department. You gained levels = you hit faster/ harder to the point that you are just pressing 1 button while your character swings his schlong around automatically dealing fire / poison to whomever comes near
- Mediocre AI just like Hitman. 1 distraction and you could take them down 1 by 1. Peripheral vision by AI is poor and performing kills by lurking around the bushes is just not satisfying enough


What's fun:

- Stealth kills but NO WAY as fun like Batman franchise
- Getting OP weapons
- Different levels of transportation ( from slow to fast )


CPU/ GPU Specs:

- Intel® Core™ i9-9900 Processor
- Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER


Buy/ Not buy ?

- It is a grinding game no matter you've checked out other reviews or gameplays, etc. So if you're the kind of person who doesn't mind doing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again, this game is for you
- Would recommend to buy it during sales unless you're a fanboy of Ubisoft, then go ahead to purchase it full price, otherwise not a buy from me unless this game goes for 4$ or below

The story is good, the gameplay mechanics are decent. The biggest issue I have with this game is the REPETITIVENESS. Majority of the game plays out the same. Go here, climb this, tail this dude, don't get caught, kill this dude, escape the area. in comparison to a game like MGSV where each mission could be played out in 20 different ways. There's very little variety. In the first 12 hours of the game you have already experienced what the game has to offer then it goes on for another 20 or even more. Then there are the side missions, UBISOFT'S idea of mission variety is like this: Hey here's the exact side mission but the enemies have higher health and it's over here on the side of the map. At some point in the story the game just comes to a halt cause your character isn't a high enough level, turns out the side missions aren't just things you can ignore. In this game, you have to complete a ton of them in order to level your guy up, and I have to say, they give you very meager xp for doing a side mission that takes a while. And by the time you finally reached the required level, the story just becomes confusing at times. But, but, but, that is where time savers come in bois! UBISOFT want's you to pay for xp and equipment so you don't have to play the game you just bought for 60$.
But hey if you look over all those flaws then there is a graphically beautiful open world you can explore. 6/10 WAIT FOR SALE.

** To everyone complaining about the framerate drop and the freezing** It's a known Nvidia problem, not the game! Roll back to last Nvidia update and it works fine (Don't use 451.67! I'm using 446.14 and the game works again).

This could be the biggest Assassin Creed i have played so far, i really see what Ubisoft meant when they said they will win their fans again.

Overall:
+ Long game live
+ Nice and unique storytelling
+ A considerable amount of side missions
+ Different types of weapons and unique use of each
+ Huge map
+ So much activities
- Half of the gameplay is spent traveling in desert
- Mounts are not that fast (can't even run)

8/10

One of, if not the best Assassins Creed out there. The egyptian setup, the history behind the game and some accurate facts about human history trully puts this game amongst the top AC game collection.

I never played any of Assassins Creed games. Mostly because all of them are action games, but I don't like action games.
I bought it because it has good reviews and I like Ancient Egypt.

In the start it was fun. Cool pictures, nice cutscene, new mechanics for me. I started completing all available stuff (side quests, killing captains). At the day 2 I understood there come more of them, it disappointed me.

I finished the game in 31 hours. I skipped all unnecessary stuff after level 18, I just wanted to finish it. So, basically, it is not a feature of nice game, but I liked visuals and the end of story, so I give the game positive review.

I liked that ancient egyptian drug trip!

Pros
- So beautiful game. Deserts, cities, seas. Days and nights are different. Pyramids and tombs. Temples and shrines. Great villas and poor slum.
- Animations in combat are satisfying. Basically you just click 2 buttons but it is nice to see how Bayek kills enemies
- Animation of face of main hero in cutscene is great. I really feel that man.
- Feel of freedom is good. You can climb almost everywhere.
- A lot of locations and side stuff (quests, tombs, shrines and etc)
- End of story is satisfying

Neutral
- It is too huge. Most of locations have a lot of visual things on them but feel empty. You came in a huge city but there are just 2-3 quests. Complete them and move forward. I would like to see smaller but richer content
- It is 90% Action game and 10% RPG game. Yeah, you get exp, there is a skill tree, but it doesn't affect gameplay significantly
- There are only 3 item of equipment weapon, bow and a shield. No chest, bracers and etc. You get tons of weapons in each kill and they are all similar. It feels pointless. Also I never spend even 1 gold for entire game

Cons
- Devs tell in main screen, it is a fiction of their team. But the story is so silly. Especially the stuff with historical persons like Caesar, Cleopatra and etc. For example, Caesar attack in front line with just a sword and Egyptian fellow which he met 1 day ago. Or a scene, where some random guys get to Caesar palace with a carpet.
- Repetitive. There are a lot of stuff like enemy camp, kill captain, seek for treasure and they are ALL THE SAME. As a true RPG player I started clear all stuff and left that after 20 level, because there are a lot of similar stuff and it got boring

Resume
Very very beautiful game with different awesome views, cities, buildings, animations, effects and etc. It is just cool to see it on the screen. Gameplay gets repetitive very fast. You do same stuff. It is only 5% RPG game, so it achieves you with nothing for completion of side content. It is nice to spend 2-3 hours at evening. But it is not engaging enough to keep you playing day after a day like other RPG games. Take it with a discount just to see that graphics.

+ The story is good, but at the end I feel that is rushed.
+ Graphics looks good, but sometimes they can be ugly.
+ Level system is good and bad at the same time, I like that you need level and upgrades to kill enemies with to much level, but it's just grind of secondary missions to get that level just to beat enemies from main story because if you don't do secondary missions you will not get money, exp, resources to craft your items and you will be in main story dead.
+ You can play with 2 characters - Bayek and 
+ Some sidequests are good and the story behind them are nice too, but some are just bad.
+ Naval battles are back even if they are small, not so many like in AC Black Flag and Rogue.
+ Senu (Eagle Eye) is more important here than in any others games, with her you can see chests, enemies hidden areas, etc...
+ Day/Night circle is nice, if you want to rush camps in day or to wait for night to kill them when they are sleeping is your choice. This feels that you are an assassin and choose when you want to destroy your target.
+ Photo Mode is something new to AC and it's nice to have, you need this because they are so many things that are so beautiful and you want to make a photo of them. You can see what others players photos in the game and on the map sometimes you can see artworks from the Ubisoft that are beautiful.
+ Crafting system is simple and easy, get the materials required to craft that weapon, armor, just click to craft the item you want.
+ Skill system is easy like crafting, you can go hybrid, warrior, bow or assassin, imo go hybrid.
+ Daily missions from Reda, but they are meh, if you like to grind for items and exp you would like it.
+ Mirajes are interesting with this weird feeling when you see one and they have even side story in them if you follow them.
+ Soundtrack in any AC game is good.
+ Combat system is kinda meh and kinda good, dodging sometimes can ♥♥♥♥ you up because the character doesnt want to dodge or it's dodging in a bad direction.
+I n Colosseum and Hippodrome you can get rewards and coins with some real challenges waiting for you.

- Features from past games are not in this game.
Sitting on bench to watch/listen people and being incognito, hiring prostitues/allies to distract enemies and hiding.
- Bayek doesn't interact with , he's just listening without having something to say about the story that he's getting.
- No quest for destroying Ptolemy Statue, you just destroying them for exp, in The Witcher 3 is something similar like this, but you receive a quest for doing this, here you are doing this for nothing without any reason or something, it's just like in AC 1 with the flags, you collect them and at the end there is no reason why you collected them and here you destroy statues that don't effect the ending or after the ending.
- Bad assassinations if an enemy is eating or reading at the table, there is no animation if you kill someone, you just touch him with hidden blade, you don't put your hand at his mouth for no screaming or alert the other guards.
- Camera positions in fighting sometimes is to close to you and you can't see the enemies and sometimes is fine.
When you are fighting with a elephant, the most dangerous enemy in this game the camera is to close to you when you are running and you can't see the elephant. They really need to work on this in the next game. This elephant is just an example, but when you fight in arena or in free-roam with many enemies the camera can ♥♥♥♥ you and lose your fight.
- Sidequests that are set and don't know what you did in main story or how your character looks like. I hate sidequests that are like this because they are ruining your free-roam or pleasure to explore the world.
- Sidequests repeated with different objective that most of time are in camps. Same missions like AC 1 over and over.
The most annoying thing in sidequests is that if you raid a camp in your free-roam time and you choose a sidequest close to you that will tell you to go to that camp that you already raided you will find the camp without enemies.
- When you see a miraje your camera position goes awful, it's not smooth and sometimes you can't see that miraje because you are running with your horse and just because you are close to a mirage the camera position is moving. You can even get mirage when you are inside a room.
- Camera positions when talking to an NPC are from AC 1, I just hate them, in the next AC just make good cutscenes like in The Witcher 3, learn from CD PROJEKT RED Ubisoft, please no more camera positions.
- Pack items/gear that cost real money if you want them or grind for coins to get heka chests from Reda and gambling to get them. You can get easy gold items and purple sometimes even in a row same rarity, the problem is that you can get the same item for multiple times and this doesn't add more chances to get the rest of the items in the game. There is no sidequests to get those items like with Final Fantasy sidequest, that sidequest was more interesting than some sidequests that are in this game.
Even with or without some sidequests to get this items, they shouldn't have the option to buy them with real money, Ubisoft is just like EA.
- Parkour in this game is simple and meh sometimes, I feel that in AC: Unity the parkour was more interesting and I know that in that game sometimes the parkour was annoying, but here doesn't feel that i'm playing AC. It's just pressing alt and that's it, no good moves, if you jump from a high distance just press alt to roll to get less damage. It's a good system to climb rocks, houses, etc... but it should be more interesting.
- Glitches, bugs, crashes that are bad as in others AC games, NPC's stuck in carriages, mission objective that is in the ground and you need to restart the game, etc...
- A.I enemies are bad, if you release prisoners from camp and enemies are walking by the cages wide open they are not saying anything, like why are the cages empty with no prisoners or something like this.
Sometimes if they are 2 enemies close to each other and you kill one, the other one is like "ah he's dead, but I don't give alarm" or to panic or something, none response from him.
- Optimization sucks with Denuvo and VMProtect. Even with all the patches the game still doesn't have the best optimization.
- Draw Distance broken after patches and no option to set it how we want like in other games.

In the end I like the game and it's good sometimes even with all the issues.

There will definitely be people who did not like this part, since an RPG appeared in it and it is not the same as the previous parts of the assassins, but I recommend this game to you, excellent graphics, no sagging, no bugs, beautiful mythology, a huge open world, well, for her year Of course, I'm not talking about new games with an even more open world, the game is made great, beautiful cities, seas, rivers, mountains, characters, weapons are all very beautiful, I recommend this game to you❤️

Yeah, yeah, this review is too little, too late. Maybe I can convince someone to jump in during a sale like I did. So this is coming from someone who thought the last enjoyable Assassins Creed was the second (ship combat in black flag if I'm being honest). Otherwise I thought the series was stagnating and repetitive. This game is a breath of fresh air. Where it's not without it's flaws, it is the most fun I've had in an Assassins Creed title in years. I was hesitant to pick it up at full price, so I waited for a discount and its was worth every penny. I'm at almost 80 hours now, story complete and first DLC complete but if this is the template for how Odyssey will play, I'm on board. Very interactive open world, in a historical setting, I love it. Closest I'm going to get to time travel in my life time :P. Anyways, 9/10 if not for some combat clunkiness and awkward keyboard controls I'd give it 10, but I still think its worth a buy.

Decided to come back to this game just to relax and explore ancient Egypt, only to find out that the game no longer runs without a constant internet connection and a "Ubisoft Connect" account, which I think is just UPlay rebranded?

This feels completely unnecessary and is an objective downgrade from when I purchased the game. Did this game always require an internet connection? Why? It's a singleplayer game. It's not worth the extra effort of remembering some ancient account I never use either. Good riddance.

EDIT: I also just found out you removed the Animus Control Panel, which was half the reason I wanted to come back to the game.

You took a game I purchased and made it objectively worse. I will never purchase another Ubisoft game again.

I am fascinated with the classical world. This game allows one to visit the Pyramids, the Great Library of Alexandria, the Great Sphinx, Memphis, Alexander the Great's tomb, and so much more. This game is the best representation of Ancient Egypt you will see anywhere. The sheer scope of what the developers have achieved here is amazing. Walking the streets of Alexandria, with the music playing and people talking, is breathtaking. I got this game on sale and it was an absolute steal. I'm not one that cares too much about the storyline, but what is there is very good. I like how this game ties into the AC universe. The Discovery Tour mode is one of my favourite aspects of this game. This mode allows you to visit many ancient historical sites and explore them as they were in Cleopatra's day. Getting to go inside the Great Pyramid, seeing how mummies are made, touring the different regions of Egypt, all with a narration and photographs was by far the coolest part of this game. If you're at all interested in this historical time period, I can't recommend this game highly enough!

Assassin's Creed Origins
Definitely best Assassin's Creed in last year's. Big open world, finally interesting side quests and other activities.

Pros:
+ steam achievements ( finally! first Assassin's Creed game that have them )
+ difficulty settings ( same as above )
+ likeable and interesting main character Bayek
+ awesome big world with plenty of activities set in ancient Egypt
+ really enjoyable gameplay
+ new combat system ( its not perfect though )
+ big variety in weapons
+ looks great
+ sounds great
+ RPG elements
+ photo mode

Cons:
- can't kill chickens ( yup!)
- microtranscations ( you can buy some costumes, mounts, boost to exp/money etc. basically nothing special but its there.....)
- well some side quest could use some more work

Overall rating: 9/10

PS. Will update review later as i proceed with the game.

---{Graphics}---
The graphics are very good for this game. I played on mostly Medium 1440p downscale to 80% and the lighting is absolutely amazing. The textures are also great.
---{Gameplay}---
The gameplay is great. There are many things you can do such as hunting, fighting, and exploring. The combat and sealth is good though as an AC game there isn't much focus on sealth. Still though it is decent, and the combat is pretty nice and different. There are different types of weapons with different benefits and harder enemies show up in more difficult parts of town

---{Audio}---
The audio is pretty good. When you go in caves or some buildings it gives a nice reverb effect. The audio quality is also pretty good. What I dislike about it though is that you can't lower the dialouge volume, which is a bummer
---{Audience}---
Teens and up
---{PC Requirements}---
A fast computer is good for running this game. My rx570 usually ran around 45-55 in the streets with 80% of 1440p Medium (1152p) with textures and details at Very High
---{Difficulity}---
Easy to learn, Hard to Master. I played on hard mode and it was fairly easy until I fought enemies that were 2 or more levels ahead of me, espically the big and more advanced enemies. You can parry attacks, which can gives some buffs such as healing you depending on the shield, but you have to time it right.

---{Grind}---
What makes this game different from the majority of the older AC game is that a good amount of the game is grinding. You'll spend alot of the time doing side missions or maybe even looking for materals instead of the main mission. For me I didn't enjoy doing much of the missions, and I just wanted to do the story quests.
---{Story}---
It was fine ig. Idk it just pretty decent, not something I would remeber. Maybe if there was less grinding and more story it would be better.
---{Game Time}---
I'd say it's pretty long. Took me around 40 hours to finish the story. I did do some tomb exploring and some hunting though, as well as playing the game on hard mode (I did fail a few missions...)

---{Price}---
Honestly I'd wait till it's on sale. I personally wouldn't buy this game for 60$.
---{Bugs}---
Other than some minor visual bugs I'd say it's good

This game has great gameplay and graphics, but I don't like much of the level grinding. I give it a 7/10 (Pretty Good)

After 2 Years, an Assassin's Creed game that feels good to play.

If you were a fan, you would love this game. If you however disliked this series, this game wont probably change your disliking

+Didnt launch like Unity. Thats a big Plus. No Hard Crashes or CTD's or missing textures or abnormal frame drops
+Steam achievements for a Uplay game. Me Likey!!
+Egypt. It's beautiful and diverse
+Gorgeous Indoor & Outdoor Environments
+RPG style levelling up
+Inventory Management (not confusing/cluttered)
+Block Dodge Parry
+Focussed Combat System
+People speaking in accent. Really adds to the authenticity for me.
+Didnt realize my GPU would be capable to run the game on Ultra on 1080p. Game runs stable on 40-65FPS on Ultra with minor FPS drops here and there (which I can ignore)
+The exploration and hunting aspects are really good.
+Level up system to be able to get into some missions. At least the Side Missions aren't too much of a drag
+Music, Ambient as well as in-game
+Auto-nav system of Animals XD

-Keyboard layout. Worked about 15 mins to assign different keys to everything, now the game feels more like a game to me. Finally able to get a standard layout that isnt wonky or jarring. (thanks to everyone who suggested)
-Character models in Cutscenes look a bit plastic like
-Texture Pop-ins
-Combat Lock-on system is really a big issue. While I am locked onto others, I dont sometimes end up getting to see who is ambushing me from behind.

I was afraid to play too much but I decided to dive in, give this a chance. And I would happily accept I was wrong. The game definitely grew on me, for which I feel glad.

As of now the I havent experienced the story too far to comment on that. Will edit this later.

Always been a fan of AC this is no different. I love ancient Egypt and Romans this just makes them feel so real and i definitely would recommend if you are an AC fan or very into history and want to play again that brings that history to life.

Best Assassin's Creed for me by now. Insane world, beautiful landscapes, wildlife. This game can inspire you to study more about Egypt and Antiquity.
In one word - masterpiece. Every minute was worth playing this game. I checked every corner in the main game - it was like a holiday.

TLDR: You can play with cats and they`ll start following you, meowing like crazy. This is the reason why you should buy this game.
 
Jokes aside, Origins was developed by the same team responsible for Black Flag. Origins is so polished and its world so stunningly beautiful and well-crafted I almost can’t believe it’s a Ubisoft game. It's exactly what I would expect from other studios/developers like Rockstar, CDPR, Guerrilla Games etc., which is a remarkable achievement for Ubisoft.

Despite all the good reviews this game is getting I was really on the fence about buying it. I finally decided to when it went on sale on December and I will tell you the reason why I can’t stop playing it ever since.


ATTENTION TO DETAILS
Egypt is so alive and believable! Every single corner of the map you can see how much effort the development team has put into this game. The world is incredibly detailed and alive, there are so much small details that you’ll only notice if you’re really paying attention.

You’ll see people working, wandering, talking, singing, playing instruments. At night, the usual work fields will be empty, but if you wait there till the morning people will arrive to work, NPCs have day/night shifts and you’ll be able to follow and watch them going to sleep (creepy yeah.) The same happens to enemies, depending on how important the area they’re protecting is, you’ll see a soldier going to sleep and another one waking up to replace him.

When you’re out in the wild hunting for resources to upgrade your gear, you’ll notice how alive the animal AI is: The same species play and fight with each other, hunt and run from their predators, and they also sleep, turning into easy targets.  

I could sincerely describe other details for hours, but my point is, such an amazingly crafted world is extremely important for replayability. It’s hard to get bored of this game because of this, it feels like you’re not there alone, the AI is convincing which helps you being immersed in this world.

GAMEPLAY
This game is almost a looter. It doesn’t take it too much serious on this regard but it certainly is when compared to the previous installments. It’s also level based.

You have Ranged weapons like Bows. There is the Predator bow, which is great for head shot damage but easy to miss and slow to reload, Light Bow that are extremely fast to shot but does small damage (Jesus this one sounds so good I feel like a badass when I use it), the Warrior Bow that’s basically a shotgun and the Hunter Bow that is a middleclass of them all.  

For the Melee you have Swords, Sickle, Dual, Heavy, Spears, all of those extremely different from each other.  I personally like to use Spears for enemies with higher level than me + a Shield, making it harder for them to hit me whilst I’m attacking from afar.  For enemies with the same or lower levels than me I use the Dual (with is really fast and low damage), you can’t use the shield but you’re a lot quicker.

The point it, this game can suit a lot of different playstyles and if you’re bored with just one you can’t change you gear and the game will feel different. It’s really well balanced but you really feel like a badass while killing a higher enemy with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mattock.

There are a lot of perks that you can unlock with points from leveling up which will make you feel even more powerful, but the good thing you’ll still be challenged: It’s not so easy like the previous games.  


STORY AND SIDEQUESTS
The story so far is good. It’s not great, but good. It’s once again about revenge, but at least this time around they make you actually care about what motivates the main character to search for revenge. The reason why he is on a killing spree with his wife is believable and well written. I can’t really tell much about it since I haven’t finished it but it’s in my opinion on a par with Ezio’s trilogy.

The sidequests are amazing! They’re exceptionally well made, I dare to say that sometimes they can be compared to the quality of The Witcher 3’s sidequests! It’s not the usual boring stuff that Ubisoft throw in their games just for filler content. Some sidequests really surprised me with twists, great side-characters. Usually they’ll also reward you greatly, too. 

PERFORMANCE
It’s… acceptable. I’m running on a i7 6700k @4.6 and a GTX 970 on 1080p with a mix of High to Ultra High options. I couldn’t hit a locked 60fps regardless of the preset so I locked it to 50fps using MSI Afterburner and I rarely notice it going below 50.

CONCLUSION
This is one of the best open world games released on 2017 and it's right there with Horizon: Zero Dawn, Breath of the Wild and Nier Automata.

So much better than Syndicate / Unity.

Running a 980Ti, and i7 4770 in a triple 1080p setup (nvidia surround, 5760x1080), consistently achieving 35-45 frames on ultra.

Pros:
Mostly perfect performance (for me at least).
New combat, actually takes some skill if you want to fight someone of equal or higher level, can't always just button mash.
Phylakes are the best, can't just stamp on low level hideouts when one of them rocks up.
New item system is fantastic.
Map is massive, and amazing to look at.
Theres lots to stay for after you complete the story, side quests are interesting, and they finally got rid of boring old chests you have to lock pick and replaced them with bandit hideouts you can loot from.
Steam Achievements, I've actually been spending extra time trying to get them all.
100% sync is actually pretty reasonable (I got it in about 90 hours). I've been motivated to get full sync in Unity / Syndicate, but couldn't because there was just too much grinding (endless amounts of chests etc).

Cons:
On a triple monitor setup (5760x1080) and FOV up high, water doesn't render on the far right and left of the screens.
Can't run the game off a hard drive formatted as a Microsoft Storage Space, had to create a symlink since I didn't have enough space on my none MSS drive.
In deep water I lag a LOT, the ocean is mostly fine, but water in tombs really lags me out, almost unplayable.
Fire looks terrible. Minecraft legit has better fire graphics.
No ability to replay missions or certain events. Other than arena fights or chariot races theres nothing you can replay without creating a whole new save.
No stat / sync tracker, considering this is the first AC game I've been motivated to 100% it would be nice to track progress towards this goal (and see it at 100% once done!!)
No database like previous AC games.

This review is only temporary until I finnish the game, but so far this game seems really good. The year off was definitely worth it and this game is far better than the last few AC games, maybe even better than AC4.
Also the performance seems pretty good to getting an average of 35-45 fps at very ultra settings on a gtx 960
Hopefully the game stays this good throughout

Pros
- Arbitrary access to the real world story arc and a fleshed out Animus user that provides a narrative hook for the player.
- The bleeding effect is back. Useless, but still there. It was probably missing in AC:Unity because they couldn't work it in.
- The original artifacts and no sages or blood drops or lightning swords or teleportation camel saddles (ok I made the last one up, but why not after the AC:Unity sword)
- Eagle sense is a LITERAL EAGLE circling above you, how cool and fresh is that?
- No camelcr*p eagle sense gimmicks like "smell-sense" from AC:Unity
- Completely figurative assassination cut-scenes and farcryesque, hallucinogenic dream sequences that feel more like a visual poem / eagle-sense-fever-dream than an FX-happy intern's post processing assignment.
- Heatstrokes
- "OMG is the Sphinx really that small?"
- Everything from the AC logo to the finger cutting practice get an origin story, which is a nice touch. Also the point of the title of the game. Obviously.
- Animus glitches are Egyptian Gods' personifications.
- No "income system with a lazy backstory because Ezio was a landlord" (I'm still looking at you Unity)
- Brutus

It's as if... It's as if Ubisoft was listening to the reviews. AC:Origins fixes everything I hated with a passion in AC:Unity.
BUT

Cons
- New game plus is a joke (you can practically jump right to the second play-through by turning the auto-level enemies on and playing at hard difficulty.)

- UI is confused about its relationship with Layla. Is it her Animus interface or is it the actual game's interface? Animus hacking and new game plus do not belong to the same narrative level. OR IS LAYLA'S STORY ANOTHER LAYER OF A SIMULATION? (cue in the Inception Bwah)

- Really, really on the nose dialogue along the lines of "we are assassins and our creed will live on... *wink wink*". Only thing missing in certain scenes is Bayek staring right into the camera like Jim Halpert from the Office, along with a snap zoom.

- I guess it was designed to be this fateful saga in the AC universe that sets everything in motion, but I think it was too spread-out in general and too on the nose when it was emphasized.

Well I'm knitpicking.

Story-wise it's still not anywhere near the Desmond story arc, but it's a way more dignified continuation than churning out new things like the sages or whatever the f*ck that stupid sword was in AC:U out of thin air to replace the currently expired elements. It doesn't frustrate like AC:U because AC:O is either taking elements from the previous games by making it obvious (like the artifacts), or trying something new like the Eagle-eagle-sense.

It's self contained. The characters are appealing. It's a specific, personal and fresh little story. Starts violently and ends with a powerful historic scene.

Fair enough Ubisoft, you won me back.

Don't write Assassin's Creed Origins off just with the 'AC Formula' conceptions

Well well, it seems that the game has taken lots of people by surprise. There are so many different and new things in AC Origins that makes it wholly different from the previous iterations.

The game took many ideas from various games like The Witcher 3, Horizon, and even Dark Souls, while still keep the Assassin's Creed identity intact. The game is still mainly revolving around stealth and assassination, but there are also some notable new/improved things such as:
The combat has been revamped so it's now fully action with dodge and lock-on system
There are various weapons with its own moveset, utilities, as well as pros and cons
Weapons and armors have special effects/conditions (bleed, poison, resistance, etc) like what's usually found in RPGs
The map is not just a single city, it's a whole country with lots of villages, towns, and huge cities
The map is also divided into leveled-zones just like in RPGs. You can go to high-level zones but will definitely get wrecked in an instant
Other than the main quests, gameplay loop revolves around exploration for side quests and points of interest
Exploration is well-rewarded as you can get exp, loots, lore, and even MC's characterizations and hidden dungeons/encounters
Side quests are well-written and not just a simple fetch/kill quests, some of them are even chained to the following quest
The stealth is more challenging due to the improved AI, but still satisfying. Scouting the area with the hawk is pretty useful as well
The day/night cycle is not only for show now. NPCs have their routines so you can have an easier attempt at assassination at night
Synchronization doesn't reveal everything on the map, it only shows side quests and the optional points of interest
There are no collectible junks as far as I'm aware, everything is useful whether for crafting materials or making money
I'm liking the direction of the franchise has taken. It made me went from zero interest on the franchise to full anticipation for their next game. Though I'm considerably new to the franchise (only played AC II and Black Flag for a bit) so some things that are listed above might not be a new addition to Origins.

Overall, this seems to be the best game in the Assassin’s Creed series. That extra year of development time has really helped Ubisoft find its creative center again, and craft something that feels both fresh and energized. The game feels fresh, has a new combat system, RPG elements, a great story and looks absolutely stunning. With so much to explore and do in its jaw-dropping setting, Origins is exceptional. All I care about is how utterly engrossed I am with the gameplay loop.

About the Main Game

Beware that Ubisoft changed the development of the series after the weaker titles AC -Unity and AC - Syndicate. This game still has to do with Abstergo, the Animus and assassinating people. However, it shouldn't be looked at as an Assassin's Creed title in comparison to the first three games. The story about Desmond and others couldn't go on forever. So Ubisoft tried something new.

Story
The main story doesn't offer you anything completely new to the series. First of all, the protagonist gets introduced and the story builds up some tension.
Although it starts pretty promising, the storytelling returns to old patterns that have proven to work for Ubsisoft in previous games of the series: Assassinate this or that guy. Oh no, there are others. Assassinate them as well! Still, there are some epic battles though I have to say: the ending of the main questline felt pretty abrupt to me.
Side quests aren't anything special most of the time. Neither the charakters, nor their problems are interesting. Only a few contained memorable stories.

In conclusion, nothing special, but not too bad either.

6/10


Gameplay
The gameplay hasn't been fundamentally changed, really. However, there are a few different types of weapons and bows that allow different playstyles. The three-way-skill-tree allows to invest in further specialties. Controls felt pretty solid, I never jumped any directions I didn't want to go.
The developers did nothing wrong here sticking to patterns that have proven themselves many times.

7/10


Visuals
The highlight of the main game is the open world design. Although the tasks in the non-story-related locations are pretty repetitive, just riding or walking through the world is an amazing experience.
There's so much detail put into most locations, you gotta love it.

9/10


Soundtrack
The soundtrack is memorable but gets very repetitive and boring after a while. Main reason being: There aren't more than about five different tracks. Investing more in the music could have really underlined the beauty of the open world.

2/10


About The Hidden Ones (DLC)
The first and smaller DLC around the Sinai. It takes about five hours to complete all quests.
Storywise, it's a bit stronger than the main game. Sidequests and their charakters were a lot more memorable and interesting. After all, the climax of the main questline felt pretty abrupt to me. The open world remains good-looking. A little bit of new soundtrack here and there.
Get this if you want a little bit more of main game.

6/10


About The Curse Of The Pharaohs (DLC)
The second and bigger DLC. It's not huge, but it offers another major area to the player.
I don't want to spoil anything of the story here, but I can say that the main story and sidequests were a lot stronger than in the main game. Mainly, I guess, because it isn't alike anything you've seen in the AC Series before. You'll find yourself sitting there wondering what the hell is going on a few times (in a good way, trust me). The quality of the open world remains the same, soundtrack is a bit better than in the main game.

8/10


Conclusion
If you like open world games, riding around, Egypt and pyramids, I highly recommend the experience, but you shouldn't be expecting a strong story-game.
Nonetheless, I would recommend buying the DLCs on sale.

Secret information: Don't change the spoken language to anything else but English. Just don't.

Best Assassins Creed game to date.

I kinda left the franchise when it became pirates and stuff, but I really liked 1-2 and Brotherhood.
Recently I'm doing a marathon of AC games from 3 to Valhalla and boy I can tell you this one is the best of the series (haven't played Oddyssey or Valhalla yet).
Ezio's story comes close second, but this is the stuff.

Definatelly check it out if it's on sale.

"Oh look, another AC game"

But its not like any other AC game, this one went to the next level. Though i never expected Ubisoft would make a really good RPG, this one has to be the most immersive game yet from the franchise. Well done Ubisoft.

The map is huge, filled with different locations, different quests, historical characters.
Also the graphics is really good, especially the environment. With the help of Photo mode, you can take decent photos as you explore egypt. Just look how beautiful Egypt is in this game.

A must-buy game for screenshot lovers like me.

+Decent story following the Origins of the brotherhood.
-Some quests can be repetitive

With having excellent graphics, performance, on the other hand, though you met the system requirements still it wont run well, as i have 40-50 fps with settings mostly on medium. This game is quite not optimized :/

This game is worth the price (though i suggest buying it on a sale).

Truly one of the amazing Assassins Creed experience i had for a while, im giving this game a 9/10. Would leap of faith again

The largest, most detailed, authentic and alive rendition of ancient Egypt ever done.

This is a game that deserves to be played if only for that. The detail, fidelity and scale of the world is truly stunning. You will be fully inmersed in the setting, being able to walk remote deserts, roman streets, egypcian temples and even explore the interior of the pyramids. Or climb them!
You'll also be able to see where the team got every detail from the excellent Discovery Tour, which is leagues better than the old databases and sadly has been discontinued in the saga.

Now, the game itself. This is a very poor Assassin's Creed game. The parkour has been stripped to just press X to climb everything. The movement is floaty and way too fast. The combat is even worse than previous entries, exchanging the Batman - Arkham games style combat for a more generic action rpg one. The equipment system is extremely barebones, featuring random loot composed of too few items with just a random handful of effects. The stealth kinda still works, and cleaning up forts is fun, but gone are double assassinations, gadgets or hiding into crowds or in the scenery.
This is a generic open world rpg clone with a pinch of stealth, and has been stripped of all its identity.

Narratively, the game starts strong, with an interesting protagonist and a cool setup, but passed the halfway point, the story gets rushed, with characters and situations coming and going without much build up or explanation, skipping over extremely important details and effects without solid causes. It is conceptually good, but executed extremely poorly.

Overall, this game is a very mediocre affair, but I fully recommend playing it just because of the incredible game world. It really makes up for everything else and is among the greatest game worlds ever created.

I really can't understand how people rate a game that has more than 50 hours gameplay a negative review with just 30min in game or as soon as they see a bug!!!
Come on guys!

Ok, as people like to know about the game, I'm listing some of my opinion after about 5hrs gameplay:

+ Start of the game and story is strong
+ Bayek, His act and voice is superb
+ Egypt, it's recreation and graphics are awesome and with it runs perfect on my 3770k, 980, 16gb ram so well
+ Music and ambient sounds are perfect
+ The redesigned fighting system fits so well and I like it (It's more personal maybe)
+ So many other gameplay options like: changing the time and people behavior about the time, their routine life, one key for parkor system and it's fluid animations, ...


- Lack of sprint for horse, camel
- No option for how much time you want to pass
- AI and enemy behavior could be much better!

It's actually a pretty good game. It looks great. All the modern day and assassin's crap to minimum which is great. Fun setting.

But that quadruple DRM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ has to go. It keeps CPU at constant 100% load, crashes steam, locks up inputs and just ruins experience of otherwise good game. I cannot recommend this game as long as it has 4(!!!!!) DRMs on it. That is just mental!

When Ubi will remove Denuvo and Vmprotect from this game, it'll get a proper review, until then there's no point really. It's just not functioning on the most basic level.

Giagantic screw up. Just like AC2.
AVOID UNTIL PATCHED!!!

I have to say this is the best Assassin's Creed game ever made.
I am a huge fan of the series and I would have to say black flag was my all time favorite and i didn't think any other Assassin's Creed games would beat it but oh my god was i wrong.
Every moment of this game was fun and entertaining, from doing the main story quest to just running around hunting or stopping a convoy or tomb raiding or one of the MANY side missions. There is just so much to do in this game and i never found myself bored or not wanting to play. Absolutley loved it, Ubisoft got it right with this one. 10/10

Great game set up in Ancient Egypt with a lot of content.
If you have never played Assassin's Creed game series, this is one of the two best entries to start from, the other being Assassin's Creed 2. It introduces new for the series gameplay style (a simplistic RPG), a new chapter in the modern-day story, and it's just a good game.
I have played every game in the series, and this one is one of my favorites. The only caveat is you might need to upgrade your PC; that aside, the game is definitely worth the money and time spent.

Pros:
- Probably the best thing about this game is the main character - medjay Bayek. Unlike most other protagonists of the series, this guy can really be called a hero: he always tries to do right, is driven by noble motives, faithful to his wife and religion, but at the same time not blind. Sounds too good? Yeah, but at the same time he feels real. This was made possible mostly by terrific voiceacting of Abubakar Salim (honestly, I don't remember any other game character with such range of emotions). The story is a typical vengeance tale, but Bayek makes the journey very real and filled with sense.
- Huge open world spanning the whole map of Ancient Egypt (and not only). Pyramids, Sphinx, Pharos Lighthouse - all of that you can see and touch. The world is full of people doing all kinds of daily routines, which makes it very lively and you can really feel immersed into the history.
- Great music by Sarah Schachner, a combination of Egyptian motives with modern electronic styles.
- Gameplay is a nice refreshment after the low point of AC:Syndicate. For the first time in the series, enemies can attack you together and not just stand there and wait for their turn. In practice, this means that the combat is hit-and-roll style, but the arsenal of tools and a couple of special moves makes it pretty engaging. Even after 100 hours played, I would sometimes discover a new way to fight.
- For the first time in the series (AFAIR), you can set the game difficulty. I played the entire game on the highest possible difficulty, and many encounters were quite challenging. If you just want to know the story, you can always switch to easy.
- For the game of this size, there is surprisingly small amount of bugs. There are more bugs in DLCs than in the main game, but nothing game-breaking.
- As with most Ubisoft games, there is pretty much nothing missable, so you can just enjoy your journey through history without worries.
- We got a first staple modern-day protagonist since Desmond and some modern-day gameplay. Not the best one, but definitely better than what was happening since AC3.

Cons;
- The game is pretty heavy on resources, and not with the best optimization. Denuvo DRM makes it even worse, and Ubisoft is not going to remove it. Oh, and you need to have Uplay ot play this too. So, in your background will be Steam, Uplay and Denuvo - that in the addition to an already demanding game. When people play a cracked version of the game just because it runs better, you know something went wrong...
- At some point at the game, you will inevitably feel overwhelmed with the number of locations. There are just too many question marks on the map! There is a good variety of different activities and assets though, so this point in the game will most likely not come very soon for you.
- People around you talk a lot. The problem with this is that the assortment of their lines is very limited, and they start to annoy pretty soon. The most annoying for me was "Ha! Pessesh en gerrehh" (commonly known as "High precision, Garret!"), which means something like "It's midnight" in the game's version of Ancient Egyptian. Needless to say, you can hear it any time of the day...
- After playing the game, I got the impression that the Roman Empire was the ultimate evil and so are most Romans. Now, I am not a historian, but I am pretty sure that it is not so. Also, the history in the game is a bit disconnected from the story. If you just play the game, you might get lost in the current political situation and such. There is a discovery mode which is a kind of virtual museum, but it is basically a completely separate game. And you probably shouldn't play it before the main game either, as it will show all the major locations and will take away the joy of discovering them yourself. So I ended up reading some wiki articles on ancient history (which is not a bad thing, but I wish there was more explanation in the main game).
- (common for the series) You will kill hundreds (thousands?) of possibly innocent guards and soldiers to get the treasure they are guarding. No way to fix that though, except not playing Assassin's Creed at all.
- As the game is very big and made by many different people, there are some inconsistencies. For example, there are quests where you kill people just because they hunt animals. On the other hand, by that time you would probably have hunted hundreds of animals yourself. Not fair!

P.S. Many people complain about microtransactions. I didn't find it annoying at all. You can play throughout the whole game without even noticing the store button, it's pretty worthless. In single-player games like this, you wouldn't want to get the best weapons upfront, as it will just make it less interesting (and the store doesn't even have the best weapons). Just ignore any real-money stuff and enjoy the game:)

Better than expected

Ok so I was going to wait until I finished the game for a reveiw but this game is so freaking long. Unfortunately I have a job so I'm not able to play it as much as I would like but in any case I have a played a good amount and feel I can give an honest view point. So let's begin.

GRAPHICS

Holy mother of crap this game is utterly gorgeous! It rivals The Witcher 3 even, except not in performance, which we'll get to. But honestly as far as the graphics go it is fantastic to explore and I have spent a lot of time just looking at it. The detail is insane and it feels pretty authentic scale wise. I love ancient history and this is one of my favorite time periods so seeing it brought to life so beautifully is a real a treat. Tombs are cool, lush areas, big open deserts, lively cities, and a fantastic looking sky box. Another thing is the water. If the The Withcer 3 is considered (jokingly) the candle light simulator than AC Origins is Water simulator 2017. Never seen better water graphics/physics in my life. Over all really good looking and great fun to explore.

PERFORMANCE

Ok so here is the unfortunate problem everyone is dealing with. Performance is pretty bad. I have played 68 hours so far and I haven't had a single crash, so I guess that is something but hitting a stable 60 fps is impossible. I have an i7 3770K processor, GTX 980 ti, 16 GB of RAM, and running on Windows 7 with a 1080p tv and it struggles even though I am above recommended specs. The only way I have hit 60 fps is way out in the desert where there is barely anything to process. Cutscenes are really choppy and stuttering is getting annoying. I have found a decent work around though. After patch 1.03 I decided to cap my frame rate at 45 fps. Now it runs perfectly and this allows me to put the graphics on max settings while still being able to get something smoother than 30 fps. Also my CPU nor my GPU will ever hit 100% usage this way no matter where I'm at so it is a good compramise I suppose. I truly believe all the stupid DRM is the issue so hopefully that will be removed but until then this is a solid work around and is playable.

GAMEPLAY

Ok next is game play. Gameplay is not too bad. Climbing is smooth and accurate. Shooting your bow feels pretty good and animations aren't bad. My one big hangup is the combat. I don't hate it but I don't really care for it either. It's really good for an RPG but bad as an Assassin's Creed game. I miss the old styalized combat. They sacrifice epic style for challenge and strategy. There just aren't very many finishing moves and you only get to do a finishing move on the very last guy in a group and it only works half the time anyway. So you could take on 20 guys but only witness one epic looking kill. I also feel this game could benefit from a counter button. Focusing on one guy at a time is frustrating when archers and others try to sneak up on you. Don't even get me started on the guys who constantly throw smoke bombs at you. If you could counter them for just a second and then go back to the one guy you were focusing on that would be great but no such option is given. Also the hidden blade is very disappointing. You can't fight with it and it is used for stealth only and there is only one animation kill that is used over and over again every time you use it so stealth can get boring and repetative. "But it's more challenging this way and blah blah blah" I don't really care for challenge (I hate Dark Souls) so I was a little worried when I saw the combat but was relieved when I saw a difficulty setting. That's fine if you want a challenge I just wish they could have made it more styalized. Overall though I usually avoid RPGs because combat is always dull, tedious, and boring but in this case the combat is just good enough to keep my interest and keep me going. I just feel a lot of improvements could be made. Also the microtransactions are bull$h!t and are way too expensive.

STORY

Story is good so far, I'm about 75% done or so. Side quests are actually decent and have cutscenes and everything. They give a little more to the main story as a whole much like The Witcher 3. That game definitely had influence on this one. Bayek is also an awesome character. No one will ever top Ezio but Bayek is a close second and is much better than previous titles. (no one can be worse than conner, lol) Over all story seems good and you get to meet a lot of ancient historical figures and it makes the setting that much better.

OVERALL

Overall this is a decent game that is fun enough and interesting enough to see it through to the end, and it is a long one. Great setting, awesome graphics, good characters, decent enough combat and overall a fun time

SCORE

8/10

The greatest comeback story ever told

Before I start the review, it is safe to say that a lot of people in the gaming community do not like Assassin's Creed. A good chunk of people think of it as repetitive, unoriginal, and uninspiring series in their past few titles. Not to mention, some of their games have been extremely glitchy/buggy.

The thing that Ubisoft centers around in Assassin's Creed is this one element:

If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Their games were this:
Get mission
Assassinate
Very strict Stealth mission
Reach vantage point
Weird mission
Plot twist that is average
Rinse and Repeat

For some people, this was never a problem and it felt perfectly fine to have this type of gameplay. It oddly scratches the ADD or OCD tendencies that we have and makes you feel like you are going through a meditative experience. As humans, we like to fall in routine so what better way to get in the groove of things with 'fun' repetition.

Hence the "Oh my god, I just played this game for 8 hours in one sitting?" feeling.

Stardew Valley is very guilty of this and who would have known making a farm and seeing crops grow would be satisfying?

If I was Ubisoft and I was making millions off this formula, no freaking wonder I would barely change it and rehash it every year!

This time, they went balls to the wall with getting their games to be more than just tedious.

Back to the drawing board

Assassin's Creed was in hot water because their last few titles were quite simply not selling enough. Unity was glitchy, Syndicate was great but not strong in the sales department, Rogue was also good but just more of Black Flag in every respect.

The last memorable Assassin's Creed is without a doubt Black Flag. Ubisoft needed to get this game back on it's good graces and let everyone know that their cash cow is not going to die out into the sunset. First thing's first, some time off and think:

"How can we make this game stand out from the other games?"

Assassin's Creed follows a more Action RPG approach this time around. For example, instead of a barebones Combat system, it is a meaty and visceral experience; something that could compare to a toned down For Honor combat system that only includes Light Attacks, Heavy Attacks and Dodging with an Overdrive Meter that fills up everytime you land a strike. Each weapon archetype has different functions when it comes to the Overdrive meter. Giving the player the option to test out each category and see what is the one that they favor the most

An example like this shows that Ubisoft understood that they had to do drastic measures to make some noise. This was a great risk on their part. To get away with stealth and go action oriented and boy did it work.

"Out with the old, in with the new."

In my playtime of the game, here is what is better:
Climbing/Freerunning
Combat
Godlike World Details
Looting system w/ Item Levels
Your magical bird that scopes out the area
Stealth and Sneaking (that magical crouch button)
Cutscenes
Story
Minor complaints for me are:
Bugs where the enemies get stuck in walls, floors, along with other NPC's and Mounts.
Story is good but if you dont pay attention, you will get lost. Certain games have a beautiful magnetism in their storytelling that it is almost impossible to not pay attention (Killer is Dead, Uncharted 4, Last of Us, etc.)
Some mechanical mishaps such as your horse derping around terrain and enemies having the innate ability to know where you are when invading.
In game Micro Transactions. I plead guilty. I gave in and bought a set that makes my character look like a pharaoh.

A game that keeps on giving

When you play this game, you will find it hard to compare it to the previous entries in the series. There are so many different aspects and very few same ones that you will actually compare it to other games that it gets influenced by.

This is easily Metal Gear Solid V meets Witcher 3 meets Assassin's Creed. The immense map and activities to do are all fun and barely tedious because of the fantastic progression you feel when leveling up and geting better loot across all of Egypt. Bravo, Ubisoft!

Even though this game has a Fast Travel option, I spend a lot of time cruising around with my horse on the sand dunes from Point A to Point B. That is how much detail there is in the world, that is how much they changed this game, that is how serious they are when it came to being mindful of others playing this.

I look forward everytime to fighting because they no longer want you to stick to sneaking as the viable option. You can get alarmed and duke it out with every poor soul in any camp you take over. It is immensely satisfying when doing so too. Seriously, I do not think you understand how gorgeous this game looks. Even on Medium-High settings it is a serious looker.

Give this game a shot on sale or full price if you are a Assassins Creed fan that is dying to play it.

Assassin's Creed Origins ★★★★★ (4.8)

LONG REVIEW by jSM 2019

tl:dr One of the best AC Games ever! Great 100% factor to it, feels amazing to play, stealth mechanics are almost perfectionated, when ignoring the sometimes wacky AI - can not recommend this game more!

I had a blast, that lasted 200 hours and gave me many happy memories while playing this masterpiece of a game over the course of almost 3 years.

This is by far the best Assassins Creed game out there and for me even AC II and Brotherhood can't compete with this game. Bayek is such a great and sympathic character, the world is beautiful and interesting, there is enough side content to make every little cave and spot valuable to the largest open world of all Assassins Creed games (except maybe Odyssey).

If you are a fan of either the AC franchise or of RPG games in generel and even slightly like what you will read through, grab this game at a sale, play it and make your own opinion on what i consider to be one of the best games out there.

That said, Origins is not only one of my favorite 100% games but also one of my overall favorite games of all time, even with all it's flaws that it might have.

The Good...

Assassin's Creed Origins is what many expected when it first came out: a new try on the slowly repetitive AC franchise. Giving the player a whole new understanding of the series, integrating RPG elements, a huge Open world in ancient egypt, horses, camels, many interesting characters, an outdated, stereotypical but still relatable main plot, a TON of interesting but also fairly simple and fetch-quest kind of side content and quests & with Bayek of Siwa, a medjai (former protectors of the pharao and the folk) one of THE, if not THE best Assassins Creed main characters of all time (sorry Ezio)

The open world is a massive construct, devided in level orientated areas that you'll discover while progressing the main story. From Alexandria, to the big pyramids of Gizeh, to the Fayyum and through endless deserts, this is the most beautiful and authentic open world AC has ever seen and it catched me the first time i ever set foot in it and still does when remembering how the Assassins Creed Origins title appeared after finishing the almost 5h long prologue! - Every of the about 35 different areas offer the player a variety of ? that represent points of interests. From hidden treasures, papyrus-riddles that need to get solved using the given hints, outposts of the local militia or bandits in the open, AC typical lookout towers that allow your eagle "Senu" to spot enemies and quest objects from a further distance, using the eagle vision, animal shelters/camps, where you have to kill a special "alpha animal" that drops you more than the usual ingredients that you need to upgrade Bayek's gear, such as your hidden blade, armor or arrow holster.
-
Overall there is A LOT TO DO, whether your searching for the next phylakes (strong bounty hunters that will be set out in the world (in there respective region) after a certain story point and will hunt you down), fighting war elephants aka. the strongest enemies in the game in their arenas, progressing through the main story, or collecting one of the many crafting materials such as iron, wood, etc, Origins has a lot to offer for any kind of player, while giving you access to RPG typical experience points to aquire all kinds of skills like allowing you to control your arrow mid-air, extra damage, better attacks with one of the multiple swords, spears, staffs, battleaxes & many other skills.

All of the playable weapons have their own playstyle, spears are long and slow, while dealing more damage, battleaxes even more so, while the dual blades deal less damage but are quicker to use and feel more "assassin"-like. Every weapontype has their own moveset, chargeable attack and power attack once you have build you power attack bar up. Normal swords come with a stab and shield bash, heavy axes come with a rage mode, that allows you to deal more damage while having higher armor stats, dual blades let you jump your enemy and with the upgraded skill even stab your enemy multiple times while you sit on top of them and so on.. Overall a nice design concept, the same goes for the bows that all come with their own playstyle.

The world also looks absolutely stunning. Rarely have i seen a world that sucked me in so well, giving me this kind of immersion, while having this kind of graphical finesse. From an artistical viewpoint every landscape seems to be made just to be looked at for hours and hours upon. I could say much more but instead just look at two of the many pictures i took with the ingame camera mode to tell for yourself.

I dont want to say too much about the story, because this is something everyone should experience for themselfs, but even though it is a "stereotypical" story, i did enjoy the majority of it.. You meet all kinds of historical characters throughout the game, the cutscenes are beautifuly made, designed and animated, aswell as acted. The english, as well as the german voices are all believable and feel true to what they try to tell you, although the english voices are (like in most cases) still a bit better than its counterparts.

The Boss fights are overall well designed and are fun to experience even on the hardest difficulty called "nightmare" - at first this is a experience for very grounded players but after a while playing on nightmare almost feels like second nature and when playing with a stealth/bow build the overall difficulty is so easy that playing on either hard or higher becomes almost a necessity. - Only with the DLC and high end game bosses the difficulty isn't perfectly balanced and ends in pointless hack & slash, without tacticts. You die in one to two blows while your enemy tanks hundreds if not more. This is not good game and enemy design, just lazy and pushed me to turning down the difficulty to the easiest mode after fighting some of the DLC / War elephant enemies for 20 minutes, dealing almost no damage on the highest level and the best available gear.

All of the achievements are a challenge to play this game even more, are nice to finally aquire and (imo) are a perfect example on how to create good achievemnts, grinding them never once felt like a waste of time, was a reason to clear out all the question marks (having slight OCD when it comes to open world maps also helps with it) and all in all Origin is probably one of my favorite games to 100% ever made, even though having to play the DLC's just to finish the game on steam with 100% was a punch in the face at first. Having played both DLC's on 100% now, it feels a lot better and i do not regret having spend all the time and money.

The Bad...

Not much actually, the enemy design regarding boss battles and their insane amount of tank abilities are a slight concern, but the feature to turn down the difficulty at any time solves the issue.

Here and there are some bugs and glitches, the framerate can drop in populated areas and the climbing mechanics can be as clunky as you would expect them to be from an AC game but nitpicking this as a big problem would be ridiculous.

There are lootboxes in the game but they can only (or almost only) be received and opened through the ingame currency. When opening you can receive either purple or golden rarety items that are all capped at your current level (can be leveled up later on for currency) and are all nice to look at and to play with. But since they are practically lootboxes, the received items are pulled at random, so in over 200h of playtime i still havent gotten the dual blades that i always looked for (rip me)

Tl'dr version:

Perhaps the best Assassin's Creed yet. Ubi's 1 year hiatus of the series did it no end of good. The RPG elements turn what would have been a drab action adventure game into a lengthy romp through Egypt. Obviously, hugely influenced by the Witcher 3 in almost every respect.
Additionally, possibly the best interpretation of the ancient world in any game ever made. As an avid classicist, HUGE PROPS to Ubisoft Montreal.

WARNING, CONTAINS MICROTRANSACTIONS

You can follow me, and see the rest of my work here:
http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides

Elaborated version:

Ok, first off I'd like to preface that this game has quite a lot of microtransactions - make of that what you will.
Some of you might wonder why I'm giving this game a pass when I ripped into Shadow of War. The answer is I'm not. If I was able, I would be giving this a neutral review purely on the fact it has microtransactions however, in this case they are not as invasive as the ones in SoW where they were literally built into the subsystems of the game in a thoroughly insidious manner.
Make no mistake, they are still bad here, but I can't bring myself to give this a negative review purely on that fact.

Attitudinally, I would also say that this has been my first AC since BlackFlag, since I haven't even bothered playing the rest. That does not mean however, that I have not been keep tabs of Ubi's meddling and taken into account all their little invasive tactics; Unity's buggy microtransaction riddled strore springs to mind.

Onto the core-game, and it's a doozy. You're Bayek, a magi (some kind of Pharonic body guard essentially), and you're out on a quest for vengeance on those who killed your son (Not really spoilers, its on the back of the box). You'll be bouncing across a absolutely insane map that dwarfs almost every other I've seen in a long time, it's absolutely bloody massive; stretching from Siwa, to Alexandria, and through Memphis. That brings me to my favorite part of the game, the settings.

Not gonna lie, I got the game just for the chance to bounce around Hellenic Egypt, and boy do they do it justice. Every little detail of the ancient world has been captured immaculately, from the fresco's on individual buildings, to the slowly crumbling limestone coating on the great pyramids themselves. It's absolutely insane. With that said, you'll need an equally insane rig to experience it at it's fullest, as anything less than 5 year old hardware will be chugging hard, especially in the more densely populated areas.

Luckily, the options menu is fantastic. You'll have every opportunity to tweak every setting to get it running how you want it. I would highly recommend turning on the dynamic resolution option, so you can keep stable frame-rates without sacrificing fidelity. On it's highest settings, the game looks nothing less than fantastic to the extent I have almost no criticisms.

I have heard however, that some users have been experiencing some severe framerate drops due to the nature of the DRM. I kind neither confirm nor deny this as I myself have had no issues.


Microtransactions.

It's an online store, plain and simple. It's avoidable however, not like SoW. I strongly urge everybody to stay away from the virtual currency. Some of the stuff you can buy from the store is designed to break the difficulty gradient to make things so easy, you'd might as well be on Easy. It's a trap!!

Story.

Pretty run of the mill Asssassin's Creed type drama, but suffice to say their are lots of twists and turns, and tons of political intrigue to get your teeth into. Some may not appreciate the heavy emphasis on politics this time around, but for me It absolutely made it better.

Movement and Combat.

Think normal formulae of Assassin's Creed, but mixed with some of the Witcher 3, and a splash of Dark Souls. A strange mix to be sure, but it seems to work to work quite well. Bayek retains all of the agility of his Assassin compatriots from the other games, but you'll find he's a little less OP. Gone are the days when you could mow down a whole battalion of soliders without breaking a sweat. Instead, the combat mechanics focus a lot more on strategy, with a Dark-Souls esche combo system, where every blow counts, especially at the earlier levels. You'll eventually build up your tech tree where you are just as insanely OP as the last games, but you'll still have to think a little harder than before.

Additionally, the RPG mechanics are extend the number of weapons. Now there are multitudes of different weapon types ranging from spears to Khopesh's (the Dothraki curved swords), to warhammers, as well as many types of bows. Each one of these items will have been stated according to its level. Thankfully, you can only use weapons lower or the same as your own character levels, which keeps things balanced.


Sound.
Truly amazing. Swords sound viciously sharp as they whistle through the air, along with the hustle and bustle of ancient life. Some of the more intellectual among you might also notice there is many different languages being spoken across Egypt, ranging from Ancient Greek, to Latin, and some others I didn't recognize. Both are true to life and absurdly close to how they would have spoken in those days. Again, major props to the devs for the accuracy of the setting!


Conclusion
Again, not concentrating on the poor industry behavior, this is a truly phenomenal game. If you have an eye for scenery or like taking screenshots, you'll spend more time gaving at the insane monumental scenery than actually playing the game. There is something to like in almost every aspect of the game, and so I recommend this to almost everyone.

Review based on difficulty to 100% achievements

8/10 - Takes a while to fully complete game to get all achievements, no grinding required and no outright stupidly hard achievements to get.

Assassin's Creed® Origins (Souls Creed Origins 3 : The Wild Hunt)

- Much better fight- and new level system (similar to The Witcher and Dark Souls)
- Many factions: Egyptians, Greeks, Romans
- Beautiful graphics (even on low-quality settings)
- Awesome setting (Old Egypt)
- Fantastic story

I have to say that this game has surpassed all my expectation.. a huge open world with countless quest & places to explore and not to mention that the beauty in this game is undoubtedly one of the best you can find. I also like the ancient Egypt environment which make this game unique.

But the only problem this game has is that you cannot assassinate enemies if they are 2-3 level above you and that is something that makes it feel off for an "Assassin's Creed" game. We should be able to assassinate people regardless of the difference in level because that is what an Assassin's Creed game should be like.. like it used to be.. Assassination game. Right now it has more of an RPG feeling.

The last game i liked as much as this was Assassin's Creed Unity which in my opinion had perfect gameplay mechanics & environment regardless of what people say about it's story.. but gameplay wise Assassin's Creed Unity was a perfect Assassin's Creed game one could ask for.. and there should be more AC game like that.

I'll Rate it 9/10 just bcoz we can't assassinate people who're 2-3 levels above us.. other than that a perfect game to play. Highly recommended.

I'm currently 67 hours into this game when I'm making this review. Assassin's Creed Origins, The newest in one the series. A massive open world to explore the depth of Egypt and its ancient history. If you are a history nerd and a fan of the Assassin's Creed series. then I think you will enjoy this game pretty well, anyway here is my pros and cons of the game.

Pros:
+ Big open world with alot of sidequests and places to explore
+ Photo mode
+ Amazing Graphics
+ Steam Achievements
+ Good Main story with alot of known charachters like Ceasar, Brutus, Pompey and Cleopatra
+ Intresting story from the main character(Bayek)
+ Alots of Weapons to chose from (Chose your own fighting style)
+ New fighting Combat system (Can ♥♥♥♥ you really up tho, so not a perfect system but its a start)
+ Skill tree is cool (Guided arrows is OP as ♥♥♥♥)
+ Can pet cats
+ Can tame a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lion and go around and kill everyone!

Cons:
- Fps problems
- Microtranscations (can buy costumes, mounts is okay. but Buying boosts, exp and money?) thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up.
- To much grinding (if u dont want to use money to buy idk leather to upgrade your armour then u need to grind alot, more and more when u upgrade more)
- Miss the parkour from Unity tho
- Xray vision is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
- Lock on system in the combat system is really weird and not good at all

Conclusion, Even tho this game has it's bad things, it makes up for it for all the good things it has, thats why I will recommend this game!

AC Origins is finally moving the game series to a level, that got me into a "rage gaming". Although there were always elements of sci-fi in the form of the "Isu" race in the assassins, and the details associated with it were revealed more and more in each part.. until Origins was able to give historical events a bigger and correct dose of fantasy that I personally prefer.

Events of the Egyptian Empire from the time I will put in simple tags - Cleopatra | Caesar | Chaos on the throne | Roman occupation | Civil War | The demise of the pharaohs.
The events are more or less adhering to real historical facts, they are only adapted to the style of the Animus world, as in fact in each part. This wonderful treatment of the Egyptian theme will surely please many gamers and history lovers.

Despite the huge selection of different types of armor, weapons and riding animals, I played my entire campaign in the style of the first civilization of Isu (armor, both bows, mace, daggers, shield and extreme epic horse), personally the idea of ​​the first civilization is very interesting for me and more games from the series I will be hoping for another piece of information regarding Isu. However, I have to describe the choice of styles a bit, such as mummies with red eyes, poisonous weapons, undead or hellish (Egyptian hell - Duat) horses and camels, various styles of Egyptian special forces such as scarab soldier, armor of pharaohs, or Roman or Spanish troops, and those different kinds of weapons.. normal, special, fiery, poisonous, even lightning and divine.. or time sword.. for me the real "ceiling of epic" was the style of the god of the underworld Anubis, fiery armor, sword of Duat, bow of souls, poisoned shield - really incredible possibilities.
To meet 100% of everything that Egypt has to offer, you need to count on a longer playing time, some achievements are a challenge.
Origins offers a lot, but for me the best DLC curse of the pharaohs was where the smaller fantasy part of the game turns into the majority part and I was surprised by events of epic proportions.. exploring the afterlife worlds Aaru, Aton, Maat and Duat is an experience.. but I'm not going list spoilers here.

Origins put the overall impression on me surprisingly high and at the moment I remain in anticipation of the same quality in Odyssey and Ragnarok. 90%

Review in progress:

1. Looting. There's no "hold E" to loot for most of the items. You do have to hold it for the larger items, but that's not a big deal since it's faster than before and it's not all the time. +1 for me.
2. Game is beautiful. Draw distance is superb and adds to the realism. Characters are highly detailed.
3. Performance is really good (Very High settings at 1440p on a 1070 laptop 45-70 fps depending on the area. Desktop is 70-90 fps at very high 1440p 1080ti). There's also a lot of PC specific settings, benchmarking, and in the options menu it'll tell you how the game ran for the past 30 seconds by giving you a graph with fps and frametime for CPU and GPU.
4. In terms of gear, you can obviously gain loot from high ranking captains and such, but you if you find a certain sword or bow that you like, you can go to a blacksmith and upgrade your weapon and it'll scale to your level.
5. No Chromatic abberation, film grain, vignetting, or motion blur. +4 for me.
6.I like that you have a mount.
7. You have a more control over your parkour. In previous games I got annoyed at times because my character would run up a wrong wall or do something that I didn't want them to do. So far, this version seems to be more fluid. While I'm talking about parkour, it doesn't play as significant of a role as previous games. Which is fine by me. It's fun, but it did become monotonous in the other titles.
8. Combat system does take some getting used to
9. There is auto-movement (like using the jeep in FC4), which is nice so you can enjoy the scenery. You can create custom markers to auto travel to; you're not limited to objectives.
10. Side missions are much, much better than before. Granted I haven't played them all and they may end up becoming repetitive, but they feel a lot like the Witcher 3's side quests. Now, they're no where near as good as the Witcher (I mean, the Baron's side quests were some of the best I've ever played), but for Ubisoft to take some time and flesh them out, add variety, fully voice act a lot of them shows they're trying to make a change. In the previous AC games, I rarely did the side missions. They felt so boring, repetitive, and completely forgetable.
11. The world feels alive. Black Flag and Unity were excellent in creating the world that felt alive and bustling. Syndicate felt dead. I think they took another cue from Witcher here.
12. I like the main character a lot. I think the voice actor did a great job. But a lot of times the mocap seems off with his lips...Not ME:A bad, just not as good as it could be.

It feels like they took a few of the better ideas from other successful games while maintaining the AC identity. Glad I bought it. I was skeptical at first because Ubisoft has a way of making games look and play better than they actually are, but I think this one is a good and much needed change for the series. There are a lot of things in the open world that are useless and are simply clutter, but I think the new changes make the game a much better entry to the series than the stagnant yearly release it was in before. I'll be updating the review once I'm finished with the game to discuss story/characters.

The best thing of this game is the environment. Environmental artist really did a great job. The monuments, the desert, the cities, all look great and the views are outstanding.
The Story is nothing out of this world, in fact, it leaves so much unclear. I mean, I know about the eagle vision, but this game just gave me a Warg in ancient Egypt. i'm not complaining, it's just weird in terms of the lore of previous games, where the eagle vision was more of an intuition-sixth sense kind of thing.
The combat is not bad, but it's very repetitive. The upgrades don't really add much dept into the combat, and even if you don't get them, you are not missing much. I believe previous games had more of a stealth-focused combat, and this one went full melee. Well, the Arenas are clearly a proof of that.
What I really didn't like was the Nightmare difficulty... Boss NPCs 10 levels lower than you could still 1-hit KO Bayek. And the DLC Pharaons were more of a joke, where the skill was not an option, and all you had to do was spam the same lame attacks.
Also, the whole Abstergo-Animus arc was really useless. I don't even know why they added it, it doesn't bring anything to the game... Small easter-eggs and something about the live-action movie.
In general, it was a good game, but not as epic as the Ezio trilogy, of course. So far I've played AC1, AC2 trilogy, AC3 and Black Flag, and I'll leave it at the bottom because the story wasn't as good as the others.

For me this game was the best game from Ancient Egypt era. I really loved how open-worlded this game is. Many places to explore, interesting quests to do, phylakitai hunting etc.. This game also has thing callwed "Discovery Tours". I though it will be boring, but it's really awesome. You can learn many interesting things from them (and even from the main game). It actually helped me with studying :P

Origins is absolutely stunning and worth your time even if you're not a fan of the Assassin's Creed Series.

While Origins here on PC is CPU heavy (I've seen upwards of 92% CPU utilization while in Alexandria or Siwa) it runs incredibly smooth if you've got the Rig to handle it. Personally, I have a 1080TI and this card eats Origins for breakfast. Everything is set to Ultra and 60fps is silky smooth with zero stutter.

My best advice?? Play Origins with a Trainer so you eliminate the needless Grind. As amazing as the whole experience is, Level Gating is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it'll hamper your overall experience: Origins fares much batter without the whole "Welp, I can't go here because I'm 5 Levels short!!" mentality. Trust me.

Definitely pick this one up. It's an absolute STEAL especially when it's on sale!!

If I didn't have such a mega history boner for ancient egypt this game would suck total apocalyptic ass. But my god. Tombs. the sphynx. The pyramids. The lush gardens of Alexandria. I can deal with boring combat map clearing games if I GET TO TOUCH THE FACE OF THE GODS.

If you're a person interested in culture, theology and the history of Ancient Egypt, I cannot recommend this game to you enough. 550 hours later, this game still promises hours and hours of fun, intriguing combat and heartwarming interactions with NPCs, all while you're surrounded by absolutely astonishing graphics. I learned many tactics and found many secrets during my playtime and I keep finding more and more things every week. If you by chance are fond of details, subtle storytelling, atmosphere, aesthetics and interaction with other people in games, this is by far the best personal example of an excellently-made game.
There's something for everyone: unique items for collectors, historically accurate arts & crafts for history fans, interesting gameplay and action for adrenaline junkies, an intriguing story for readers and watchers, and beautiful scenery for artists. The details and world building in this game are both phenomenal, the graphics are breathtaking and the controls are fun and easy to master. If you are looking for a challenge, this game is not for you, but if you are in any way an artistic person and prefer getting immersed in the beautiful ancient world of royalists, merchants and farmers, this game will not disappoint you. There are many paths you can take in this game, despite the story, of course, being linear, but the best part of this game is the freedom it gives you. With intriguing and unique content and stories, each step you take is different, but take my word and please, take your time while playing this game. Do not rush through it, do not skip dialogue, do not run wherever and whenever you can. For gods' sake, that's what Z is for. Get on your mount and walk through the town or go for a stroll through the village. Help out your fellow farmer after they'd dropped a haystack, make a dog happy and pet some cats. Light up some candles, sit down on a bench with your neighbour and enjoy the sunset, or warm up in front of a fire during chilly nights. If you are madly in love with the green waters of the Nile, lush gardens of Athu and the bronze sands of the Desheret, trust me, you will feel like home.
Just don't forget to take some screenshots, camera mode is astounding, especially in 4k.

Assassin's Creed Origins is an interesting point in the series, this is where Assassins Creed was infamously known as the repetitive yearly franchise, bringing a product that barely evolved with each release. Origins is the response to criticisms, they've added in a lot of mechanics from other games here and while I do think some changes have made massive improvements to this formula, there are a lot of poorly implemented ideas that result in Origins becoming a bit of a mess. I still enjoyed my time with Origins, but there were just a few too many pitfalls for me that I can't really recommend it.

By far my favourite thing about the Assassin's Creed franchise is the historical settings each game allows you to explore, and Origins is no exception in delivering an exciting world. Egypt is so unlike anything we've seen in the franchise so far, there's a surprising amount of variety through the map. Most areas feel relatively distinct from one another, you've got the isolated small towns that fit into the desert perfectly, and sharply contrast the more populated cities. I think the difference between the desert and plant filled areas also made for a surprising amount of map variety I wasn't expecting, same with the isolated areas of Egypt lacking in enemies and free for calm traversal, accompanied by some solid music. Unfortunately, the map did feel very empty to me at the same time. Enemy forts & camps were plentiful but they all felt extremely similar, and the few tombs I explored never felt exciting to uncover, especially when there's no incentive to other than money and loot in a game that's already teeming with it. I was especially disappointing that roughly a quarter of the map was gated at max level, incentivising you to stay away when in reality, these parts of the map contain almost no content (which I felt was a really misleading way of portraying how much content was in the game until you've already finished the story). While not the best at serving gameplay, the recreation of Egypt was fascinating to explore and took up the majority of my game time that wasn't directly in service of the story.

The story is unfortunately pretty stock standard for Assassin's Creed. You've got the standard kill a bunch of people throughout the country plot, but I don't think I've ever felt this unmotivated to do so. Origins relies on one extremely weak plot hook throughout the entire campaign, and it just does not deliver. The main campaign is full of uninteresting characters, conflicts that failed to engage me, and a story line that just goes on for way too long that I was completely uninterested by the end. I also cannot believe how little this game has to do with the titular "Origins" of the Creed, its briefly discussed in the last moments of the game, but overall has no focus in the narrative. The one saving grace is Bayek, who is a pretty solid protagonist to play as. He's got this calming mature tone to his actions, but is not afraid to showcase extreme emotions, and overall made for an enjoyable character to experience. However he rarely gets to show this, due to a lack of agency in the main story and far too little interesting side quests that actually involve Bayek as a character. And these side quests really are just run of the mill, I found a few good ones in my play through, but an overwhelming amount are just "kill bandits" or "steal thing from place full of bandits" that they just made the game feel extremely bloated. Origins failed to hook me with it's story, and Bayek really needed more time to shine in this game.

Origins introduced quite a rework to Assassin's Creeds' gameplay systems and it's pretty evident from the get go. Combat has received a significant overhaul for the better, and its actually engaging for I think the first time in the series. Weapons feel different from one another, you have a couple options for attack and defence & it actually requires some level of strategy compared to the standard parry-fest of previous entries. It's still rather basic however and a lack of upgrades that make much impact leave the combat wearing out its welcome fast, but I appreciate the steps taken here to make a huge chunk of the game more enjoyable. Stealth more or less operates the same, but removing a reliance on gadgets in favour of sneaking around enemy bases made for a more exciting gameplay loop for me (although using the bow could make things a bit easy at times). The reworks here definitely work to Origins' favour, but I don't think they quite did enough to give Origins much of an identity, it doesn't excel in any areas, just grabbing the basics from a lot of other games that execute these ideas much better.

The biggest change is the introduction of RPG elements and I think mostly they're fine. I don't care for massive amounts of loot, and I think most of the skill tree was bland, but neither felt detrimental to the experience. But special mention needs to be brought to how much levelling ruins this game. Origins has such a strong reliance on levelling to get through the game, but levelling up never changes combat. Both Bayek and enemies feel the exact same for the entire game aside from a couple upgrades, so I don't think areas needed to be so gated by high level enemies. The worst part is any enemy 3 levels above Bayek will become near invincible and deal a point o ungodly damage, to the point where even assassinations, the franchises staple 1 hit kill, will do maybe 1/10th of their health bar. I think this was an atrocious decision, it limits the player so much in where they want to explore, forced to grind up in order to merely survive. Combine this with the huge jumps in required levels for story content and the disgusting drip feed of xp, and Origins becomes dreadfully inflated, forced to do an awful amount of mandated side content that just drags the game out. I don't understand this decision, the side content should be there for those who want it, making it mandatory just highlights how repetitive the core gameplay is, and drags down the experience as a whole. Origins has no reason to be as long as it is and the poor inclusion of RPG elements just brings more attention to the worst parts of the game.

4/10

I couldn't quite mesh with Origins, although I respect the steps its taken to revitalise Assassins Creed, it created even more problems and needs so much more cleaning up to bring the game to an enjoyable standard. There was still a fun game in here, but it was just dragged down too much for me by its many problems. I'd recommend it to existing fans of Assassins' Creed or anyone who wants to chill out with a simplistic game in a beautiful setting; I spent most of my time in Origins talking with friends at the same time, and it was a good background game to get lost in. But I just don't think it does enough by itself to be a worthwhile experience.

A complete new set up from the same franchise. I am glad they have finally made an AC game that is worth investing time into. It has been long time since last time I enjoyed an AC game (i.e. after the Ezio storyline). Played over 100 hours and this game is worth replaying. Amazing storyline, amazing sound tracks, amazing graphics (finally a good optimized game for PC). Gonna recommend 100% to everyone.

So this is my second review for Assassin's Creed Origins. My first one was a lot more negative than what this one is going to be. I feel that my opinions on some areas of the game have changed quite a bit. Because of that, I felt the need to make a new review.

The Story

Assassin's Creed Origins (ACO), is set in Ancient Egypt during the Ptolemic Era. You play as Bayek, a medjay and protector of Egypt. Bayek's story is tragic. He and his wife Aya seek revenge for the death of their son caused by a group of people called The Order of Ancients. The story sees you enacting their revenge as you travel across Egypt assassinating each member of the group.

Whilst this is happening, Egypt is in turmoil with a weak ruler and a suffering population. Egypt is inhabited by various peoples, each with varying political opinions and luxuries that cause conflicts all across the country. Most of these conflicts are caused by The Order of Ancients, so although what you are doing is personal, your actions are helping the people of Egypt.

So how good is the narrative? In short, it's alright. I enjoyed it more this time around. The characters are decent enough and the quality of the writing is great. Where the narrative fails is in its pacing and significance. The narrative structure for most of the game consists of finding somebody and killing them. To do that, you have to travel and investigate to find out who the target is and where they are.

For the most part, these missions are really good. However, the story begins to rush itself in the later hours of the game. Avoiding spoiler territory, Bayek and Aya are developing an idea that pretty much forms the basis of the entire franchise, but the story doesn't give this idea much showcase. Instead, you are thrown back into doing the same loop of activities you were doing before. It gets too easy at this point. This is present in side quests as well. There are many side quests that are simply too short. They end abruptly and leave you wandering what exactly the point of all of it was.

Despite these problems though, I enjoyed the story. It's memorable and has dozens of iconic moments. Bayek and Aya are great characters and although they could've had more character development, they carried the narrative for me. The way the writers were also able to tie in real historic events into the story in an immersive way is also worth some extra points.

The Gameplay

If you've played previous entries in the franchise, this game will feel very different to you. Pretty much every area of the gameplay has been improved. They completely transformed all of the previous gameplay mechanics into a much more smoother and open experience. This new style of gameplay allows the player to freely approach different scenarios in the way that they want to.

The best way to talk about the gameplay is to split it into three different sections; combat, stealth and exploration. Each of these sections blend together to create the base of ACO. To clarify, this game is not an RPG. It does contain RPG elements, but these do not constitute a role playing game.

The combat is the most in-depth part of the gameplay. It is designed to be a hitbox system allowing room for maneuverability and creativity. The game has a lock-on system that allows you to target specific enemies, though it doesn't force you to use this. You can turn it off with the press of a button.

There are a wide range of weapons you can use ranging from swords, spears, bows and battle axes. Each weapon type is distinct from the other, and overtime you will develop preferences on what to use. As well as these weapons, the player can obtain skill points. These points are mainly earned via levelling up. They can then be invested into areas that broaden the possibilities in combat.

The game has a really smooth and fluid combat system that makes every combat encounter engaging. You are encouraged to play the way you want. Whether you are sniping enemies with a bow from a distance, charging them head on, or sneaking up to them and killing them with your hidden blade, there is a play style that will fit you.

The stealth in this game isn't mandatory, however, it is foolish to ignore it. There are many moments in the game where charging in and killing everyone you see isn't an option. You can be powerful, but you can easily be overwhelmed when soldiers call for reinforcements.

To help with this, a new feature to the franchise was added to ACO. You have an eagle called Senu. With the press of a button, the player takes the perspective of Senu. Senu essentially acts as a drone. You use him to mark targets and plan your way through a tough situation. It creates a layer of strategic depth that adds to the "being an assassin" niche.

Lastly, there is exploration. The eagle plays a big role in exploration. As well as being able to mark enemies, he can also mark treasures and other points of interest. The map is filled with distinct locations that have their own objectives. Completing these locations gives the player XP, which is vital for progressing through the story and obtaining new skills.

Another benefit of exploring is obtaining resources. Using resources, you are able to upgrade various parts of your character. These upgrades are entirely option, but they do have an impact in how well you play.

Each section of the gameplay has something that connects it to the other sections. It's because of this connectivity that the gameplay works so well. It all blends together brilliantly, to the point where I don't really have any complaints.

The Visuals

One of my favourite parts of this game was exploring the ancient world of Egypt. The game world is vast, varied, and beautiful to explore. The game covers the whole of Egypt which is an impressive task to achieve. Each section of the map is distinct from the other. The designers were also able to include various historical sights such as the Great Pyramids and the Library of Alexandria!

There is a high attention to detail in every location on the map. There are times where I got lost wondering through vast canyons or exploring the various tombs. I would've enjoyed exploring even more if the optimisation was better than it is. This isn't the worst optimising I've seen but the rapid FPS drops when exploring cities or towns is annoying. My PC is more than capable to run this game, I shouldn't be having issues.

The design of other things such as characters, weapons and clothing is also really good. It all looks authentic to the time period. The animations for the characters could've been better in some scenes but for the most part they are fine. What bothers me the most is the boring cinematography. This is present in the normal interactions that Bayek has with NPCs. Having the player being able to move the camera around as two characters talk to each other whilst looking like robots isn't interesting in the slightest, and it detracts from the experience.

However, despite these issues, the game is still gorgeous to look at. The level designers and the modellers deserve massive praise for this. Their work is phenomenal. Assassin's Creed is known for having interesting and well designed maps. This one is no exception.

My Final Thoughts

I'm glad I gave this game another go. I can't explain why my thoughts changed after playing it a second time. Perhaps it's because I was more patient and took my time with things. All in all, this is a great game. It's not perfect, but it's beautiful to look at and amazing to play. Definitely a step up in the franchise.

Pros:
-Gorgeous world
-Smooth combat system
-Decent story
-Attention to detail

Cons:
-Inconsistent narrative
-Boring cinematography
-Poor optimisation

Final Rating:
8.5/10

Edit no2:Since everyone is focussed on EA they are missing out the ♥♥♥♥ other companies are up to.Today we talk about Ubisoft.Of course they were going to monetise this.And they included a nearly universaly despised system of monetisation i.e Microtransactions.This game also has 3 editions one of you can get you the season pass.But apparently Ubisoft thinks 90 dollars isnt enough money to have all content from a singleplayer game.Because they added more stuff to the store(items from which you cant actually obtain items at the moment even from heka chests) and that will set you back about 30-35$.If you wondering i beleive that is actually more than the price of the season pass itself.Plus one of these "Packs" has the best in game weapon.This game is great There is absolutely no doubt about it.So if you buy this,Do us a favour dont buy the ♥♥♥♥ from the e-store no matter how tempting it is.Because if you give hem an inch,they take a mile.In the next AC we will be starting out in boxers and all outfit will be a dollar each.You decide which fate you want.

Edit:I have finished the game 100%(Well except the hippodrome races but they suck).Took me just more than 100 hours to finish.But the game still continues to surprise me with things i havent seen before.
The trial of the gods Boss battles are a little dissapointing thoughYou just shoot arrows through the glowy thing in their chests when the option is available.

A Huge Identity Crisis on its own,But a masterpeice in the grand scheme of things.

Origins will make you feel weird.Really really weird.Like AC just awkwardly smashed into the shores of RPG-land and is trying to call it home.

But Undeniably this is a fun game.And WAAAAAY better than the repetetive boredom that was Syndicate.

I have finaly finished this after playing for more than 40 hours.If you just rush through the main quests you might complete it early but in my opinion this game deserves a lot more of your time than that.Having the quests system in this game just makes the game flow a lot better and sometimes you may not even realise that it has been hours since you have touched a main quest.

I have to Say they have done a spot on job with the story as a whole.It gives the player plenty of opurtunity to do whatever it is they want but also makes sure the story isnt forgotten.Also There is a playable modern day protagonist now(Thank ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ god) but i you dont like that story arc dont worry,YOu can spend all your time in the animus.For people like me who do care about the modern day storyline this isnt a return to form but it is a return from death.Also the main story of the game itself juggles the mystical elements quite well with the reality.It seems Origins has taken the best things from every game before it and maintained perfect balance so that the people who like the storyline can have their story and the people who dont like the AC narrative can just play along stabbing people in Ancient Egypt.This is beyond a shred of doubt the Best Assassin's Creed game.

Though none of the Side quests thus far really stick with you(Like the bloody baron quest from W3) they are really well Done.In a sense Origins finished what Unity started with its Paris Stories and Murder mystries.You can lose yourself in them but not for too long as after a while you can see the limitations in the mission design and it becomes repetetive(Like every open world game ever)

Moving on to the next best thing:Modern Day is back.And dont worry if you hate it you dont need to indulge into it much.Those dont even last 5 mins unless you want them too.You are free to roam around outside the animus too if you want ALA Brotherhood's monterigionni(I completely butchered that).

The Main charcter Bayek(For the most part) is probably my favorite among the assassin's.(Haytham is still the best character).Bayek is a calm and composed cahracter who you can tell has earned wisdom through his experiences in life.BUt he can also be fun.He can also get drunk and start fighting.But one thing i have got to say is that this guy has some severe anger management issues.I felt like spamming the "That escalated quickly" meme again and again

The stealth is.............Somehow good and bad at the same time.I am definitely missing social stealth and thus ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ up a lot,but the system is more solid than previous entries.the cover system is gone and i have no idea why and that too is a confusing choice.

As for the crafting and leveling up dont worry progression isnt slow.The whole drama about mt's and lootboxes was basically useless cuz you dont need any of that.Bosses drop Rare and legendary weapons frequently.Plus you get a garunteed legendary if you complete the daily quest.Also one hit assassination arent really affected because thus far i have been able to assassinate enemies 3-4 levels higher than me.Just keep upgrading your hidden blade and you should be good.

Now for the port.I would like to point out that thus far i havent faced a SINGLE BUG.Lucky me.MY audio glitched one time but was fixed 2 seconds later.I am running the game on a GTX960m 4gb,i7 6700HQ with 8gb ram.Its on par with the min specs and so far i am impressed by what it can pull.I am running 900p all medium(except textures those are High-As high as possible) and getting about 40.SO all is good for me.

However a lot of my freinds are facing problems.One thing that fixed a few of these issues was enabling Tripple buffering.

However if you have a CPU that is 4 cores or less dont expect 60fps.No matter how good your GPU is.Double DRM surely plays a hand but it is nearly not as bad as a few people are making it out to be.But their presence is felt and is not welcome.This is a cpu heavy game.Apart from that there is absolutely no problems whatsoever with the performance

Overall Origins puts the series into an identity crisis as it desperately tries to fit in a genre it isnt meant for.But even after the games struggle with its genre the game is a masterpeice for sure and is right beside BOTW and Zero Dawn this year.

If i were to rate it i would give it a 9/10 deducting the 1 because of it cant make up its mind on what it wants to become.

Definitely recomended though,It is One of the best games this year.

Was playing Odyssey, love Odyssey!!
Lunar new year sale 75% off Origins, cheap as hell lol.

Comparing to Odyssey - " It's the same, but different "

-I feel this game is more about stealth where as Odyssey is more about combat.
-Also has an overwhelming amount of content and exploration, massive map.
-Love the atmosphere, tons of little noticeable details-ex: the fire it is impressive, in Odyssey is downgraded, is most noticeable when using the torch.
-Also feel this game has more passion and heart put into it, as it was the developers first game.
-Is more realistic and combat can be tricky at times, Odyssey has a much more refined combat system.
-Has the same super low sound voice bug in cut-scenes as Odyssey, developers just carried there bullsh*t over to Odyssey, shame on you - subtitles are a beautiful thing sometimes hahah!!

Will crush this game till there's nothing left as well.

New Update:
-Cut-scene voice bug is fixed now
-New content and rewards

Please listen to this review, I AM TRYING TO SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY. Do not listen to the youtubers. Don't listen to Ubicentral or Fizhy. Do NOT BUY THIS GAME, at least for now. I was told about how this game is beautifully optimized and how i should "for the love of god, buy assassin's creed origins now". However noone ever told me about the anal rapage on my cpu thanks to DRM. I have a 980 ti, a 5820k, and 8gb of ddr4 ram, and i get absolutey slaughtered by inconsitent framerates, even on high settings. i cant play in Alexandria on very high or ultra settings. This game's DRM just started ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on my cpu. This was supposed to be my truimphant return to the series after not buying syndicate. Just when i made my way back i got destroyed. Please wait until ubisoft fixes this. Do not buy this game. I will update my review if it ever impoves.

I believe the time I spent on this game is plenty of proof explaining why I recommend this game. For years I delayed playing AC Origins, having doubts over this franchise morphing into an open-world RPG. How wrong I was. This game is worth all your money, even at full price.

Above all else, the world, the landscapes, the ancient cities and settlements are magnificent and the main selling point of this game, at least for me. This is not top-notch graphics quality mind you, but the level of detail, the level of knowledge regarding Ptolemaic Egypt is simply stunning.

In about 130-135 hours I completed most of the stuff this game has to offer. The main story line, the side quests, the DLC's with all of their content, the papyrus scrolls, the myths of the pharaohs, all the landmarks and all of the game achievements. Probably what's left are some discovery tours and those bloody chariot races. At the end of the day, I am completely satisfied with the direction Ubisoft took with this franchise. An open-world RPG of Ancient Egypt is every history geek's wet dream.

My only minor complaint is that they did not provide some more naval battles. The ones that were part of the story quest were good, but too brief. Ptolemaic Egypt was a major naval power, even during its decline period so it is a pity that I could not get more naval battles and incursions. From what I heard though, AC Odyssey provides plenty of these, so I am looking forward to that!

As someone that didn't really like any AC games but Black Flag, I have to admit: this one is trully amazing.

The map, every detail, the 'new' combat system. Everything about the 'new' game seems just amazing.

Really worth the money.

Bought the Season Pass that Ubisoft advertised with the text:
"THE SEASON PASS WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS TO ALL MAJOR EXPANSIONS AND EQUIPMENT SETS"
So far 2 equipment sets have been released that was not included in the Season Pass, so we have to pay for it.
Ubisoft is completely ignoring their promise about what the Season Pass includes! This is FRAUD!

This game is a 6 out of 10. It is neither great nor terrible. The Ubisoft open world design is something that isn't really for me. It is almost like doing the dishes or cleaning the house. It feels like a task, a list that you need to check off. The fast travel system is supposed to save you time but because you need to climb a statue/tower/grain silo/etc to unlock them and most cities only have 2 of them so you still need to traverse a lot of ground just to get anywhere since the cities while beautiful to look at and walk through are quite big with many empty spaces. Most quests are fetch quests. Some quests are even fetch quests within a fetch quest. This becomes quite tedious and takes the joy out of it for me.

I would only recommend it if you enjoy the Ubisoft open world formula. Because if you don't enjoy that part, you wont really miss out on anything.

Nothing much to say except; this was magnificent. AC wasn't always my favourite game series, I've only ever finished Black Flag and Rogue, but this one grabbed me right from the beginning and gripped me right til the end. I put an insane amount of time into this game, into getting 100% completion (those final two achievements will forever bug me though) and it was a hell of an experience.

Jaw-droppingly gorgeous, fantastic VA, engrossing story, fabulous combat system, and an enormous world to explore and discover.

This was fantastic and if it truly had any downsides it would be the shocking sys-abuse it had. CPU usage was off the charts, for no good reason, and had near constant stutter/hitching during cutscenes, as well as frequent performance drops in towns. That's a shame, and even though I was eventually able to eke out a fairly constant 60fps (town traversal notwithstanding with the terrible framepacing and the frequent drops to 40s and 50s) on my 4.3Ghz 3770K, 16GB RAM, and a GTX1070 OC'd to 2Ghz, it should still be improved significantly IMO. I can imagine people on lesser systems being seriously frustrated and having to cap framerate to 30 just to get a decent experience.

I wholehearted recommend the game to anyone who loves AC, anyone who loves great stories, and anyone who gets a kick out of huge open worlds.

Marking not only the 10th main installment, Assassin's Creed Origins was released just in time to stamp the 10 year anniversary of the much beloved franchise. For a decade now, players have entered the Animus in search of legendary treasure and ancient artifacts; exploring the sprawling city of Rome, sailing the seas of the Caribbean, witnessing the construction of colonial America, fighting in the French Revolution, and so much more in the shoes of classic, fan favorite assassins such as Altaïr, Ezio, and Edward. Origins has promised to deliver fans the story of how the Assassin Order began, and what better place to weave such a tale than that of ancient Egypt.

The primary story revolves around Bayek of Siwa, the last known Medjay of Egypt, during the Ptolemaic era and the final years of the empire; to put it in laymans terms, 49 B.C.E, and during the time of Cleopatra's rise to Pharaoh over her brother. Without going too in depth, as the story is exceedingly well crafted and should not be spoiled for anyone, Bayek's story is one of personal revenge, and beside him stands his wife, Aya. The vengeance quest sends Bayek to hunt down thirteen members of what is only known as The Order, while both parties help to serve Cleopatra, ensuring her rise to power while the malevolent force of Rome, ruled at the time by the tyrant Julias Ceaser, loom overhead. Though the description may sound a bit bland, trust me when I say that this synopsis is leaving out every single the juicy detail. However, the modern day story arc leaves much to be desired, and it may disappoint long-term fans to know that it does not pick up where Syndicate left off.

The land of ancient Egypt is absolutely awe-inspiring in every way imaginable. While thoughts of the land conjure images of neverending deserts and sand dunes, not even a recognizable fraction of Origin's land is made up of these fictitious imaginings. The map is extremely diverse, and it's filled with beautiful, busy cities, refreshing oases, and startling clashes of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman culture. Above all, the glorious landmarks and jaw-dropping statues are what really make the exploration in this title fun and interesting. Gamers can expect to visit the Great Sphinx, complete with nose and paint, as well as the three Pyramids of Giza which don their original smooth casings. Statues of old Pharaohs and gods stand towering over city streets and inside temples, while the cities and temples themselves are adorned with lavish carvings. Ubisoft really went all out with the intimate details in this game, and it's all incredibly commendable.

With a staggering 34 map sections to explore, over 120 main missions and side quests to complete, 58 synchronization points, and dozens upon dozens of locations with challenges to complete, one would be hard pressed to say that there's nothing to do in Assassin's Creed Origins. From exploring ancient tombs, to looting chests, killing certain enemies and animals, and even discovering secrets hidden by Minerva herself, there is easily over 60 hours of gameplay present for those who want to get their money's worth. Otherwise, the main story can be completed in about 12-15 hours, but the additional content should definitely not be missed. The side quests feel far from generic, and each of them feature dynamic characters that Bayek becomes aquainted with; some of the missions even turn into larger, more in-depth tasks. Origins is truly the first Assassin's Creed title that lacks an abundance of repetitious behavior, and all time constraints have been eliminated, which allows players to roam freely and take their time with any given mission.

Much like Unity and Syndicate, Origins does have a detailed RPG factor to it, complete with a multi-branching skill tree, weapons and shields with stats, many different mounts, and various outfits, all with three rarity qualities; legendary, rare, and common. This time around the outfits do not offer anything further than an aesthetic appeal, and neither do mounts, and there are an incredible amount of both to collect; Ubisoft even have additional ones that players can purchase with the infamous Helix credits, aka in-game currency bought with real-life cash. However, it's worth noting that the best weapons and shields in the game are not bought with microtransactions, so there's no pay wall standing in the way of Bayek being his best. Sadly, a lot of the skills are dismissable, especially the over-hyped animal taming that Ubisoft pushed at E3; in most cases, it's not even worth the effort.

Among the advancements, the entire control scheme has changed. There are no more convoluted parkour buttons, but rather one for ascending and one for descending; there's no longer even a run button, as Bayek moves at full speed at all times unless he's crouching. Being stealthy is a lot easier, even for clumsy fools like myself who can't hide in pitch dark. Ubisoft must've also taken a page from The Witcher 3, since there's now a "follow road" option for when Bayek is on his mount. It's a great option if one needs to get up and stretch, grab a drink, let the dog out, take a poo, whatever it may be, however there are times that this option can lead players straight into danger, and coming back to a random desynchronization is both irritating and disappointing. Eagle Vision also now has a new meaning, as Bayek uses his pet Senu to do all of the scouting and targeting.

With that all said, Assassin's Creed Origins runs on the AnvilNext 2.0 engine, which is also used by Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands, Steep, and both Assassin's Creed Unity and Syndicate. Many folks have compared Origins to Wildlands in terms of how it plays, and those people are not far off. Senu, the Eagle, does control with great similarity to the drone in Wildlands, and the overall control scheme and functionality of Origins feels extremely similar. It's also sad to say that both titles have abhorrent optimization, and a plethora of technical problems. On my i7-6700k/GTX 1080 rig, I saw frame rates as low as 45 and as high as 120, with a standard rate of 65-75; mind you, all settings were maxed and I was using 1080p resolution. The biggest clincher is why Origins devours a whopping 70-80% CPU usage while running, however. Twice the game hard-locked on me, as my CPU usage skyrocketed to 95% out of nowhere, and one time it was while I was attempting to shut the game down. A smaller downside to Origins is the lack of soundtrack and the bad quality of of the sound in general. While everyone's voice acting is top tier, especially Bayek's spot-on emotions, the quality of everything from voices to footsteps sounds compressed, especially when using a high quality 7.1 surround sound headset.

Disregarding its downfalls, Assassin's Creed Origins is the best installment in the franchise to date; in fact, it borders on Game of the Year quality. The map is easily 4-5 times bigger than any other entry, and it will take dozens of hours to polish off all of the side quests and location exploring. For once, it's worth paying the huge launch price of $80 CAD, as the hours played to price ratio comes in at about $1.25 per hour for a full completion run. Even the deulxe edition content is worth the extra $10, as the weapons given are the most powerful that gamers will encounter until the very end of the journey. As for performance, if you have a mid or low end rig, and you have a console, definitely consider picking it up on another platform instead; as Ubisoft's track record of fixing optimization is abysmal. PC gamers still rate the lowest of the low on their list, and that doesn't seem to be changing any time soon.

Rating: 5.0/5.0 - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.

This game looks good, graphics seems beautiful. But if you don't own an i7 , you won't be able to run this game. You'll get a 100% of cpu usage at ALL TIMES, even in the main menu when nothing is loaded. Also, the game never really use my GPU, it stays around 40% usage.

So anything under an i7? Stay away from it. If you do have one however, go ahead give it a shot, you might be able to run it properly.

I liked this game until it turned into a grind fest. Did I mention that you can buy levels so you don't have to grind. I nominate Ubisoft for 2nd worst company in the world (right behind EA)

This is my first AC game and I love it. Took me 130 hrs to completed all achievements (including two DLCs). The best part of the game, I think, is the Discovery Tour. You can tell Ubisoft work really hard on researching the history and bringing it back to life. Look forward to Odyssey.

This is the best overall Assassin's Creed to date.

The revamped combat system adds skill and unique kill animations that don't hand the kills to you using the counter-system. This makes planning your attack more important, rather than jumping into a group of 10+ enemies and murdering them.

Graphics and performance are good. The game looks fantastic on Ultra settings at 1440p and I get a consistent 58-80 fps at all times. If you have G-SYNC your game will look even better.

Side quests are fun and enganging. So far I've seen a good variety with no repetitive quests back to back.

The world is immersive and alive. You can follow any NPC and they will go throughout their day as you'd expect a normal person to do, even going to sleep at night.

SO FAR (because I have not finished the game, or am even close) I would give this game a 9/10, only because the combat can be slightly clunky at times, but I still love it compared to the old system.

Will update if I feel the need over the course of the game.

I've played enough of Assassin's Creed since the beginning, and though the leveling system is different...it adds some much needed variety! Who better than to decide who Bayek should be than you? And the environments: I get lost in them, wanting to explore every bit of the open world.

If you want an atmospheric game with beautiful music and an intriguing plot, go for this one.

Pros – Beautiful scenery, It looks amazing. The atmosphere and the ambiance really make you feel immerse in the world you’re in. Just all the small details are there. Examples of one of this details, you can listen into random conversation by people near you as you walk by in the city streets or world. The world feels alive. They don’t seem to be just cookie cutter conversation templates and daily motion pattern. Both the people and animal individually feel unique and as if they all have their own objectives.

Weapons are plentiful. Really enjoy the loot component and the ability to upgrade your gear and weapons. The ability tree grows at the correct speed and is well balanced. He ability tree has tons of options and none feel weaker or over power then the others. The time it takes to get ability point feels good. It doesn’t feel like your been rushed to open up the tree. Or that it is to slow to progress.

Story and Side Quest – Story is well done and you really do feel invested in it. Side quest are so well done you really feel like they must be complete and they are greatly rewarded. One cool thing to point on are Event Quest you can find it randomly in the world around you. Although this game is not multi player it does have a hint of social element to it via the photos and event quest. Event quest are triggered when another player has died near the area you’re in. Usually if another player was doing a mission or just randomly died at the hands or an NPC. It the game will show a blue skull indicating an event quest. When you go to the blue skull it will tell you player (uplay username) has died here would you like to avenge his death. You can hen chooses to take the quest and kill NPC’s responsible for his death. If your complete it you will gain XP. and the loot the drop.

Con’s- It is a CPU Hog. Currently due to Ubisoft using Denuvo and vmprotect as anti-piracy software. One on top of another one and because of this it needs CPU power to tackle it all.
This is the reason most people complain about optimization of the game. Even I had some issues in the very beginning and spend at least 2 hours in graphic setting just to get the right balance to be able to get good graphics with good FPS. I wouldn’t get everything ultrahigh but I got a good setting I was happy with. Certainly high enough were I didn’t feel it was to great a sacrifice that it would degrade gaming experience. ( Updated: CPU Priority was change to normal with the new update 1.05 . It runs smoother!!!)

This game is a huge disappointment for me. On the surface it's everything I wanted the Assassin's Creed games to be, open world adventures through a high production value vision of some ancient civilization. Graphically the game is pretty good if you don't focus too much on actual character models or animations. Gameplay is alright. But the grind becomes incredibly apparent when they start advertising the cash shop in my single player rpg... Hard pass

Coming off of finishing Assassin's Creed Unity I decided to get Origins next. I don't regret it at all. The story is so much better. You can do a random side quest and it fits into the main story so well even if you finished the main story already.

i was impressed to see the scenery presented here. Egypt is really shown. i can't visit Egypt, but with this i can see the pyramids. i don't know about mythology in Egypt, only know the figure of the pharaoh. yes it's quite fun to be able to play this game. after completing with this i will continue with Assassin's Creed Odyssey. (but I have finished the odyssey before wkwk)

I'm currently 29 hours into this game when I'm making this review. Assassin's Creed Origins, The newest in the series. A massive open world to explore the depth of Egypt and its ancient history. If you are a HARDCORE fan of the Assassin's Creed series then I think you will be little disappointed as this game does not follows the traditional AC style but i think you will also enjoy the RPG style new AC mechanics which is completely different than previous AC's and i must say I like this . For me the last good Assassins creed game was AC revelations. I kinda liked black flag also, unity was totally forgatable i didnt touch the syndicate . This game is really a fresh start of the series and for me after lost all hope on AC franchise.Anyway here is my pros and cons of the game.

PROS:
+Big open world with alot of sidequests and places to explore
+ Photo mode is awesome :)
+ Amazing Graphics
+ awesome combat system
+plot is advancing very well so far
+ skill tree is awesome as well :)

CONS:
some little bugs etc

Finally i want to say that the HYPE was real UBISOFT did a good job taking one year gap it was WORTH IT. overall the BEST AC FOR ME AFTER AC REVELATIONS

AC Gameplay, stunning visuals, great story! I found it more appealing than Odyssey, having finished Origins and just done 4h on Odyssey. I love ancient Egypt, so I am biased.

Performance is awful, I ran it on a R5 2600 and Vega 56, it averaged 60 FPS on High Settings, but with both CPU and GPU near 100% usage, which is a shame for this hardware. Nvidia GPU don't have such a big problem, but performance is generally poor.

Skills are good, you get a bit OP at the end, I have played it on Hard with enemy auto levelling.

Great if you like these kind of games, "definitely worth a buy" (credits for Mack on the phrasing).

Let me save you the long texts and go straight to the + and - of this game:

+Open world
+Lots of side quests/activities
+Many places/historical characters to visit
+Lots of custimization options (gear, weapons etc)
+Lots of tombs to explore!

-Poor optimization (Patches of late increase it though)
-Little to no ''modern day'' storyline
-Pricy DLC (if you do not own the Gold Edition or the Season Pass)
-Helix Credits (Gambling mechanic)

I can honestly recommend this title. Although it is a different take on Assassin's Creed, you still can actually feel that it is indeed an AC game. I think that the new combat system is a really nice change. When it comes to leveling system... well I liked it, but I guess that it won't appeal to people who don't like to complete lots of side quests.
If I had to point out any cons it would be several bugs here and there and some noticeable fps drops.

Bayek/Aya deserves a Sequel ! ! !

After the Ezio trilogy... this is by far a Masterpiece !.
You have to try this game when you Really love Assassins Creed. This game is a must.

Stealth is just Perfect for this game.

First Time RPG.. Amazing Graphics / Gameplay / Story / Soundtracks / Open World / Side Missions and soooooooooooooooo much to do.

also the DLC´s are worth the money.

Simply put, AC Origins is a fantastic title that does an excellent job giving players an in-depth view into both Greco-Roman and Old to New Kingdom Egypt. The strength of the story line comes on the back of the great voice acting and story arc of the protagonist, Bayek of Siwa.

Exploring the ancient temples and pyramids across Egypt was an amazing adventure, and the new Discovery Tours feature is fantastic as you can now immerse yourself in a guide history tour of Ancient Egypt! No wonder university professors have been using it as a learning tool recently. With minimal bugs, great graphics, a solid story line with an amazing protagonist who rivals Ezio, AC Origins is a strong entry into the franchise.

The only two weaknesses, in my opinion, are (of course) the modern-day story line, which was quite flat, but that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who has played the franchise. In fact, I am glad we barely spend anytime in the modern timeline in Origins.

The second comment was regarding the Hidden Ones DLC. I felt that the story could have been a little better. The Curse of the Pharoahs, however, is fantastic. Especially loved how you could visit different regions of the Ancient Egyptian afterlife.

Assassin's Creed Origins is a truly beautiful gem in the Assassin's Creed franchise. Bayek surely earned a spot as one of my favourite Assassin's Creed protagonists of all time.

Pros:
+Excellent graphics. The in-game environment and all its characters are all rendered in beautiful detail allowing you to explore Egypt in all its grandeur.
+Excellent story. The story is very human and emotional which gives purpose to the actions of the main protagonist.
+Excellent combat when compared to previous installments in the franchise. Very satisfying when chaining together moves and using overpower attacks to execute enemies. Great use of the skill tree to keep combat fresh and entertaining.
+Great responsive controls when compared to previous installments in the franchise.
+Excellent orchestral soundtrack which truly complements the game's rendition of ancient Egypt.
+Excellent voice-over work for all the main characters. (Abubakar Salim truly brings the character of Bayek to life).

Cons:
-There were some bugs at launch. However I assume they have all been ironed out since I have not experienced any during my playthrough of the game. Note: I picked up the game a short while after launch.

Let the jaws of Sobek defend me from the darkness
To begin, I'd want to state that I have a problematic relationship with the Assassin's Creed franchise. I was never a fan of any game, and to be honest, I didn't enjoy the first one when it came out.
So, after so many years, this game finally got my attention. and... I Like it!
Despite all of my PROBLEMS with this game, I am still happy with it after finishing it.
As a major fan of ancient Egypt, Greek, and Nordic mythology, I was surprised that they finally picked that road in their new assassins creed games. To be honest, I don't believe this game was completely designed as an Assassin's Creed game. It feels more like a different project, and I've played similar games before, such as Max Payne 3. What I'm trying to convey is that, in contrast to the well-developed and gorgeous setting, this game has a major issue with the primary storyline, which feels completely phony and disconnected from the main game. It appears that they were obliged to implement all that providence stuff and assassins just to put the ASSASINS CREED title for more sells.
The world is absolutely astonishing! It is HUGE and journey feels absolutely amazing!
The number of quests, stories and locations will make your eyes roll, and while it is extremely cool, it may be a significant problem for those players who only have a limited amount of free time. Even after 100 hours, I had not thoroughly explored all of the maps and had not even begun to play any of the DLCs.
If we talk about the major issues, I want to say that the level mechanic feels really weird and might not be suitable for all gamers. What are the truly annoying aspects of this game? I had a lot of issues with the visuals in this game. I even discovered and started a debate regarding the graphics issues that I and others faced with this game. To summarize, I recommend watching some videos and reading about this title because it is not a typical assassin's creed game.

Well they were pretty serious when they said they were inspired by the Witcher 3 with this game. Combat has a fresh new reapproach which you will I either hate or love, it's definitely better than the beatemup that came from the games like ACIII.

+ Sidequests dont feel repetitive.
+ The world feels surprisingly luscious even for it being a desert.
+ The character actually looks cool without a hood for the first time
+ Hunting feels vastly improved on.
+ The blend of being able to upgrade stuff yet seek new loot is quite nice and on top of that the levels actually mean more than just restrictions to new zones.
+ Achievements are on steam for once too.
+ The game feels like it has legitimate changes throughout from your actions, bodies just don't disappear because you walked around the corner, you can even find npcs around the world from side quests that they've done and they evolve with the world, talking about what you've done for them and such and even for assassinating a higher figure you now have bounty hunters after you.
+ Still some aspects of the naval combat which feels a little more refined than before.

+- Performance isn't quite the best but I can still manage between 50 and 70 on very high with a 980 Ti on 1080p. I have a 5820k and it hasn't exceeded 60% usage.

- The combat feels a little wonky at times in such that he doesn't quite want to dodge the way you were intending, darting right into the swing.
- Stealth feels like it was dumbed down for the worst, no more crowds, and the animations for taking down someone takes forever compared to the older games.
- Microtransactions, but hey atleast they're shoved in your face only once this time I guess :(

I paid 42 euros for it, achieved 100% (no DLC)

And i must say it was worth it

Pros

* Great Graphics (some textures look like ps2 even on ultra)
* Great main character, seeking for revenge, but his state of mind is not always the same like we had in the past Connor, Arno, etc.
* Great Open world, with a decent variety of locations (no more stupid collectibles)
* papyrus puzzles
* Gladiators Arena
* Chariot Racing
* No character customization, it was amazing in Unity, we could be whatever we wanted
* A small variety of outfits, but a big one of weapons
* Monthly Events
* Tomb Raiding was a really great addition, it was one of my fav parts in AS II
* Trials of the gods
* Great soundtrack
* Nomad bazaar
* Physics

Cons:

+/- Story was more or less OK, we don't actually know much of the creed, but it was OK in general
+/- I loved the new combat, but even in Nightmare difficulty i felt it was easy
+/- Performance was decent, but again, high end PCs almost using their maximum to play it
+/- SideQuests, many were actually the same, quantity does not mean quality
+/- Parkour, not great as Unity or Syndicate
+/- auto sprint, can be a bad aspect for many players

In general, i loved the game, the new "RPG" themed AS, personally... 8.5/10

Would rate it higher, but the amount of CPU usage (100%) made my game in many situations have constantly breaks.

Assassin's Creed Origins is a great game that brings new series elements.

+Colorful and beautiful graphics
+Open World(it's really a big map)
+Parkour
+RPG(new element)
+Ancient Egypt

I like that they chose a new direction with the series to go on the RPG,brings a new good start and that's what I'm most glad to have chosen a good road.

8.5/10 It's a good game that's worth playing(but it still has some problems around here)


However, all Assassin's Creed II remains the best game in the series.

An huge map, great graphic details with a beautiful nature and real historical places, acceptable gameplay... Of course there are lots of bugs but it does not take attention too much because of the pleasure of game. So many main missions; even more side missions (really unique each other). It was one the best open world assassinate games I have played so far.

My pc has GTX 1050 Ti but the game doesn't even run. It crashes after 5 to 30 minutes. Even with the lower graphics I can't seem to get the game running for more than 45 minutes. It gets 20 fps average with lots of shutter and nothing worked. It just doesn't worth your money, time and effort.

Edit: NEVERMIND THAT! I got my game working, took me 3 years but I'm finally playing and it's AMAZING!

Easily one of my all-time favorite games, and easily my favorite Assassin's Creed game. The amount of detail and love that the developers put into this game is very noticeable. It is truly a joy to play, the game-play is fun and enjoyable and more refined from previous titles, and the story, atmosphere, graphics, and overall feel of the game are magnificent in my opinion. I truly recommend this game.

Significant bonus points if Ancient Egypt interests you.

And the Discovery Tour is super fascinating.

AC Origins, for the first time in a long while, was a truly new Assassin's Creed experience. For the better. It features a huge immersive world with a fantastic level of detail and so many little details that it does almost feel alive. The world map is probably the largest I have ever seen in a single player game and filled to the brim with things to do. To be honest, too many things to do. Or rather more correctly, too many of the same things to do over and over and over and over and over again. 78 viewpoints to climb upon? That much I can do. Doing lots of quests that send you all over the place all the time? That I can do too, even if it's fetch quests, at least the stories are interesting most of the time.

What I really came to gripe with are the several hundred of locations where you had to "find the treasure", "kill the captain(s)", "free the slaves" or "solve the papyrus puzzle". All of these things are fine and fun, but not several hundred times over and over again. After I had "completed" about a third of the game world, I already had had more than my fair share of those mechanics, but to get to a true completion, I had to spend another 100 hours just repeating the same thing over and over again. In a sense, Origins felt as grindy as a JRPG: It had it's moments, but it was quite annoying more often than I would have liked.

That flaw of mindboggling repetition aside, Origins is hands down one of the best Ubisoft games I have ever played. For reference, I did happen to have played almost all of them within the last somewhat 20 years.

Origins is a fresh start for the series, changing up a lot of the gameplay elements and becoming more of an open world action RPG. It changed so much that the "classical" AC gameplay is mostly only present in spirit, but this is a great thing to revive the series which was starting to get more than just a wad repetitive.

With Odyssey out, which was almost a copy-paste of Origins, it'll take me at least another year or so, before I am willing to go through looking for treasure and several hundred locations yet once more again, but even although I cannot be bothered to do all of that again so soon, I am already looking forward to the time when I will eventually delve into the ancient greek world.

I really did enjoy the Egypt setting, which as a setting in itself was both visually and in regard to the story something really new not only for the series but also a setting which hasn't seen much, if any, attention from triple A gaming.

This game pretty much reignited my faith in the series, which means it'll be the only series next to Final Fantasy which didn't turn into a huge steaming pile of dung or just was scrapped due to being financially unviable.

AC Origins is definitely one of the best large scale productions within the last couple of years and definitely deserves to be played. Especially by people which started to get more and more annoyed by the series or never really could get into it in the past. The series turned a new leaf and succeeded immensely with it.

Now the only two settings that are still missing are Vikings and Ninjas. It's bound to happen and I can't wait for it.

I own every single Assassin's Creed game and Origins is by far the best I've player.

Pros:
- Beautiful world/graphics
- Good combat system
- Skills tree much better than any AC game
- Great story
- Very good character

Cons:
- Some side missions are boring

This is a must have game, get it .. you'll be spending not less than 60 hours playing this game (perfectionest play-style) ..

When I started playing this game, I felt awkward because of the complete overhaul of the controls & the usual Assassin's Creed system. However, after first few missions, I started getting a hang of the system. After playing for it over 100 hours, I can definitely say that this is the best Assassin's Creed game I have ever played (Yet to play Odyssey)! Strong backstory, gorgeous graphics & simplified combat system are biggest advantages. I also loved the concept of Senu & Discovery Tour. Totally recommended for everyone who is interested in Assassin's Creed or Open World or Third Person Shooter or literally anyone who loves gaming.

Assassin's Creed® Origins is the GREAT game for me. First of all I like the old story about Egypt, the map is big and beautiful there is a lot to explore. The missions are not difficult, at least for me, I like that there is a lot of space to explore. It doesn't take long to reach at least 40 levels, at least I like the obtaining XP for any each new location and for almost everything you get a certain amount of XP. I also like the weapons you get from the mission, and from the loots. The only thing I don't like is that something has to go over HEXA Chest. I also don’t like how money is raised in the game, slow a lot. I like that there are animals in the game, and I don't like how TAMED was done, after restarting the game you don't have that animal. Sometimes I don’t like movement in the game. The bayak is sometimes coiled and moves slowly. I also like how much space there is for Fast Travel.


But in the game, I convincingly like the story of that ancient Egypt and the maps the most.

The textures of the map are perfect, but you also have good PC.. Textures on low for low PC are still good.

I like the game and I will always play it. I have to emphasize that the game sometimes reminds me of Far Cry Primal.

62 hours to beat the main story, a bunch of base game side content, and the main story for both DLCs. Money well spent. Could have easily added another 40 hours or more if I wanted to complete all of the side content in the game.

The Pros:

Graphics: the world is beautiful as always
Educational Mode: Great inclusion. A lot to learn with a great world to walk around in.
Bayek: interesting enough guy
ACP: helps skip the ridiculous grind
???: ????

The Cons:

Ancient Story: generic revenge plot, bad guys who don't matter, bad guys who don't kill you when they have the chance.

Modern Day Story: It could not be any less relevant. Am I supposed to care about my earpiece friend?

Bayek and Aya's relationship developments: That was not fleshed out well at all, 0-100 for little expressed reason.

Most of the side quests: Or all. I didn't finish them all, but every one I did was 'clear the cave'

Combat: Am I playing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ street fighter now?

Predator Missile Arrows: lol

Silly Leveling System: The worst offense imo. The story sucks, but if you ARE motivated to find the people who killed your son, you can do the next main mission! Oh wait... it suggests you should be 10 levels higher. Better go clear 7000x caves. Heaven forbid you actually try a mission/fort that is a much higher level than you. Literally impossible, can't even assassinate people IN THEIR SLEEP.

Grinding: Basically the above, but it need to be reiterated. The side quests are not side quests. They are absolutely mandatory if you want to progress the game. You have to do it in the proper order too. Find a side quest that actually looks interesting but you're level 12 and the quest is 25? Not happening. I once gave myself unlimited arrows and turned up ranged damage 400% and had to shoot a crocodile in the head 96 TIMES. 96! While CHEATING!

RPG elements: no choice is involved... why even have them? And now they're doubling down with Odyssey!

Parkour: Dumbed down and borderline irrelevant.

Aya misisons: All that time grinding to make Bayek a capable fighter and it's all pointless? We switch characters at the very end? Not to mention the nonsense shoehorned naval missions.

TLDR
I may be in the minority. I know a lot of people really liked this game, but I struggle to see much of any redeeming quality (the world, of course). I've played every major AC game and this was probably my least favorite by a wide margin. Even Unity was better aside from the bugs (and Origins has its fair share of those). The only way the gameplay works is if you follow the EXACT path they set out for you... and that's a direct contradiction to the attempt at being an RPG.

Fight me.

My playtime isn't accurate as I've put in at least several dozen hours on this game before.

Introduction
Originally, I wasn't interested in Origins at all, even though I've been a fan of the Assassin's Creed series since 2012. I was indifferent towards the new direction Origins was taking the series, and since it was a new game (I rarely get games at release) I kind of just ignored Origins for a few years. And even though I had played through the game last year, I forgot pretty much everything about it. So when I got the game again on Steam, it was a unique opportunity to experience it again and to form a proper opinion.

Let me just say this: Origins is fantastic. Both as a game, and as an Assassin's Creed game. This is a bit of a polarizing stance among fans but I don't really care. Sure, it may not have flashy parkour like Unity, it may not have ships like Black Flag, it may not have shops to renovate like Brotherhood. But Origins is such a breath of fresh air, it's hard not to like it.

Gameplay
There are some annoyances in gameplay however. Level-gating is a thing, essentially slowing your progress in the story depending on your level. There's no other way to say this; it's annoying and it's bad game design. I understand wanting the player to spend more time doing things slowly, and making sure they're prepared for whatever is coming. But even though the game tells me the "recommended level is 25", I should still at least have a fighting chance to proceed. But that's just not the case. The game will artificially limit your effectiveness based on your stats, level, gear, etc. High-level enemies will kill you in just one or two hits. And forget about assassinating in one-hit; without upgrading your hidden blade, some enemies will survive assassinations. This is bad for a number of reasons, since the hidden blade and the concept of one-hit assassinations has been a staple of the series since its inception. I really wish that the game could at least make an entire playthrough possible even if you were a low level simply by forcing you into stealth. It would at the very least give the player the freedom to go their own path rather than being manipulated into spending time away doing side quests just to advance another level to do one main story quest.

World/Environment
Its rendition of Ptolemaic Egypt is lavish and beautiful, and the tombs you can explore are mystic and atmospheric. The soundtrack is remarkable. But the thing I love the most about Origins; Bayek! I think I can safely say that he's become my favorite AC protagonist. His voice acting, his attitude, his story, and his dialogue are just awesome. Abubakar Salim did a great job of portraying him.

Characters/Synopsis
As for the main plot itself, it's certainly not the series' best, even with its strongest moments, and game-design wise there are some strange choices. There's also the obvious elephant in the room with Aya. I really wish I could've played as her more often, and her quest of justice as well as her long absences from Egypt almost makes me wonder if Aya should have been the protagonist rather than Bayek. There could have been some interesting moments, perhaps multiple locations, with not just Egypt, but the Aegean Sea (bringing back ship exploration and combat to the open world), Rome, smaller islands, etc. They could have even done something like Syndicate by having two protagonists. But I think it was for the best that there is only one protagonist in Origins, even though it honestly feels like there's two. Bayek is still fantastic, but there are certainly some missed opportunities.

As for the historical plot, it's fine I guess. But history buffs will be quick to find obvious issues, mostly centered around the depictions of Cleopatra and Julius Caesar, as well as Pompey. But those aren't relevant to my review, so I won't discuss them further.

Conclusion
Overall, I highly recommend Origins. It's an imperfect new lease on life for the series, even though it's 3 years old already. I haven't played Odyssey so I can't compare the two, but even though Origins may lack the verticality and crowded cities of games past, it still provides a compelling, fun, and beautiful world to explore with one of the series' best protagonists yet. I would even recommend this game at full price, however getting it on a sale (like I did) is obviously preferable. I've played through the DLC before but haven't included my thoughts on them in this review. If you do decide to get Origins, just make sure your CPU has adequate cooling, since this game is very demanding on the CPU.

BEFORE WE BEGIN


I had prejudgements about this game because of the combat and stealth was looking nothing like a Assassins Creed game.
I played all the games( except chronicle games) and read first 3 books of series. I tought that was not looking good at gameplay side and I had no interest in Ancient Egypt.When I first heard idea of Ancient Egypt I tought my there almost no building to run over and parkour stunts. So I waited for summer sale and I picked up the game.Even after 55 hours I still did not finised half of side quests and points of interests.




WHAT A EXPERIENCE


Damn! This game was such a cool experience. I never tought Ancient Egypt was that beautiful and interesting.
Graphics was top noch but there was fps drops in cties a lot.( I have RX480 8GB and I5 6500 with 8 GB ram)
But this fps drops are not important for me at all because every corner every site is interesting.
Enless dunes, the Nile, Cİty of Alexandria and Pyramids are breath taking. Every sunset, every city, every town is beautiful to look at.

Architecture of buildings are mixed between Ancient Egypt and Ancient Rome because of the time and its a good timeline to visit Egypt on its best. Every site touched by Romans and Greeks are fascinating but dont forget the Mysterious Great Buildings of Egyptians such as Pyramids they are also wonderful.New Dynamics such as our Eagle Senu is so much fun to look at Egypt. After I played this game I started planing to go Egypt for a visit.



IT FELT LIKE WITCHER 3


Developers took and leaned a lot from Witcher 3. Side quests, investigation mechanics, combat and looting they all felt like Witcher 3. It is not a bad thing and I dont complain about that. It feels refreshing for series and it satisfies my hunger for Witcher. Even most of the people we encountered calls Bayek as Bayek of Siwa and it reminds me Grealt of Rİvia a lot.




MAIN GAME CONTENT


There is 26 main quests, 101 side quests, 43 Military camps, 20 bandit camps, 19 tombs, 17 Villages 13 Cities , 5 Towns, 4 War elephant camps, 2 Gladiator arenas 1 hippodrome and bunch of areas to explore and loot for you. After AC Unity and AC SYNDICATE this game is a big improvement both in Size and Content.Skill tree is wide and gives you a lot options. There is 3 Main sections Warrior, Hunter and Seer. Under this categories You can unlock different skills and they will give you different advantages. For example there is a skill under Seer section that can provide you bonus money on selling items to vendors or you can go with a chain assassination skill under Hunter Sections its all up to you but at the end of the game you will probably unlock most of them anyway.



STORY OF ORIGINS



Main reason I wanted this game before I purchased it, was to see where is this messed up story in AC Unity and AC Syndicate will end-up. In game story of Bayek is good but nothing impresive. Bayek does not feel like a dominant character until the very end of the game. Aya ( Our Wife ) feels more like main character at some point through out the game.
Bayek is selfless and does not seek glory he does everybody commands he is a bit blind in most of the story. He was a simple Medjay at the begining but his quest on vengeance turned him into Father of Creed.
But there is something wrong such as Bayek Does not feel like first assassin and this all story does not fit the Glory of Assassins Creed. By the way Present day story is lame and short does not connect anything to other games and almost has no connection to Assassins of present day.For me story is only downside of this game.

My score to this Game is :

90/100



After that point there will be ****Spoilers****

We dont get connection between Desmodn, Ezio or any assassin in series with Bayek. Bayek's story does not fit the way I tought the first assassin must be. Story is simple and predicteble. There are few minor plot twists and they can surprise you at some point. For Story Caesar is Father of Understanding so called first templar but there is no dept in it. Game does not tells you everything clear and leave plot holes behind. After we kill Caesar in Rome we just leave Entire Egypt to Cleaopatra to rule and we dont see her so called ''Suicide''. We dont even hear words Templar or Assassin in the game. Game clearly does not tell you what Artifact we chase or why this people really want them. Bayek also does not know anyhing. he just does what anybody commands and wants. There is almost nothing told in present day story. we play 15 minutes in present day and it does not give any information on Todays assassins and Juno. Only for once abstergo sends 5 man to kill us in cave and we take them out. After that point abstergo klnows we are in that cave but they dont send any man to hunt us down. Only thing about our character Layla Hassan is that she is an Abstergo employee who invented a version of Animus that allows you to access any bloodline and assassin even you have no connection and with this Animus she sees the origin story of creeds establisment. The Present day story was dissappointing for me but Game itself recovers downsides of story and even puts this game to my Top 10.

Just about 2 hours in, and enjoyed the look of the game. However, there is constant lagging!
I've tried turning Uplay off, playing with the FPS limit option, rolling back my video card driver, and still the same lagging ISSUE!
On top of that, my video card is Geforce 1650 and CPU is Intel Core i5-9600. So there should be no excuses about hardware!
So pissed we cannot play this like other games...

Assassin's Creed: Origins brings you a similar game to all the previous titles, with almost all of the features added into each installment, combined into a grand masterpiece following the protagonist Bayek in the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. If you've played any previous Assassin's Creed games, the backstory continues to deliver many questions and answers at the same time. You are not required to play previous Assassin's Creed games in order to follow the story and understand it all.
The game was graphically gorgeous to say the least. The combat is fairly fluid, but had some animation problems every now and again, such as assassinating a guard through a wooden wall in very awkward poses. Though overall, I experienced far less glitching in this game than I did in previous titles.
An in-game feature called the "Discovery Tour" is like a history lesson that you wish you had in school. You'll be able to navigate around the game world while hearing various voice-narrated facts all about Egyptian culture. Not only does it offer you bunches of facts, but it also gives you insight about some decisions made by the dev. team.
One HUGE downside is the need to install Uplay due to it being a Ubisoft game. Normally this wouldn't be too big of a deal, however due being forced to launch the game with UPlay left me unable to play AT ALL on certain days. Random server outages and downtime left the whole of Uplay unable to accessed, leaving me unable to launch any Ubisoft titles at all.

7/10- If Uplay launcher weren't required to launch the game, I would most likely give it a 9/10. However the connection issues caused by UPlay Launcher and being unable to play any Ubisoft games because of it leaves me to simply warn you to be weary of Ubisoft titles as a whole due to the aforementioned reasons.

I appreciate Origins attempt to change up the franchise after it feeling very samy in the past few years and it succeeded for the most part. I still feel like it suffers from that dreaded ubisoft open world formula with dozens and dozens of hours spent doing monotonous side objectives. Origins in particular took me over 70 hours to almost do everything in the game and it did really start to get tedious around the 40 hour mark. Its very quantity over quality, I still felt an incentive to do everything because the world they created is interesting to explore and I liked seeing my character level up and get stronger. I appreciate the restraint they had this time around with collectables, they aren’t there to clutter the map any more. They make the side activities mandatory in this game for progression because of the leveling system that they added and the gear upgrading system they added where you have to hunt and get supplies to upgrade your character. You’re not going to get Witcher 3 levels of side content quality which this game feels like it’s trying to borrow heavily from with a similar leveling and side mission structure. The side missions themselves range from being decent to mediocre, there aren’t any in particular that stand out that I will remember in the future.

I like the setting of the game and it looks amazing graphically, it’s the most colourful and vibrant game in the series and the amount of detail put in the open world is very impressive. I thought the story overall was decent, it probably has the best story in the series outside the ezio trilogy but that’s not saying much honestly. The setup and prologue did an ok job of getting me behind the motive and conflict of Bayek but the story overall just felt very uneventful and it just felt like it was cruising very casually without any significant events or moments to make it interesting. The last third of the game makes up for it after a very obvious reveal but the reveal incentivizes the creation of the Creed and it was cool to see that play out. I thought the combat was a decent attempt to change things up but it didn’t feel really good to play, the hits don’t feel impactful and there is just this clunky/floaty/rubbery feeling to it, it doesn’t feel as smooth as other games with similar combat but I did grow to like it more as I kept playing. Overall I like Origins better than every AC game outside the ezio trilogy but I’m still waiting for a game that reaches that level something close to it at least.
7/10 (Good)

I normally don't like reviewing games negatively, but I feel like getting my opinion out there anyways.
As a fan of RPGs and of the old AC games, I figured AC Origins would be right up my alley. But after trying to get into the game 2 separate times, I came to the conclusion that this game isn't for me.
The side quests felt meaningless, the story tedious and the characters boring. The progression is alright and the gameplay is fun, but I feel an RPG should have a story that builds and develops, and side quests that are so good that you spend hours on end away from the main quest line.
Maybe the Witcher 3 and Skyrim have ruined my taste in games, as nothing can live up to the expectations they set for other games.

This game continues the best traditions of Assassin's Creed. The player is in the role of a peacekeeper of sorts called the Medjay. He is aided by a trained eagle named Senu. The quest begins when the Medjay's son is murdered by a group of powerful men, each named for an animal (Jackal, Crocodile, etc). The story takes place in ancient Egypt during the time of Cleopatra and she is, in fact, a character in the game. This is a completely open world game with many side missions and places to explore including hidden tombs and pyramids. Each region withiepn the game offers a different set of challenges. Some areas are completely dessert while others are watery oases with abundant wildlife. You can travel by horse, camel and also by boat. One of the missions even includes a battle at sea. There are a myriad of weapon options that can be upgraded throughout the game. They include bow and arrows, swords, axes and shields. The story of the medjay is supposedly the story of the beginning of the League of Assassins. If you are into gameplay for the story and the adventure, as I am, then you should truly enjoy the latest offering from Assassins Creed. The mature rating is because of violence and a few scenes that are sexual in nature.

The only Assassin's Creed game I've ever finished... & I mean finished too(99% completion).

The combat feels excellent, the movement is fluid & very simple, & the story was interesting enough to hold my attention. The deeper story... That has me almost willing to go back & replay the older games to find out more about!

The CPU performance is abysmal, sadly. I have an EXTREMELY fast watercooled quad core with a high overclock & could barely hold 30FPS in some of the cities. GPU trucking along just fine until CPU maxes out.

The item, movement, & combat systems are excellent, & a step forward in my opinion from previous games, but the performance needs some work...

I'm betting this game would benefit hugely from DX12/Vulkan on systems with 4 cores, & I'd like to see Ubisoft start moving in the direction of newer & better APIs if they plan to continue putting this much stress on CPUs in the future, as I've seen improvements of up to 20FPS in games like The Division 2 when going from DX11 to DX12 mode.

I was deeply impressed by the unique landscape that stretched over the entire Nile Delta.

If the opponents are on the same level as you, they are hardly your equal. Especially if you upgrade your equipment from the start as soon as you can.

In the course of the game you learn a lot about the Egyptians' cult of the dead and generally about their social life. So you get the feeling that life in this ancient age could actually have been like that.

In my opinion, the best Assassin's Creed game and one of the best games on the market. It says that It took 4 years to create this game and it's worth it. It has a huge background of ancient egypt and ancient rome history (They even made an in-game museum that you can tour around the ancient egypt and have some information about history while walking in the city and experiencing around the environment). It has a huge map that sorted in levels. Every region has levels. For example, region "A" is for between 1-6 levels other region lets say "B" is for between 35-40 levels... It goes like that. One of the best things in the game is the "auto-pilot" -this is what I called- you can pin a location on your map and hop on to your mount and command to go to the destination that you picked. This feature really makes your gameplay easier, you can give 1-2 minutes break while you're playing. Riding camels or horses doesn't bother you or 1km distances doesn't bother you. I prefer playing with controller because I played all AC games on ps4, I'm more confortable like this and it comes more handy to me. Storyline is awesome, suprisingly side quests are awesome too. There are so many sidequests and they all have their own unique storylines that I really had fun. For online feature, you can only see where other people died on map and take the quest, then have their revenge but you won't be looking around for more onlnie features because the game is huge and perfectly made. I recommend it to everyone, If you want to play a really good game this should be your choice.

Awesome game.
The 2nd game I spent more hours in (after the Witcher 3).
I made 100% of base game and both expansions.
82h in
It's like a mixture of best AC games and a little bit of The Witcher with a light combat of Dark Souls

If you are a fan of the past games, and their core mechanics. When I say that, I mean combat, assassinating, tracking. This game is really going to annoy you.

In Origins they attempted to do something new with the title, I don't mean they polished things up to make them look better. Like how the jump from AC Revelations to AC3 came with improved animation and more fluid in motion and made the game feel more loose and allowed you to go at your pace, instead of when you vault a fence, you must take it at exactly headon. You can come at it sideways and you vault it sideways.

With this, they threw away most of the things that I thought made this title something I thoroughly enjoyed. When I buy AC, I hope for AC, but I didn't really get it. See they blended it with levelling systems like an RPG, your tracking objectives uses the Owl from Far Cry Primal (I'm convinced they got lazy and cut and pasted the code) and combat that makes an eagle piloting an hot air balloon look percise. And level based equipment, so you see that nice legendary sword you got? Well you throw it out or pay 5000 gold to level it up to your current level. (That's 10 dollars USD if you'd like to just pay for it instead of grind. Oh yeah, you can pay real money to progress, cool huh? No? Didn't think so.)

Story progression is usually altogether halted by the levelling system, so you have to hunt down the side quests which offer some annoying task to hunt down in a glitchy manor, like I've had to investigate a house and there's a objective ingrained into the wall, so I have to hump it in just the right fashion until I find the interaction que pop up. And you'll be doing these about 3 times each level if you are doing missions for your own level. This game is an honest disappointment to the title and I hope that Origins was a 1 shot attempt at trying something new and creating a branch genre. Tried it, over it.

The only positive thing I have to say, is the ACTUAL assassination, when you have grinded resources and made your hidden blade 1 shot kill (For your level) and watching the cutscenes play out. Well done, but it's too bad that I've only seen a few since the game locks me behind a playtime required wall. I can't go from place to place to place and play the story out in one swoop, it blocks you off from it, which is simply an annoyance.

This game was on sale for 10% off, if I had known, I would of waited till it was more then 50% off as, this isn't the game that I had wanted, and the cutscenes and opening sequences are so obnoxiously long that it's likely they were just trying to buy time for the 2 hour steam refund to run out.

Graphics are beautiful especially if you're in the right place at the right time, and the sound is great too. Game has a ARPG style setup when it comes to weapons and gear, but it's boring, dull, and falls flat. It's nothing like playing a true ARPG. There is a grind if you don't decide on doing almost all the content - otherwise if you do everything leveling wont be an issue, and you'll actually be over-leveled for most of the content early on.

The biggest cons for this game for me is not that the world is HUGE, but it's HUGE and "empty". Yeah there is NPC's around locations, and animals roaming around etc. There just isn't anything to do other than go to every ? on the map and do the same thing over and over and over again. Area's have potential, but are let down to me because there isn't nothing to do in the area. You either clear out a camp, collect pointless treasure chest, kill pointless alpha animal. You will do that the ENTIRE game.

It's very repetitive, and boring, and can burn you out if you do not play a certain way. Basically go through main missions until you need to level up, do side quests, continue main story. Also i forgot to mention the side quests SMH. There are SO MANY side quests and it's a good and bad thing. Almost all the side quests are the exact same, but with a different flavor. Some are interesting, but 90% of them are blah.

The devs did do a fantastic job creating the world, and characters, and voice acting is great too. Sadly that's where it falls flat, because as i stated above other than going through the story it's a repetitive bore fest.

This was a great game. I spent over 160 hours in it, and it never got old, boring, tiresome, or repetitive (a few rare exceptions apply though). I don't like to do reviews about all the Pros and Cons of a game, because I prefer to think of games as bigger than just a set of items to tick off on a list.

This game felt good. The visuals were amazing (but sadly have seen a noticeable reduction in visual quality after the latest patch), and it was fun to play. I thought all the characters were well acted and voiced, and the production values of the game were exceptional.

Did it have issues, and still ongoing? I believe so, but I'm one of the lucky ones that really had no issues (that prevented me from enjoying the game and finishing it), and I enjoyed every minute of the game. The ending could have been better, but it certainly doesn't detract from the great experience I had playing Assassin's Creed Origins.

This is the first game in many, many years that I've bought the Season Pass for, so that says a LOT. I also took about 500 screenshots during my playthrough and it's now my Windows desktop theme. THAT says a lot, too.

(slight edit to clarify the "no issues" statement: they weren't game-stopping ones)

What a ride. I loved absolutely every moment of this game and I am a bit sad to be finished, but what a masterpiece. I admit I am new to the Assassins Creed franchise so I don’t really understand the hate these new games get compared to what came before. Having the experience of “walking” on ancient Egypt in as close as we’ll ever get besides hopping on a time machine has been awe inspiring and it seems to be very under appreciated by lot of the audience of this franchise.

Tbh I played this game because of the historical setting, and the assassins/ancient ones stuff was the least interesting part to me. Experiencing the drama in the lives of “real people” living through a pseudo historical story was to me a lot more interesting, and I feel is what made this game so fantastic.

I found the story, characters interesting and compelling. Gameplay and controls were easy to grasp even though I had never played any of these games before. Some very minor non game breaking bugs were encountered very rarely, and nothing a reboot wouldn’t fix. In all honesty if you have any hesitation, don’t. It’s a fantastic game and unless you are a gaming Karen you’ll enjoy it.

I'll make it short since this game already stole enough of my time.

+ good graphics
+ beautiful and very detailed open world that can be fully explored (it is too big for it's own good though)

- the gameplay is average at best and not very varied. in 80+ hours I stabbed a lot of people and climbed a lot of ♥♥♥♥, that's it
- this game is the prime example for people valueing quantity more than quality. after beating the main story and both of the story dlc's I apparently completed 181 main and side missions. this would be absolutely fine if ~95% percent of those were not utterly generic and forgettable
- the world is beautiful and can be a blast to explore but the 9 million different locations that are scattered all over the map, feel like they were mostly copied and pasted again and again. You either have to kill soldiers, kill bandits, kill animals, loot treasure or do a combination of the aforementioned things, exciting
- could be on my end but the game ended up crashing quite often during loading screens

Overall I can only give this game a negative review. It could be good but it just goes on and on and on and on... I'd rather have a more compact game that maybe only lasts 30 hours or even less but is actually interesting, than this uninspired mess.

Edit 1: Took me 7 more hours to finish the Discovery Tours, guided tours covering a huge amount of different topics ranging from the pyramids to the daily life of the egyptians. I enjoyed these 7 hours. Very informative and a nice gimmick.

This game has been one hell of a ride for me, after being bored to death by Syndicate I was quite skeptic of Origins but I'm glad that Ubisoft took their time to deliver an amazing game. This game's got CPU usage issues which I hope will be fixed in the future updates but its not such a major issue if you've got a 6 core processor.

118 hours in I can say this is my most played AC game and probably in my top 2 AC games. The main character Bayek at first seems quite one dimmentional but by the end his growth as a character transforming into an Assassin is amazing. Voice acting for Bayek was spot on. Even the enemy characters were well developed and well put together. Taking down the baddies one by one was really satifying.
While the story is quite predictable it kept me coming back for more. It seemed rushed towards the end and that's where I started to do side missions in order to progress through the harder areas which dragged out the game a little longer for me.
Havent encountered any game breaking bugs but i have experienced frame rate drops at the sync points.
The additions of Discovery Tours and 2 DLC's are really well done are are at least 10 hours each to 100%. I haven't seen a good DLC out of an Assassins Creed game since Freedom Cry so that's refreshing. Highly recommend buying at least the Hidden Ones DLC.

As far as the new combat and new mechanics with "eagle vision" i think the studio nailed it. It is now rewarding to take down a bunch of gaurds in open combat rather than a chore of wait and counter spam. There are so many different tactics to exploit and explore. Spears, swords, dual blades, sceptors, sickle swords, 4 bow types, fire bombs, sleep darts, shields, status effects and perks applied to all of the above... amazing. New is always scary at first but the team that worked on this game really nailed all the changes that were implemented here.
Stealth is more fluid and makes sense being able to crouch.
Parkouring still is a bit janky depending on what surface you're climbing. In the cliffside areas Bayek seems to get stuck then somehow clips through the rocks and gets unstuck. I've managed to get stuck a handful of times finding the perfect spot to air assassinate from and then perma-falling on maybe an object that isnt climbable. Fast traveling will end up saving your assassin. Other than than Bayek is a freak at climbing.
At about 118 hours of gameplay I had gone thorugh the story, both DLC's, discovered all locations and completed them, colected all achievments, done the majority of the side quests, and enjoyed the environment long enough to give this game the review it deserves. Enjoyed every hour of playing this game.
Pick up this game! Egypt is an amazing sandbox that will take the series to new heights. 10/10

My little Dreamativity

It's a wise decision
To hide your orIgin
When you are followed in
By some assassin

I really like this game. I didn't play the AC series for a long time before this, and this vision of the AC universe is very fresh for me and more inspiring. Furthermore, I like RPG games. I like progression, choices, etc. And AC: Origins lead the path of such elements in the AC games. Odyssey is a better version for me but still, Origins is an amazing game, and it laid an excellent foundation for the new generation of games.

The story is good. It's dramatic, has its cool turns, smooth, and looks wholesome! I like the DLCs both story and new mechanics vise. Wanna mention it here without details.

The game has a skills tree and progression system. I like it as the first step in this direction. Skills are nice and cool, though Odyssey skills are more interesting in my opinion.

You have armor to upgrade. There is still no loot system, yet you have the feeling that you can follow your story progression with both your skills and gear.

The locations are gorgeous, but I'm not much into the sand *_* But the game is beautiful nevertheless. You can meet historical persons, as in all AC games, and it's interesting to see them and some events in an AC vision.

There are Boss fights. Story bosses have different tactics and mechanics and are made cool! Also, you can fight some mythical creatures and those fights are awesome as well!

I played it long ago and could miss something but.. I remember the feeling that I like the new AC direction. Not only that, but I like AC RPG. I like this map that was interesting to explore for me (100% completion). It's different. Someone may say that it's not AC anymore and there are no real assassins. Whatever. For me, it's just a new step and a new vision, and it expands AC lore and the universe.

Origins absolutely achieves Ubisoft’s goal of bringing back their flagship franchise with a bang. The game has very few flaws and issues, and all of these are dwarfed by the strides it has achieved on the gameplay front. Origins marries the parts of the familiar AC formula that work with a host of improvements that result in an extremely entertaining and satisfying gaming experience, backed up with a great story to boot. Assassin’s Creed is back, and it’s better than ever.

It's still Assassin's Creed but it feels more like a RPG game, side quests are more interesting and have more depth, more enemies can attack you at the same time, there's no minimap, the game is overall harder and that's good. World is huge and interesting.
So... you play as a badass, you have a mount, the map is filled with question marks, there are side quests with cutscenes, there's an inventory... It's Assassin's Creed: Witcher 3. I like it.

*Advice: For those who have trouble with not being able to run the game: make sure the game is installed on your C drive first, that is mandatory for the game to work (this is the main issue that causes the game not to run and opens two different windows)

Now, about the game: loved it! It's a very well done game that is bound to be enjoyable for everyone who loves Egyptian mythology and history.

The main story was pretty basic but they delivered it nicely. For me the absolute game changer was the DLC Curse of the Pharaohs which I never expected to be this beautiful and artistic. That is a memorable experience, to be able to travel in the Egyptian afterlife, beautifully designed + the music, a dream!

Origins is the first Assassin's Creed game that I have enjoyed. The changes to the combat system and open world systems are the key reason for that. It feels like a real RPG now with levels, gear upgrades, skills, and a massive world that contains a ton of quests.

The combat was the biggest plus for me compared to previous AC games. It's a lot more action-orientated instead of the previous Arkham style combat. This change makes the combat more difficult but it also feels a lot more rewarding because you feel like a badass when you pull off good dodges that follow up with killing blows that are displayed as cinematic executions.

The world is absolutely massive and there is a ton of content within it. The map is split into zones, each with a set level range. By the time I completed the main story I still had 14 zones that I hadn't even visited yet. Each zone contains side quests, fast travel points, treasures, and various camps that each have their own objectives.

At the start I was doing every side activity I could find but they get very repetitive so after 25 hours or so I just stuck to following the main quest. That's not to say the side content is bad, it's just too much of the same for my taste. Go to area, kill bad guys, loot treasure, leave. That covers most of the non-quest side activities. If you like that type of thing though, you will probably have a 75-100 hours of gameplay in this game.

Overall, I think it's a solid game and definitely worth a play if you like open world RPGs. If you were like me and didn't like previous AC games then you may want to take another look at this game because it changes everything for the better.

Overview


Just at the moment I lost all hope with the Assassin's Creed series, Origins happened and I thank Ubisoft for that. For those who are too lazy to read this review, here is a summary: this game is immersive, the map is huge and it is waiting to be explored, every once in a while AC: Origins will make you stop and appreciate the scenery around you. Even if you are not into the AC series, try to give it a shot and decide after you watch a sunrise in the desert!

Graphics


Well, this is no brainer. The game has awesome graphics. However, in order to run the game in Ultra and enjoy it fully, you really need a good rig. I myself run the game on a midtier GPU and get 40-50 FPS with some settings on High, some on Medium. No stutter, no crash, no lag, just fluid gameplay. But I've read people that can't run the game with better rigs than mine, so I guess it is a win or lose situation. If you think getting less than 60 FPS makes the game unplayable, then you might want to wait for a patch in order for Ubisoft to address the issue. From what I've read, their anti-piracy protocols cost us a few precious FPS.

Story


I'm 50-something hours into the game and I'm nowhere near the end, but as far as I've seen, since Altair and Ezio this is the first time an AC game has a good story. We are first introduced to Bayek and learn that he is a Medjay, an Egyptian warrior that protects the people of Egypt and the protector of the pharaoh. Eventually, the story will eventually lead to the foundation of the Brotherhood and how can an AC fan not be intrigued by this? Sure, along the way we get to learn more about Bayek and the story line mainly follows his personal motives, but in my opinion this makes the game much more immersive. Do I need to say he has a very cool wife?

Gameplay and Combat


You have the freedom to go anywhere, climb wherever you want, ride as far as you can, dive underwater, explore, take a boat to cross seas or lakes, get scared the first time you see a crocodile, learn that hippopotamuses have no mercy or get stuck in a tree because you are too scared to face the lions and tigers underneath which are waaaay too overpowered for you... and I can go on. AC Origins has an interactive world and gives you every opportunity to gain experience, loot rare or legendary weapons. Almost every location has codex and if you take your time to read, you understand that you are roaming the Ancient Egypt. You get to discover tombs, you get to see the pyramids inside and out. This is a big plus for me.

As for the combat, all I can say is that it feels more realistic than the other AC games. It is almost impossible not getting hit unless you are too good at dodging and in the early game, it's not really easy. There are places that make me stop and think before attacking. Rather than barging into a camp and stabbing anyone that stands in my way, I make plans so that I don't die. Remember those missions in early AC games that make you stealth kill your enemies but you fail and decide to smash buttons, hit every direction until you succeed? Well, stealth really works in your favor in this game. Oh and using bows is a thing too! They actually work!

To be honest, the leveling system is quite limited. You can easily get all the abilities and eventually you lose interest in the build tree. There really isn't a real building system going on, maybe in the early games but as you push through higher levels you understand that you are not tailoring a build to match your playing style, there is not much to choose between.

Overall


I thought my PC wouldn't be able to run this game so I passed it, eventually I received it as a gift and I was ready to refund. Thank god I didn't make that mistake. If I knew, I would have bought it myself! So I'm giving this game a 10/10 for all the fun and the quality time it offers. I hope this review was helpful and kudos to anyone who made it to the end!

WELCOME HOME ASSASINS CREED FANS!
Ok so this game is worth the base price,fun,so much content to do and explore vast places with some cool history and story points.If you love exploring,killing guards and simple hunting this game covers that fully.draw back? i feel like i don't connect with the main character much but meh I been playing since AC1 all the way through to Unity.Uhm helpful tips I found out and can share as follows:

1)HUNT! kill all the animals even on the way to quests or guard camps,you need the stats to deal with a flood of enemies gangbanging you when you get caught.Health+melee+range damage all depends on gear and how much you upgrade each stat.

2)DON'T WASTE MONEY ON LOW LEVEL GEAR! my advice is to wait til your lv20+ to actually upgrade weapons/shields or bows because that is where you start to really see high crit numbers.I have yet to dismantle weapons I pick up for money but I am the type to buy out all mounts or clothing items first because I like to collect such stuff

3)SPEAR or SCEPTRE is newbie friendly! at first the short range weapons cost me deaths because I had yet to master the controls or unlock higher skills in the warrior tree.They also provide great reach against shield enemies which in my opinion have given my aggressive playstyle a hard time.They block alot while their friends stab you in the back,especially the bigger guys who carry resources and have larger shields.

4)TEST ALL WEAPON TYPES TO FIND FAVOURITE! I use short sword,dual swords and spear mostly as those fit my playstyle and I like the kill animations.Just see what you like and stick with those,you generally will find weapons alot so go have fun testing out what works for you.

5)DO THE DAILY BLUE QUEST (NOMADS BAZAAR) so far I have gotten 2 yellow legendary short swords with different stats and looks.Its work doing at all levels you get gear equal to your own level anyways 70% of the time from what i have picked up.

6)AVENGE OTHER PLAYERS:yea ok so I was confused to what I saw but I clicked on the blue skull icon and I killed the npc enemies that killed another player,was cool and I got experience for doing it.Id say its worth doing for exp alone the kill tree is cool but you need like 2 or 3 skills points for one perk.

7)FINISH OFF YOUR ZONES BEFORE MOVING ON. Ok so the map is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ huge...and well I hate back tracking through large areas,yes there is alot of synce/fast travel points but for your sanity just explore the zone/collect all the loot and them move on.It will save you time,trust me guys...THE MAP IS HUGE!

Ok so I was excitied for my return to the franchise,as well yea got burned out but this game and the story so far has my loving it and do love egyptian culture in general.Hopefully you all have fun and enjoy Assassins Creed Origins.

This is by far the most fun and amazing Assassin's Creed game I've ever played. And yes, that includes the first ones and Black Flag.

Simply put, the Egyptian world the game puts you in is AMAZING. It's not only full of fun and meaningful things to do, but the Egyptian aesthetic is something you've never seen in any other game before. Exploring the highly detailed Egyptian cities, deserts, and jungles, along with fantastic Greco-Roman cities, is a blast. There's just so much to do, and everything is deeply tied to its rich culture and story. It makes you feel like this ancient world is alive, and you are a big part of it.

Now, you can argue that this is the least "Assassins Creed-ey" game yet. And there's some merit to this in practice: you can indeed stick to assassinations and stealth to progress, but in general the game encourages you to use tools and weapons that encourage full-frontal fighting and aggression. The good news is that there is a deep weapon system with many types of fighting styles, and several skills and other tools you unlock as you level up. It all gives you a reason to explore, fight, look for resources and treasures, and upgrade yourself and your weapons, which is all fun and engrossing.

But even this, along with just about everything else, FEELS like Assassins Creed. The game encourages you to explore the world and uncover many mysteries tying to the lore. And there's of course an Animus story too. This is after all the story of the founding of the Order. And the story makes you care about the characters that are part of it, and you'll want to know what will become of them, for better or worse. Beyond that, all the familiar elements of the series are there, along with many new things to discover, and that's what makes it worthy of being considered a proper AC sequel.

I could go on and on about other things like how it brings Egyptian mythology to life, constellations, the Discovery Tour, etc. but the bottom line is that discovering the many things this game has to offer on your own is most of the fun. So I recommend this to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in a uniquely new, fun, and exciting world to live in for dozens and dozens of hours on end.

Better than I expected but not what I wanted.
Assassin's Creed reboot leading to the birth of the brotherhood in ancent Egypt.

The Good
The game itself is great with improved visuals, movement, and combat. Everything has been improved upon. The story is good getting to meet and kill iconic figures of history. This is the largest map for an AC game yet giving you a huge playground to explore. The down side is that you will run out of missions before seeing it all and there are several areas with next to nothing in them. That is not to say there isn't enough to do because there are a ton of items to hunt down and explore to easily get over a hundred hours into this game. But with the size of the map, there could be more.

The Bad
However, what the game lacks, like Syndicate, is online content for co-op. Had this game launched with the online co-op feature of Watch Dogs 2 where you could play with others or take on assassin contracts to defend or kill targets or other players, it would have easily been "game of the year" for me. As it is, its a great game but not what it could've been had they kept pushing the co-op of AC Unity. And due to the lack of content for the huge open world map, it feels a little empty once you complete the main story.

Recommendation
If you're an AC fan, this is a must play, especially if it is on sale.

One of the best Ancient Egypt recreations, hands down. Such beautiful scenery and great gameplay, good story pacing - the story was so so good!

This game is amazing.
From the gameplay to the lore, this game is for casual and hardcore gamers alike. The lore is extremely rich and deep and it will keep you invested. I recommend this to anyone.

An absolute masterpiece with a fantastic storyline full of passion, tragedy and betrayal, a little bit like the Ezio franchise. Great graphic optimization and rendering. Gameplay focused on one-on-one fighting. The soundtrack could've been a little bit better but hey, I ain't even complaining. 10/10

Game is amazing, definitely the best of the series imho. I'm playing with a gtx 1060 6gb, i7 4790 3.6ghz, 12gb ram and I'm playing in 1080p, high settings locked at 45fps. This game absolutely hammers my CPU. I cannot play at 60fps, even on low preset because my GPU is being bottlenecked. Will play at locked 45fps until this is addressed. The open world in this game is absolutely massize and there is so much to see and do. There's quite a variety of side activities. New combat system is a very welcome change, I love it. Loot system and upgrading is very addictive. Game is beautiful and a joy to play. I'm hooked, don't want to put it down. Ubisoft has outdone themselves! However, buyer beware because you need a STRONG CPU for this game. It's crippling most quad core CPU's and I've even seen Ryzen 7's hit 90% usage. You will have a hard time running this at high framerates. Idk if it's because of DRM or the way this game is designed but it's crazy how CPU bound this game is.

*Update: Installed the latest patch, everyone should be on 1.03 now. They fixed a ton of things and I can confirm performance has improved somewhat (about 5-10fps I think). Still hitting my CPU very hard but I can do a locked 60 fps most of the time with some drops into the low 50's. My advice is to experiment, and find out where to cap your framerate so you can run it as high as possible without maxing out your CPU.

Well, after completing this game and the DLC's i can finally write a review.
First of all, this is a good turn of events by ubisoft introducing a great new combat system, and good scaling difficulty (on nightmare difficulty enemies scales with your level).
It is amazingly huge with tons of locations and secret places on the ground, undergorund and under the sea.
The game seems different from the previous titles since the beginning. Voices are good and more accurate than before and they follow the videos and facial animations very well, both in the original english language and also in mine (italian). Music is quite good in my opinion and immersivness is what this game is all about

Pros:
- Graphically majestic, in 4k you really feel a real world
- Historically accurate (apart from the narrated part ofc :D)
- Gameplay is truly good and smooth
- Truly nice combat system
- The story of both the main game and the DLC's are very catchy and makes you feel you are into the game (not so many games can achieve this)
- Immersive as hell, i had to say a big "STOP" to my self sometimes in order to go to sleep
- The fantasy elements combine very well with the story bringing a kind of a "game of thrones" feels, which i found quite great :D
- Finally tours introduced!! History is quite as beautiful as gaming :)

Cons:
- Uplay client , pffff, the most updated/broken client in all the universe
- Come on ubisoft, i play in 4k all maxed, where is the SLI support...
- Very heavy on cpu, it is like a benchmark, easy to reach 80 degrees celsius on it, not a problem but... why?
- Not well optimized, you need a truly good pc in order to see a mid/high graphic quality
- Starting to be a bit repetitive after a while (this time after a while means 40 hours by the way :D)

P.s. *LITTLE SPOILER *
if you are an achievements runner like me, in order to get the "all location completed",
DO NOT COMPLETE ANY LOCATION WITH BAYEK WIFE WHEN THE GAME FORCES YOU TO PLAY HER

A must buy in my opinion, but with an high end pc to really enjoy it
Vote 9/10

When Assassin’s Creed Origins releases in 2017 it’s now been two years since the release of Syndicate. The intention was to take a little more time to renovate and innovate the Assassin’s Creed franchise going forward. Was that a successful strategy?

Yes, it was. Ubisoft has rebuilt the franchise into a(n action) RPG instead of the action adventure game that it used to be. And with that switch come changes. Let’s see if these were worth the extra development time.
Gone is the minimap. It has made room for an Elder Scrolls-like navigation bar and the land is now covered in fog on your map. Only walking through these foggy areas physically will show them on the map. It’s an excellent fit and it invites to actually explore.
Instead of Eagle Vision you now have an actual eagle. It can attack and distract enemies, or mark specific things. It’s a so-so addition. Using the bird on enemies is a good idea, but marking things just takes too long in general.
Reintroduced is swimming and diving. So you can now look for treasure on both land and in sea. Just like Black Flag, so another great - if reused - idea.
Optional tombs are introduced. You can’t call yourself a RPG and not have some kind of dungeons. So no question about it: these had to be added in any case.
An experience system like Syndicate’s has been added. And instead of following rather linear missions you can now accept quests all over the world. Also something that’s just a must in a RPG.
And the last thing to be overhauled is the combat system. You now have to take into account that enemies have levels. Insta-killing an enemy 5 levels above you is therefore not possible and you’ll only damage him for a specific percentage. Also something you’ll see in any self-respecting RPG.
So except for maybe one tiny thing it’s all very positive. And it really is an incredibly big game with over 150 hours of content. I enjoyed it very much, but do admit it got a little repetitive 40 hours in. I think I could’ve squeezed 10-20 hours more into it maybe, but then I absolutely would’ve been done with it.

While still not looking as great as Assassin’s Creed Unity the graphics are very colorful, sharp and detailed. The whole world feels real and it feels alive.
I don’t think I’ll ever speak ill of the voice acting or music of these games. They are always of the highest quality.
With a world as big as this come some glitches. Fortunately nothing game breaking. Performance issues were (are?) still aplenty when I played it and as far as I know these were never truly fixed.

Ubisoft has once again redeemed itself: Assassin’s Creed Origins brought new life to the franchise when it was needed most. It’s a fresh take on the genre with more than plenty of content. There are a few innovations, but the time used has mostly been spent on renovations. All in all still a very good step forward for the Assassin’s Creed franchise.

9 out of 10

Assassins Creed Origins (ACO) is an amazing game. It just misses that little something magical that would have made it one of the best games of all time. Unfortunately Ubisoft has gradually diminished the Assassins part of Assassins Creed. Now the series has pretty much become a hack and slash RPG game. It could have been so much more.

The good:
- The game world is the best I ever played in by far. No competition; hands down. Firstly, the historical buildings are stupendous - so much so that it feels fake; but it is real, I have seen it. If that is not enough, the natural environment is mind boggling - witness the transition from the black desert into the white desert - it is not to be missed.
- Finally, Ubisoft made the very good design decision to not have a lot pointless crap for you to collect.
- Finally we get a convincing AC protagonist in Bayek. I am so tired of main characters that look like they hang out in nail bars. They are supposed to be hard assed assassins for crying out loud.
- The gameplay is very smooth.
- I am ambivalent about the swordplay. I can see why they changed from the very scripted style of previous games. But unfortunately the new free flowing style does not convince. It was neither bad nor good. If anything it was way too frequent.

The bad:
- Sadly the second protagonist, Aya, sucks. She is a stupid horrible character and person.
- Bayak and Aya's story of revenge has been done before to death.
- The forced swordplay elements weaved into the main story was annoying.
- The game world is too large and the game too long, with too many pointless locations. Yet, the game world is a weirdly compressed. I mean, you can run from Giza to Alexandria in about 5 minutes. Weird.

The ugly:
- Very generic gameplay. The game lacks memorable moments. This is the big problem with AC games and why I probably won't play another one. I really miss AC1's challenging assassination missions.
- Continued crap optimisation of the AC series. My laptop would overheat after a couple of minutes. The internet explains that this is due to Ubisoft's choice of anti piracy protection. Fortunately I could avoid problems by reducing my max processor state (under power management) to 80%. Unfortunately I had to set this every time I played because the setting would reset on entering the game.

Those early reviews made me very skeptical, but I can assure you , this game is worth the price of admission. The story itself is ok, definitely better than the most recent ACs. However, the character Bayek is extremely well developed, and you will care more about him than the actual overall story. What's most incredible about the game is the open world itself, filled with details to the brim, creating one of the largest and beautiful open worlds I've ever seen. I'm spamming F12 left and right. The sidequests, although not Witcher 3 level, are clearly higher effort, and each have their own little stories and unique gameplay elements.

Most people complain about the combat, but I feel like not only is it really good, its also very challenging and different, depending on the type of weapon you're using. The parkour is extremely smooth too, utilizing everything they've learned from previous ACs and piling it all into one game. The naval combat from Black Flag returns as well. There's just so much stuff to do, and this time, it's not a repetitive grind filling the map. I feel like Ubisoft has really outdone themselves here. 9/10

As a reboot of the AC games, Origins is mostly successful. I love the core gameplay mechanics here, especially when my stealth tactics devolve into me running headlong into waves of enemies and slaughtering them. The melee weapon types on display provide a nice change-up in gameplay, though I found myself sticking with three or four favorite weapons and simply upgrading those instead of using new types I found along the way. I've found some of the bow types to be less fun to play with, but again, there are enough to match my playstyle.

The writing is the best in the series, but it lacks a certain sort of character intimacy. The focus is squarely on the shoulders of Egypt and its troubles, and while the two main characters are fantastic, their story is often shoved to the side in favor of a slightly humdrum political plot involving Cleopatra. The villains in particular are severely lacking in flavor here, as they'll often crop up only for a mission or two at most. The meta plot is still unfortunately circling the drain on the Desmond stuff, which now makes that the... what, fourth game to still be talking about his impact on the AC universe instead of making strides forward? The meta main character barely gets any attention at all, and it feels like they either need to make that more of a priority or drop the Abstergo overarching plot.

What really draws me in though is just how lively the side characters are in this game. Sure, most of them are gone as soon as you've completed a quest or two, but they're nearly all universally well written, with loads of quirks and traits that give this take on Egypt a fantastic bit of charm. It's a bit unfortunate that Origins features a ton of recycled NPC dialogue, especially in confined areas where multiple NPCs will repeat the same dialogue at the same time. It never fails to jerk me out of the experience and remind me that no matter how great this game is, there's still lots of work that needs to be done.

Overall, though, I think this is the finest AC to date. Bayek and Aya are strong characters who deserve more of the focus here, but when they're in their element, this game is absolutely superb.

I think I'm getting bored of this game which is dissapointing. I honestly believe this was a well needed breath of life into a franchise that's been going stale. Yet it's got a couple of issues that honestly ruin it, in my opinion.

The first of these issues is how corny the sidequest writing is, everything feels like a perfect world where there is a perfect Bayek shaped hole in a problem, where he can show up to stab someone or steal something and then everything will fall into place and the people he tried to help will be unquestionably better off for it. It's just so corny and perfect and a fake feeling world.

The second issue, which reinforces the first, is the levelling system. People and creatures a couple of levels above you are near impossible to defeat. At first I thought this would be a benefit to the game as you aren't going to be the baddest baddass all the time. But I'm afraid I was wrong. I found a vulture who I could spend all my arrows on to reduce it's health to 2/3s. If I stood still for long enough for it's simple attacks to hit me, it would takei 90% of my health. It didn't feel very believable. Now the biggest problem with this system is that all the quests have a "recommended level" (it's the level that the enemies in that quest will be set to). So far this is all pretty normal, BUT I'm afraid that the main story quests are spaced too far apart (in level) and require significant grinding to level up to meet the recommended level for each consecutive story quest.

Every time I want to proceed with the main story I have to stop and go looking for side quests for a few hours. It's immersion breaking, it kills the pace, it drags things out artifically and the side quests just aren't strong enough to keep my attention or motivate me to sit through them for the main story. I feel like I'm being punished for wanting to play the main story, or like I'm being tested.

Well, for me this game is huge disappointment.
I heard a lot of people praising this game as a freh start with an interisting story, good storytelling and memorable characters. To me this game has none of these.
The game is still full of boring and repetitive quests. The immersion into the story is constantly destroyed by boring main and sidequests so that i couldn't even enjoy the good quests because they felt like they didn't really belong to the same game.
The story is still very one dimensional, the main characters take side with cleopatra but the game fails to explain to me why she is the better choice for Egypt instead of her brother.
Sure, the world is huge and beautiful but the regions don't feel connected in any way; when you walk over a hilltop it always feels totaly random what awaits you on the other side.
I get the feeling that the authors don't know anymore how to finish or even continue the story in the present. To me the historical storyline is the means to finish the storyline in the present. The game doesn't deliver, again.
The birth of the brotherhood is presented in the most dilettantish way ever possible i couldn't really believe what just happened in the game when 'it happened'.
I didn't enjoy the fighting mechanic, i used bows most of the time simply to avoid it.
The story is one of revenge for maybe 90% of the game and suddenly near the end the game literally spams the word creed once every few minutes without ever having mentioned it before. It's like they noticed at the end 'hey, this is supposed to be an origin story for assassins creed'
This game fails to be the origin.

Requires you to log into Ubisoft's client ID in order to play. Took me five minutes to create and verify an account, and then it wouldn't let me log in because the system was down.

Why do big publishers do this ♥♥♥♥? 100% of gamers straight up hate it. It makes sense for some multiplayer games to cut down on cheating, but I just want to explore a fantasy world. ♥♥♥♥ off with this ♥♥♥♥.

Every Assassins Creed game I played is a masterpiece.
Nice story, excellent graphics, brilliant atmosphere that immerse you into the ages of Ptolemaic Egypt.
The beginning of the game is somewhat boring, but it gets more and more interesting as you play.
Comparing with Assassins Creed Odyssey I would say atmosphere in this one is better!

Definitely recommend this game.

Assassin's Creed Origins is one of them games people will never finish, rush to finish the main story or 100% it. I'm happy to say I 100% the main game and have gotten all of the achievements for the DLC as well.

The big part which people will always complain about is the performance because with Denuvo your CPU will almost max out usage well running this game. I can say first hand I couldn't even start the game in windows borderless because it spiked my CPU so high it that it would crash to desktop everytime well clicking new game. I played on 1080p and the only lag I could noticed was in the big cities when I was doing the synchronization points. I had around 55FPS in the Largest city well running the game on very high (outside of a few settings on high) and the game still looks amazing. If you can get passed some frame drops (because you don't want to have a 2018 build gaming PC) then you would enjoy yourself way more with this kind of game because with theses kind of graphics, comes some FPS drop.

Now for the story, I don't want to spoil anything but some parts of the story felt really good well others felt boring and just dragged on. I was one of them people that was doing all the locations the moment I enter a new area which saved me a lot of time well doing the main story. Some of the side quests stories are really fun and even shocking when you find out the outcomes of what happen. This made it a lot easier to move along with the main story when it feels dull at times. The ending I did enjoy but i'm probably one of the few who did. If you picked up the hidden ones DLC the ending does feel like it's explained more and better which helps people accept the outcomes more. If you are planning to buy this just for the main story, you probably won't enjoy yourself as much.

What do I wish they would add? Recruitments. The Hidden Ones DLC will tease this (do the 2 side missions for the achievement to see what I mean) which just makes you wish they added this to the main game. You meet some pretty interesting(badass) around the map that it would of been nice to have it so you could recruit them and have the option to bring them along for support. Another thing I would also like to see is upgradable bases with for money or even have it so you have to go around to areas of the map to get parts like in Mad Max? I doublt it will happen but atleast they know people want it.
Originally posted by UbiBoat:
I didn't know there was so much passion about having a recruitment system. It sounds like it would be something pretty hard to just add to the framework of a game, but I will definitely let the team know that there are fans that would be interested in the feature!

Overall, I say give this game a shot. Sure you might need a beast of a computer to run the game on max, but if you are looking for a open world game you can put your time into (or rush it and move on) with a lot of missions and locations to visit, this game is worth it 100% at full price.
10/10

A fresh take on series that paid off. (Contains Spoilers, Go to bottom for ratings)

I should start with positives:
1) Art Direction is beautiful. Finest in series.

2) Lighting! Most beautiful utilization of volumetric lighting that works like wonder with atmospheric fog and bleeds inside room or creates a shaft effect through branches of trees.

3) Character details and Animation. It's top notch. Facial animations especially were great!

4) Combat. I love the revamped combat system. It doesn't have parry like in Assassin's Creed Unity which I still prefer more, but it is more challenging and fun in Origins. (BUT SOMETIMES ANNOYING)

5) Loot System. Weapon variety and variable damage.

6) Bayek the protagonist.

7) Cleopatra's sass.

That's it.

OKAY BOI NOW THE CONS:

Everything else. Like literally. The story starts really slow and it feels very disjointed in starting hours.

Their use of characters is not so great. We meet Pompey once to gather forces for war. Next time we see him, his head is in a box which is shown off to Ptolemy by Caesar.

Aya was supposed to be a wise and strong woman. But she's blinded by her ambitions and ignores Bayek's suspicions about Cleopatra's help.

The members of the order don't seem to have any motive behind their deeds. It's just some cliché reason.

The only likeable villain was Septimius.

Pothinus was literally just a wind.

Flavius, the main villain is laughable. His reveal as the leader of the order was supposed to be an exciting turning point but it was stale and disappointing. No character development of him other than 2-3 scenes showing him behaving as a good lieutenant of Caesar.

NOW THE BIGGEST PROBLEM:

The RPG system. In previous assassin's creed games, we were free to go with the continuation of story whenever and however we want.

Here, you gotta be Level 35 to complete the ending mission. Why's that bad? It breaks the experience really badly.

Before the ending mission, when the excitement of the finale was extremely high, they show the level requirement of 35. I was 33.

I had to go do some side missions of stealing herbs from Roman barracks, free prisoners held in random camps and kill some captain who never did anything wrong to me. Probably spent 2 days doing 5-10 missions coz I was playing on Hard difficulty and had to explore a lot.

ALSO WHY DOES A STRONGHOLD OR FORT HAS ALL GUARDS RESPAWNED?? I LITERALLY KILLED THEIR CAPTAINS AND ♥♥♥♥.

The excitement of finale died with tedious side missions just so I can level up and play the final mission otherwise the guards will keep pawning me and I'll keep desynchronizing.

The main story doesn't make use of the whole map of Egypt. But side missions do. Which was pretty much fun but I kept discontinuing because it got boring and repetitive after a while.

The game itself is about origins of the Assassin brotherhood. It pretty much does portray it in an impactful manner. Thanks to Sara Schachner's rendition of Ezio's family theme, the cinematics in final hour felt epic.

So, how it is compared to Ezio Trilogy? Pretty stale. Bayek was a good protagonist, but compared to Ezio who transitioned into being a mature and wise assassin, Bayek stays the way he was at the beginning of the game. Haytham, Connor, Arno, Frye Twins all had some good character development. The writers just didn't do any justice to Bayek's character.

The game is a solid RPG but it can be seen that it's heavily influenced by The Witcher 3.
The series has transitioned from a sci-fi fantasy hybrid action adventure game to a fantasy RPG.

With a lot more addition of ancient Gods and demons and missions designed around it, the charm of Assassin's Creed has completely vanished. I have a sword that has a permanent fire to it, lol. How's that possible? Let's just play it out as Animus feature.

Modern day story is still trash. No connection to Layla. The previous two modern day protagonists are not even mentioned.


So here's my final score.

Graphics: 8
Other than lighting that makes the environment look amazing and facial details nothing stands out. Textures aren't so sharp all the time. But I love the Screen Space Reflections on water surfaces.

Presentation: 7
The world is vast, the art direction is top notch. But missions designed around it aren't that great. Although, love the details like raining insects and storms. Tombs and Audio logs in few locations addressing post Desmond world is interesting.

Audio: 7
Love the soundtrack. But nothing that will stay in my memory for long. Voice acting is great.

Gameplay: 7
Combat is amazing, but oh god I hate it when dodge doesn't work. Hunting and crafting was a cool thing. Character skill tree was very enhanced and feels a lot like Far Cry 4's skill tree, which is a great thing and a significant addition.

Story: 5
Not a big fan of the story in this game. I loved Bayek, but none of the characters is strongly written.

Overall: 6.8/10

It's a good RPG game but doesn't offer anything different than just being another RPG game. Previous entries felt different and had their own identity. Now, it's just like any other RPG set in AC universe. My opinion is with respect to previous AC games.

I don't hate this game. I'm playing it even after completing the main story and that's because it's a solid RPG game to pass the time. It's just not a good Assassin's Creed game in terms of story and if you were ever interested in modern day arc and whereabouts of Juno (the main antagonist of modern day) then you'll be very dissapointed as I am.

Some people might miss the social stealth elements like eavesdropping, stealing and blending in crowd for information about targets but I ignored it since the game doesn't address the existence of assassins till the end of the main story.

Tbh, you may agree or disagree with my concerns about this game, but it would be great if we just discuss it instead of calling out on each other. I wrote this review after completing main story. It took me roughly 50 hours to complete it because I was raiding tombs and caves for loot. I didn't rush it until later stages of main story because I got bored of grinding.

So yeah it's a 50/50 game for me. I had fun but I have lot more questions by the end of the story and salty coz Ubisoft omitted the entire modern day arc assuming that everyone reads the comics.

Anyways, glad if you find this helpful. Happy gaming lads!

A stunning recreation of ancient Egypt, Assassin's Creed Origins revitalizes a tired franchise. Improved gameplay, a bigger focus on player interaction over automated systems and an insane attention to detail make this game the best in the franchise. Well worth a play.

Incredible graphics and purely immersive on a 4K screen. I'd say that where this game shines is the exploration and leveling up, etc.... The map is a really decent size and the gameplay mechanics are great. It's not the best optimized game in the world because when playing on a GTX 1070 in some of the more populated areas I get frame drops down to the 40s. The story was okay. Starts out strong but then just gets boring.... I actually found all of the side missions to be more fun that those of the story. I really wish the game had a more decent soundtrack like the first several assassin's creed games.

Actually not that bad as everyone expected it to be. Granted, i went in with minimal expectations, but was pleasently suprised by this game. Its starts up painfully slow, with nothing Assasiny in sight, and wants to make you familiar with the Egyptian world. This world is very well crafted and looks magnificant. The tombs, the pyramids and just the sheer landmass is a beauty to traverse. Sadly, as with most Ubisoft games, thay fail to make that world feel like its actually livable.

In early production they said they wanted to make a 'Witcher 3' kind of a open world game, but they fail to make it believeble. People just stand and walk around. Don't really act like real human beings and all scream to each other. Every time you encouter a guard somewhere he seems to be angry at you and screams some insults. This is totally gamebreaking because the gaurd in question has no knowledge about you whatsoever. Small irritations like this is Ubisofts hallmark. They create vast world but lack the finesse to really expend on them and make them feel believeble.

When you get past this point the game opens up. The story picks up and really sucks you into it. Bayek, the main character, feels like a real person with strenghts and weaknesses. The main quests feel like they have gravity and are a bunch of fun to play through. If you have a love for old history make that double. Its great to feel involved with real world history and have a hand in shaping it. Very well executed.

Side quests are a mixed bag. Again i will be refering to the Witcher 3. All the people that give you quests feel real and believeble and have awesome dialouge. Not here sadly. A fixed camera angle and a not so interesting sob story dont get me in the mood at all. Turn off.

The open world map is way to crowded with points of interest and side quests. I dont really feel like its soemthing for me but i do understand the appeal. A LOT of hours can be spent and thats a real good investment for your time.

Combat has been revamped and is now somewhat more then jsut pressing 'attack and counter' like the previous AC titles. Its worth to invest some time in it and get good at it, certainly at higher difficulties the combat is sporadicly unforgiving. Something that i enjoyed.

All in all a solid 7/10. Enjoyed it enough to give it a thumps up. If Ubisoft takes the negative points and imrpoves on them the next game could be really good. Lets hope so!

I have an i7 7700k, an Asus GTX 1080, 25gb of RAM. and I'm playing from my Samsung 960 pro 1tb M.2 SSD.
Trying to play it on my 3440x1440 100hz Asus monitor. and I got MAX of 15-17 FPS. That has got to be one of the most ridiculous thing I have heard or seen. This is such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I paid good money (Pre-ordered the Gold-Edition) to have something that is at least PLAYABLE, which this is not, in the slightest.
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!

Also, this was on day one, two, & three....

Ubisoft's version of Ptolemaic Egypt is astonishing, it really makes you want to wander off the beaten trail and explore the whole map. Main characters are well developed and make up for those who fall short. The combat takes a bit from the Dark Souls formula, say, attack a couple of times and fall back and the classic strategy of moving in circles around the target's back. I'm actually glad the plot is very personal for the characters this time around as I felt in previous games it was mostly a meaningless excuse to join the assassin monks. A few points off for Denuvo getting in the way of performance.

Did not expect this game to be so good. Ancient Egypt looks beautiful and I'm just lost exploring everything. The main story is interesting and i'm digging Bayek, he reminds me a lot of Ezio from AC2. Doing the sidequests and exploring does make you feel overpowered after a while but i don't mind that. You can approach a mission slashing nd hacking or you can stealth your way around.

I tend to do the main mission and the side quests around it and I'm enjoying the side content helping the locals with their silly problems. I think this is the best AC Creed game i've played since the trilogy and Black Flag.

This one took a different route than the whole series. Gameplay is much similiar to The Witcher than AC. Combat system is more of Dark souls style. You can climb almost everything. Still, i like it.. Not as an AC game but as a standalone game. I have played every quest there is, every errand and every possible event and i'm still craving for more!

* Story/World is good enough but not as immersive or accurate as games like The Witcher and Horizon.

Took me 38 hours. Easily the best AC game, solid 8/10. Learning of how the Assassin's Brotherhood and the Templar Order were born was great and the stories behind them were amazing. You also find out who The Father of the Understanding is which was neato. The fighting is back to the OG style of dodging and timing, making it more realistic and fun than the constant blocking and parrying.

Very much enjoyed, a lot to do once you've finished the main quest. Well worth the full price.

I cannot begin to understand why a game would be released in 2017, and run so poorly on current generation hardware. The game runs suboptimal on an i7-7700k and a 1070. Every 10 seconds I was experiencing a frame rate dip and a stutter that just distracted me from the game.

I cannot in good consience reccomend this game to anyone on the market right now. The Double dipping on the DRM will make this game push your CPU to its knees and come to a crawl.

Please avoid until Ubisoft decides to patch/fix this game breaking issue.

Assassin's Creed : REBOOT

Alright, this game has changed Assassin's Creed Franchise for good & this is one of those rare times when an new approach executed perfectly.

Truth be told, I didn't actually "enjoy" any of those OG Assassin's Creed games. As an new era gamer, those game were rather inconvenient to spend time on. I actually kinda expecting this kind of Assassin's Creed experience when it comes to gameplay. Now look, I don't take anything away from those game... They're timeless legend with amazing story & plot.

It's been a while I stopped playing this game (got busy I guess) & now I can't exactly remember the pros & cons but what I can do is, solely recommend this to everyone who haven't purchased it yet & explore Egypt, at its best in video games history :)

Played few hours so far, absolutely amazed how attractive this game is!

Here is what I see so far:
- Pretty graphics, large word, many details. Playing mostly on high settings and getting constant 80-90 fps with no performance issues whatsoever. There are plenty of options to be configured to match your rig. It calculates required memory vs your VGA memory and shows FPS graph to get an idea.
- The main character, Bayek, despite previous two AC games is very interesting, really eager to see what will happen next.
- Fights are not easy, especially against high level opponents. Need to use different mechanics, use different tactics, etc.
- Side quests so far are not repititive at all and are actually interesting.
- There are different exotic animals roaming the word, dogs barking, cats following you, etc. Creates friendly atmosphere.
- There are micro-transactions, didn't use myself, but checking items from shop and items achieved from some side quests have an impression that quests provide better equipment.
- This game reminds me of Black Flag (very similar areas and models sometimes) and of first AC (the way city feels, the way people talk, the way croud feels alive).

Enjoying the game so far absolutely, time flies faster than i blink. Will add more details after finishing the game.

Assassin's Creed Origins follows a familiar paradigm that will keep you involved and hold your interest level for enough time to at least justify a purchase. The game is set in Ancient Egypt and you're fighting for the rights of those that have been captured and held under the will of ruthless powerful forces. You have a great set of weapons, and there are lots of cool side missions. Moreover, the game has a beautiful landscape and a very large map. The graphics are excellent although even with a powerful computer you can find that the game stutters occasionally. That all being said, after completing about 80 missions, this game got too redundant for me to complete in its entirety. Some of the villains can only be taken down through a series of repetitive and tedious attacks; this greatly retracts from the pace of the game. Other quests require you to find objects located on the map, which at first may not seem like a chore, but on your fifth or tenth such mission--it becomes a pain. All in all, it is worth a buy, but it is not worth $60.

Been an Assassin's Creed fan ever since it started. Sure, it doesn't feel like a true 'Assassin's Creed' game. But it is a damn good game.

Pros:
- Graphics: Everything is beautiful. Look at the flames! The desert. The interiors etc.
- Content: Witcher 3 levels of content.
- Animation: The animations in this game are pretty decent, kinda what i would expect from AC.
- Attention to detail: So many nitty gritty details in the game, like villagers sewing, eating, selling goods and gathering herbs etc.
- Tits: There are topless women npcs in this game. Lots of them.
- Photo Mode: This combined with the above two pros make photo mode godsend.
- Ancient Egypt: The locations in this game are amazing, reaching Alexandria and climbing the Lighthouse of Alexandria is amazing. There are many many more locations such as the Pyramids of Giza, Memphis and Thebes(DLC) etc.

Cons:
- Performance: Not bad, but could have been alot better.
- Story: its Ok at best: though some will disagree with me.
- More of An RPG than a Stealth game: Don't expect this game to play like previous game, is feels more like an action RPG than a traditional stealth game.

The game is slight grindy to some, though i have not faced this issue as i constantly get distracted and do the side quest. There are microtransactions but they can be largely ignored as they are not a game changer.

Verdict: 9/10

Really FUN game. Awesome graphics and a really big game world in Egypt to explore and search for hidden antic treassures makes this Assassin's Creed adventure something special. It's actually my favorit AC game and Egypt is absolutely stunning to experience with an fantastic atmosphere. The map is the same size of the UBI game (Ghost Recon: WildLands), so it's massive in size with extreme amount of content for the player to experience. With cities like the famous & big Alexandria, the old atmospheric city of Memphis, mysticl Heraklion & the city Krokodilopolis, there is so much to explore and special moments to experience in the gigantic beautifuly & sunny world of hot Egypt. There are also several smaller detailed villages, hot dry & sandy deserts, big pyramids to explore for old valuble treassures, high rocky mountains, beautiful lakes & long curvey rivers, deep swamps where dangerous crocodiles searching for meet, plus much more. The control and feeling over the character "Bayek" as you play as, feels tight and responsive. Good sword fighting also.
_________________________
The game runs well on my PC:
_____________________________________
Intel i7 6700k,, Asus GTX 1070,, 32 GB DDR4,, GigaByte z170,, Windows 10.
I play the game @ Ultra settings @1080p 24" monitor with no problems so far. Well optimized game.
______________________________________________
I like that UBIsoft implemented Steam achievments in this version also. You still needs Uplay launcher to play but that doesn't bother me. UBI should also get credit because they allow us customers to buy their games here @ Steam Store or even @ EA Origin so we, the players, can have a collected games library. That sucks big time of EA where you only can play on their platform splitting up your game library. I prefer to have all my games here @ Steam launcher.
______________________________________________
:::::EDiT::::: As of today UBIsoft has removed their new games from the Steam platform and now only releasing their new games @EPiC Games Store & Uplay. They have become greedy a-holez.


** Well done UBIsoft. Assassin's Creed is now back on top. Can't wait to continue my journey as the protagonist named "Bayek".

Assassin’s Creed Origins is a deep-dive into a truly stunning realization of ancient Egypt, with a rich series of cultures, genuine characters, and more mission variety than any other game in the series. The combat is challenging and thoughtful, and while the loot system doesn’t match up to games like Destiny 2, there are enough different, weapon types and enough enemy variety to keep you swapping between weapons, catered to the situation. The RPG elements encourage challenges of their own, and even despite a handful of bugs, I desperately wanted to keep playing.

First,I want to make an apology for my english.I am in the process of learning it so there might be grammar mistakes.

The game is better than what i expected.Beautiful story,so many locations to visit(which you can also have fun),diversifications of weapon types and weapons,long gameplay,controlling your eagle to check the perimeter,great graphics,nice details both on gameplay and on the game’s physics,random hallucinations on desert if you get heat(there are so many hallucinations which is great),level system and many other things made me love the game.

BUT

The game also has many problems.Like random crashes(specially after the windows updates). Devs dont care about it,so if you ever encounter with a problem,you are on your own! The people who works on support of ubisoft forum seem like they dont know anything or they simply dont care. I had this crash problem and it took me 3 weeks to solve it(wasted 2 weeks by talking to support unfortunately). Also there are not various AI faces,everyone looks alike to each other.And the voices of every single character(during speeches)is really really bad,sometimes it gets on your nerves.

So in my opinion,the game is great after all.However,it is bit of a gambling.The game might crash and become unable to play.So i dont suggest you to buy it since they solve this problem(which they probably never will).And i also dont like both ubisoft and ubisoft workers so i recommend you to stay away from this game.

Firstly it's really starting to annoy me with people saying it has performance issues, i have been playing the game for over 50 hours now and have had over 80 FPS with ultra settings everything max and it never dips or lags even in big areas like alexandria. Now to the game.

Pros :-

-Big map i mean absolutely huge and vast with different areas even spots where a white desert meets an orange one.

-A massive amount of stuff to do i mean i have just finished the campaign and still have a crap ton to do.

-Beautiful game the graphics are absolutely amazing everything about the game is perfect graphics wise no popping or missing textures.

-Much better combat system.

-The animals and npcs are brilliant with animals feeding, hunting and eating and not just sitting in one spot doing nothing but waiting for the player. Soldiers in forts, outposts etc will take roting shifts where i watched someone who was a sleep get up just as someone was going to sleep and then proceeded to man the post on the wall which became unmanned, adding to realism.

-The general enviroment, when travelling through the map you can see wind pushing sand across the floor like it would in real life and there can be the occasional sand storm which can be seen from a far distance away.

-The lighting for one is amazing standing on a cliff looking down at a city in the dark is amazing the lights flickering with the stars above best i have seen in a game based in the past.

-And finally the general levelling up system is great you start off slow and it is a bit of a grind in the middle but one past the middle the game is much easier you can eat through bases once too hard to do so giving you a sense of accomplishment and phylakes (very hard bounty hunters looking for you) i found i was hunting them than them me nearer to the end of the main quest which made hunting them fun.

Cons :-

-There aren't any the game is bloody brilliant from the story to the graphics well worth it and with the plans to add an entire new section to the world based on rome gives you something to work towards

P.S I am running a GTX 1080 and an I7 6700K, I aswell had no issues on start up once downloaded the game loaded straight away i started the game and i was off no issues at all.

By far my fav AC game ever.
The reason why i love this game so much is because of map which is set in Egypt.
Well the land of Egypt hide many secrets.....u have a lot to exploreand u can be detective sometimes to find out what happened.
-Gameplay- Well u can explore land and water secrets, doing side quests, clear outpost.....10/10
-Combat- Well i can say its great u have 2 types of melee attacks (light attack which is fast but weak) and ( heavy attack which is slow but strong.
-Weapons- Dual daggers, , spears, scepters, dual sickle and regular swords, bows..........
-Outfits- Altair, Ezio, Edward Kenway, Hunter........
-Dificulty- hard sometimes

-Graphics- 10/10

buy on sale and enjoy!!!!!

In a typical AC game, we are given one large town or about three small ones to explore and cut some throats while continuesly getting a better weapon. This time there is an RPG element, upgradable gear and the freaking entire kingdom of Ancient Egypt to explore. Map is massive and apart a couple of deserts, all regions are filled with content, varied ambience and changing architecture. I can't even start believing how much time it took designers to make this game.

What particularly pleased me is that I was allowed to focus on the actual game with very littler distraction by the drama of the modern day Assassins. Hopefully in the future games it will be possible to configure settings to "Please allow me to play the main game and spare me from the modern day storyline, thank you". :)

I definatelly enjoyed this particular AC game and will pick up the Season Pass during a major sale.

As a longtime fan of the series I REALLY wanted to love this game, but I just can't. The three reasons being:

- Absolutely game breaking performance issues on a relatively high end PC (as of playing in 2018).
- A very significant amount of boring content and extremely dull/repetitive side quests (which are necessary in order to reach main quest level requirements).
- Fundamental changes to the combat and formerly fluid assassination/stealth mechanics that made the AC series a unique hack-and-slash staple for over a decade.

While I admire the series for doing something different after a few forgettable releases, this game is just flat out not fun. My biggest issue is that it simply feels like an obviously cheap imitation of games like The Witcher 3 and Dragon Age. It's an incredibly detailed and visually stunning world that feels unfortunately lifeless and empty, completely devoid of any compelling characters or quests whatsoever (and this is after 35 hours of playing). The side quests are among the worst that I've ever seen, completely pointless and repeatedly following the same formula of some useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ either getting you to go fetch something or to go help/kill one of his equally useless and forgettable associates. The fact that you're basically forced to explore and endure these "quests" in order to reach a high enough level for the main missions is borderline infuriating. If you can get past these issues there'e also the combat. Replacing Eagle Vision with Senu-the-ancient-drone completely destroys the pacing while you have to scout an area for 15 minutes straight just to ensure that you didn't miss a random guard (it's also incredibly ironic that the series that basically created Eagle Vision no longer has it despite both The Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, possibly two of the greatest games of our era, both implementing almost identical systems that were clearly based on it. Does Ubisoft legitimately not know what it had?). The combat, while a good system overall, is much more methodical now. While many might prefer this, it also makes fights very drawn out and slows the pacing down even further. I'm also really disappointed that this game undid the incredible technological pioneering that we saw in Unity in regards to the massive crowds and incredibly realistic movement animations/physics as well as the really neat 4-gear slot customization that it had (I'm not going to argue that Unity is a better game because it just flat out isn't. But I always see just about everyone unfairly ignore the few amazing things that it added and did actually do really well).

Don't get me wrong, the main questline and modern questline are fantastic (one of the best in AC). The main story started out pretty strong and it would be great if I could actually get to play it despite feeling absolutely nothing for any of the supporting characters that I've met so far. Again, the problem is literally everything besides the main story. The changed combat/leveling system, rather dull exploration, and completely ♥♥♥♥ side quests all serve only to bog down the overall experience and turn it into a complete slog. It makes me feel as if Ubisoft doesn't really understand that the best and most fundamental part of RPG games in the first place is good side quests and exploration/world building. Combining Assassin's Creed's combat/parkour with it's incredible historical settings should have been lightning in a bottle with their new RPG formula. Hell, the games were already just a few side-quests and dialog choices away from being RPGs to begin with anyway.

Overall, it's neither a great nor terrible game. Would still recommend it if you can pick it up between $15-$25 but it's still far from my first choice. Still objectively a pretty solid 7/10 (how typical of Ubisoft, though they seem to be improving). It's really lost the soul and feel of Assassin's Creed games and has made me a bit apprehensive about future titles.

I played this game before on PS4, but when played on PC the first time. AC Origins looks and feels awesome on PC. I can see me going hard for another 60 to 70 hours.

If you are looking for a continuation of the story of the previous AC games, you won’t find it here. Then you are looking for the Assassin’s Creed: Uprising comic book series. Yeah, that's how they chose to finish up the story.
If on the other hand you are looking for a big budget open world game set in Ptolemaic Egypt, this might just be the game for you.

This new entry in the series really has more in common with The Witcher 3 than previous AC titles. At least some parkour elements are still here. Everybody won’t like this change. The new levelgating can be particularly annoying since it more or less forces you to “grind” some side quests in between every main story mission. Sadly, the story on offer here is quite underwhelming. Especially towards the end where all the big historical events take place, everything feels extremely rushed. Ubisoft still seems afraid of having any longer cutscenes interrupt your gameplay and the story really suffers because of this. Considering the almost ridiculous amount of side quests in the game, perhaps some more time should have been spent on the main story instead.

Their recreation of ancient Egypt on the other hand leaves very little to criticize. If you have even a passing interest in ancient Egypt, you owe it to yourself to experience this game. If you feel like doing this without slaughtering half of Egypt the game's new Discovery Tour feature is a great way of doing this. You might even learn something in the process. This really is an amazing feature that should have been a part of the series from the beginning.

All things considered, while I'm not the biggest fan of this new direction the series is taking, no one recreates historical open worlds quite like Ubisoft. Hopefully with the recent shake ups and firings over there we might get a proper story set in one in the future.

Not the best one I've played, but still enjoyable.
I liked the RPG style they introduced in this one. Felt like a good change to the series. The story was fine but not memorable.

And of course, after true Ubisoft fashion, bugged achievements. Took me some time, but 100% completed it anyway, because the achievements in itself were not hard.
7,5/10

Origins is far better than Odyssey in my opinion. I find it has much better story and side quest story than Odyssey, feels more like you are actually doing something that fits the era and you are helping simple people. Much better writing and the quests are easy and sometimes you even have to find some hidden side questline, which even further enhances the mystery that is Egypt.

That said even in the visuals, I find it has something that they didn't include in Odyssey, like for instance there is far better depth of field and sharpening, also the colors are more vivid and it's just a blast to explore the beautiful landscape, then the sand particles when you ride a horse are visible and wet mechanics.

The only thing i find a bit lacking for my taste is the level of customization. You have only a handful of weapon visuals and a few same clothes but a bit different texture to them, which compared to Odyssey where you have more of each.

And you can ride a camel, horse and even chariots!

Overall the game is pretty long if you explore it more, but you can finish main storyline quite fast. For all the Egypt fans this is a must and the built in Discovery Tour is just a blast to listen to and educate yourself on some of the history.

This game just look amazing! Graphics get a 10/10 and it runs just amazing on my pc so performance wise 10/10. The story is really strong and keeps you interested so the story gets 10/10. The only real negative thing I have to say about this game is that the new RPG style of assassins creed... I'm not really feeling the new RPG style. I really liked the older games mechanics better. I also thought the combat wasnt as nice and fluid as some of the other games. Overall i'd give this game a 8/10 rating just because the only thing i wasnt fond of was the playing mechanics but otherwise the game was amazing and i'd reccommend it to other people.

AC:O REVIEW

Unul dintre cele mai tari jocuri assassins creed , depasind chiar si Ezio Trilogy
Acum personajul principal este Bayek Of Siwa, ultimul medjay ramas.

PRO
+Gameplay
+Combat ( Mult mai complex si mai dinamic )
+Poveste ( SUPER SUPER nu dau spoilere )
+side quest ( fiecare side-quest are o mini poveste ceea ce nu te va lasa cu ochii in soare)
+HARTA ESTE PLINA DE MISTERE ( Cand te apropii de cele 3 piramide vezi o gramada de miraje)
+FOARTE MULTE Side-questuri si eventuri ( ceea ce te tine in joc muult timp )
+Luptele navale ( nu sunt ele asa multe , dar sunt satisfacatoare )
+Bayek ( Baiatu bun la toate )
+Aya ( Fata buna la toate , mai ales la luptele navale )
+Sountrack-ul ( Return of the medjay sau fight theme , doar ascultati-le si vedeti singuri c.u m este sunetul din joc)
+Senu are un rol important in joc
+Locatiile din joc sunt modelate impecabil !
+NPC-urile ( Pur si simplu lumea din joc este mult mai dinamica )
+Ciclu Noapte- Zi ( Iti poti seta c u m vrei sa fie in joc, ziua lumea e mai dinamica si daca ai o misiune de asasinat nu stiu ce general dintr-un campus, o sa-ti dea de furca pentru ca toti garnienii sunt la posturi si iti va fi mai greu de intrat campus, in schimb daca faci aceasi misiune doar ca de data asta pe noapte , o sa-ti fie mult mai usor pentru ca garnienii si generalii vor dormii si iti va fi mai usor de intrat in campus )
+Photo-Mode ( Daca vreti sa faceti o poza de neuitat si s-o publicati pe Steam , pur si simplu folositi acea unealta si puteti sa faci poze de neuitat )
+Modern-Day ( Este ea foarte saracacioasa, dar sper ca in viitorul joc sa fie mult mai multa actiune si poveste , pentru unii oameni aceasta unealta o sa ii lase cu un gust amar)
+Sistemul De Skill-uri
+Sistemul de iteme ( Pana la urma e un RPG nu? Asa ca te vei bucura cand vei gasii un arc Rar in mijlocul desertului )
+Inlaturarea mini-mapului
+Crafting


-Optimizarea ( bine au mai rezolvat-o ei din ultimul update)
-Buguri ( C u m ar fi ca o femeie sa se plimbe cu o caruta cu boi si dintr-o data sa se invarta ca o balerina)
-Grafica( Uneori grafica este dea dreptul...naspaaa) dar are momente cand grafica este WOW

CONCLUZIE
IN SFARSIT SERIA AC A LUAT-O PE UN DRUM BUN si bine au facut ca au amanat jocul un an ! Ma bucur ca nu am mai vazut un UNITY pe ecranul meu cu o poveste de dute vino de te lasa cu ochii in soare !!
POVESTEA IN ACEST JOC ESTE FOARTE CLARA SI CARE TE TINE IN SUSPANS !!
SISTEMUL DE SKILL TE VA FACE SA UMBLII DUPA FIECARE MISIUNE DOAR PENTRU A FACE LV UP !
ACEST JOC CHIAR ESTE SUPERB ! DEPASIND CHIAR SI SERIA LUI EZIO !
Din cauza optimizarii proaste pe pc si din cauza norilor care zici ca-s din plastilina ( In Brotherhood norii sunt muult mai reali ca aici ) am sa scad din nota finala

PENTRU ASSASSIN'S CREED ORIGINS DAU NOTA 9.5 !

A da acum ma duc sa termin cele FOARTE MULTE misiuni ramase pe harta ! Cya :*

Assassin's Creed® Origins Final review . Took over 120h and still didn't finish alot of activities/side quests. I'm a huge AC fanboy but i will give my honest review. I'm gunna start by saying

Assassin's Creed: Origins is a great game with quite good amount of RPG elements in it's gameplay, completely new combat that's way better than last ones, really good main story with a lot story rich side-quests, stunning and one of the best open world out there.

Story
Origins unveils the story of Bayek, a medjay. Medjay's are the protector of the people of Egypt and true to the Pharaoh. Starts with the fall of Egypt and Bayek's people. To avenge his son and the people bayek starts his journey. With friends and family he continues uncovering the truth. As we follow through his jounrney, we come to know how the brotherhood was created. The story starts slow but catches up pretty quickly. It's best best story in recent AC games. Better than Black Flag IMO. The ending was absolutely amazing! I still feel like we needed more. Even tho the story was really big, we are left with wanting more. But that doesn't make it bad in any way. It's a great story overall.

Gameplay
They completely renewed the gameplay. The parkour is same but the fighting, exploring and every other aspect of the gameplay is changed. With RPG elements AC added their own touch, which was needed so that it can make the people happy that loved the old gameplay. The Combat is inspired heavily from Dark Souls. The gameplay is quite smooth and they fixed the bit of animation problems it had at the E3.

Skill Tree is something AC Syndicate had but it wasn't that great. Origins actually makes you wanna upgrade to the maximum skill. The skills are extremely useful and at some point they are must. Different skills gives access to different gameplay style which is really good. I love this skill tree and pretty sure everyone will like it.

Crafting They didn't make it completely RPG so the crafting isn't that hard but the resource needed for crafting is hard to get. For that you can open chests around the world, go after cart raiding or just hunt which is really fun. Overall this is not something huge but it's there.

Customization is good. You can change your outfit and every weapon. It doesn't have that RPG customization but the necessary things are there. You can change to alot of outfits and huge amount of different gears.

Quests
No more missions. Take quests and do them whenever you want. Seriously tho, they did a great job with the quests. Didn't feel like they were repetitive for a second. Side Quests are just too good. Excellent side quests everywhere. Really good story and interection. There's alot of side quests but some are easily better than some main quests. 120h and i still couldn't finish alot of side quests.

Characters
Bayek is one of my favorite protagonist in AC series. The characters in Origins are really well made. Interensting characters with good stories. Each main quest/side quest characters are interesting. Main Characters like Bayek and Aya are perfect. But ACO fails at delivering great Enemies. Some were interesting and you will remember them. But most of them.. i already forgot lol. Don't expect anything like Cesare or Haytham here. When i say you will forget those enemies, i mean their characters.

World Design
Oh my.. i'm in love!! The game world is huge! The entire Egypt and the way they portrayed Ancient Egypt is just magnificent. The citites, deserts, rivers, jungles and lietrally everything about the world is just too damn good. The world looks so alive with great NPC. NPC doing their own thing like harvesting crops and other vegetables, selling things, talking about things with each other, fishing and then going back to home at night. The world just moves on no matter what you do. It has life of it's own. Every part of the world is more than worth exploring thanks to lot of hidden caves and other things that you can find like that. Even underwater is so worth exploring. The animals doing their things, sleeping, resting or hunting. I can't describe how amazing the world is with words..

Graphics
Just beautiful. Before this my favorite graphical game was GR Wildlands but this beats that in every way you can imagine. From the biggest statues to smallest scorpion looks amazing. Ancient Egypt never looked any better. No other game world looks this good IMO. The facial graphics of Bayek to every NPC looks stunning. The beautiful cities, stunning jungles, beautiful water graphics above and underwater and the deserts. The visual in this game is so good that you will keep exploring and taking screenshots instead of playing. Just check some gameplays. Oh and in 4K this game looks "real life" but better.

SoundQuality/OST/VoiceActing
SoundQuality is really good.The weapon sounds, animal sounds to sandstorms and every other part of sound is really good.

OST Beautiful collection of OST. Sarah Schachner did a fantastic job with these ost. Just search some up and listen. And they also modified quite good amount of AC2 OST and put them here, including Ezio's Family.

VoiceActing is also really good. Bayek and other characters voice acting is on point. The NPC and each character has that accent.

Optimization
is really good with this one. Really strong PC port. I get over 90 fps AVG with GTX 1080Ti and I7 6700K Max settings 1080p. Fps dropped to 75-80 in some NPC crowded cities. I tested with GTX 970 and I7 6700K Max settings 1080p and the FPS was average 45. It did drop to 32 in NPC crowded citites. I also tested 4K with GTX 1080Ti and I7 6700k and at max settings i get average 53 FPS. Now i didn't face any bugs in this 120h. No bugs or glitches. After the recent updates i'm getting stable 60 most of the time at 4k with 1080ti. No more drops in cities.

Controls
Controller controls are really good. Just too good. Without any sprint button, you control speed with your analog sticks. Overall controls are fantastic.

KeyboardMouse controls are really good as well. But the controls could be awkward for old AC players. Also without having analog stick on PC, you can't control the speed like you can with controller. Which wasn't that good for me.
I Recommend Controller for ACO, Xbone/PS.

Overall - 9.6

I'm absolutely in love with ACO. Alot of the time the game feels more like completely differnet game rather than another AC. And that is a good thing. The game world and graphics are just stunning. The optimization is really good as well. The gameplay feels great as well. The combat is new and it feels great while stealth is harder but good. The story is really good with a fantastic ending. Overall i think everyones gunna like ACO. Either you're AC fan or new to the series. Overall this is easily the best AC game. The story isn't better than any of the Ezio game. Ezio trilogy is still my favorite but combine everything of ACO, it's nearly a masterpiece.

I love this Assassins Creed because it doesn't feel like every other Assassins Creed. Characters and setting are just so amazing in this title. The side quests you can do are also very enjoyable and doesn't feel AS copy paste as other titles in the series.

Great game even if you are new to the series. Honestly good buy at full price (we are all cheap, get it on sale)

Having spent enough time into this game I found it boring and repetitive. After reaching level 35 on my first play through, I quit and started fresh, assuming I did not play it right. That I missed a lot of side quests and exploration. I was wrong. This is a very shallow game.

The main quest is short, rushed and incoherent. Also, I do not like being forced to change characters when I have chosen and built one to my liking.

Side quests are horrendous... all similar, assassinate target, fetch item, free prisoner. Zero variety. Bayek is your local delivery boy. All tombs feel the same and so do all garrisons and forts. All that puzzle solving and footwork for meagre XP and useless loot. And of course you can spend a lot at the store if you are gullible enough.

I have not seen in my memory such a shallow game that touts such a large world. And when you do find yourself immersed in exploration, layla hassan wakes up and ruins your momentum, or you have to play as aya. What nonsense.

On a positive note, the world is beautiful. It's a shame they made such a bland game out of it. While important dialogue is in english, villagers and unimportant npcs speak a regional dialect which I do not understand... why? I wish I could eavesdrop on conversations and understand what the ordinary civilians are talking about. Small things like these is what made Dishonored a masterpiece. Also Cleopatra speaks in a British accent. Awesome.

Of the 100 plus hours I spent into this game, about 65% were spent travelling, 15% figuring out puzzles, 10% in cut scenes and another 10% in combat.

Combat system is not that bad as some mention. Overpower attack is terrible though. Bayek acts like a mentally unsound individual while using it. there is no way to direct it where you want to. One time he killed an unmounted horse while ignoring the real enemies around him (poor horse)... On other occasions he takes down the weakest enemy while I wanted to use it against the strongest.. or will simply attack a tree or a wall or an invisible target. It is a shame because that one attack is very important against high level enemies, and it takes a while to build up..

Overall a very ordinary game, Not recommended. I would rate this a 6 out of 10. Play it if you have nothing better to do. I do not understand how this game gets so highly rated here. It has a 6.7 USER rating on metacritic, which seems just about right. I don't trust CRITIC rating (8.4)

I've finished the original AC, AC2, AC2 Brotherhood and Revelations, I could not stand any AC game that came after those.

AC Origins broke that trend. The new fight system is very reminiscent of the Witcher and Dark Souls style, you have to think on your feet to dodge, block and parry, quite enjoyable.

The quests are interesting, there is still the usual fetch me this and find me that, but it doesn't bother me much.

The best part of the game I would say is the ancient tombs exploration and the whole feel of Ptolemaic Egypt, the Nile, crocodiles and hippos, all bring that wild feel to the game.

Yes, Bayek is a bit OP with his personal eagle drone, but I still find it very useful, so it doesn't bother me much.

As usual Ubisoft did an excellent job on graphics, design and aesthetics of the game. I heard of some performance issues but didn't experience anything unusual from a ubisoft game.

In conclusion, if you miss the old AC, this game is for you.

So far the game within its self is amazing.
Good voice acting, graphics and combat but there are some performance issues. For whatever reason this game is using 100 percent of both my CPU and GPU which it should not be doing. But besides the performance issues the game itself is a masterpiece.

Edit - Just beat the game for me the best assassins creed game out of the entire series.

If you look at the vastness of the world, you realize something...I am but a grain of sand, but I am part of it all.

To fix stutters and frame hitching switch priority in task manager to above normal and your game will run smooth as butter.

I didnt plan on keeping this game, because it has been getting somewhat mixed reviews and bad press based on the performance debacle. But never the less i wanted to check it out since i stopped playing assassins creed back when revelations came out.
I am now about 4 hours in and i am stunned. The game runs very smooth and i am palying it on a Gaming Laptop with an Nvidea GPU, this appears to make a big difference. The visuals are absolutely stunning and i havent felt that immersed in a game world for a long time. The world is absolutely beautifull.

For everyone who values immersion and feeling of a game highly i really recommond playing with the minimal UI option. The gameplay holds up very nicley too, it still is a little clunky here and there and i personally would enjoy a free targeting system much more, but it is a great time never the less.

The skills are varied and really add new gameplay possiblties.

If i could, i would return this game and pick up the gold version in my local store, because this is a game which, for me at least, has earned a spot in my collection and i would love to see it in my cubboard.

To everyone who is undecided yet. Try it out for crying out loud, you wont regret it.

Thanks Ubisoft for invigorating this series with such a great entry.

EDIT: Patch 1.03 brings improvements and changes my opinion of the game, but it still hits 100% CPU usage almost all the time so there's that.

I'm also changing the review to a recommend, the game is really good and I'll post a full review once I'm done with it. For now, outside of cities, the performance is silky smooth.

And yes, it still is ridiculous that there needs to be multiple layers of DRM to protect a game. Calling people pirates on the reviews portion of a game that I clearly bought kinda defeats your point.

But by all means, please continue.

It seems I was wrong about the CPU usage but since us 'gamer' types take a critical opinion of their favourite games as a personal attack, I'm elaborating upon this a bit.

I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up, I thought the bad performance was solely due to the high CPU usage. Patch 1.03 showed that it was not, so clearly I was wrong. Take this and stroke your ♥♥♥♥♥ with it.

That being said, about the game itself, I'm quite enjoying it now that FPS doesn't randomly drop all over the place. The rural areas of the game are running quite well on Ultra, whereas the cities still bring the framerate down, but only to 40-45 - a massive improvement over what it was pre-patch.

The gameplay is, for the first time in a very long time with this franchise, actually fun. Once you get the hang of it and find your favourite weapon (I highly recommend Battleaxes), combat is fun, risky and if you're playing on hard, challenging. Taking on multiple enemies at once can and sometimes will end badly for you, which encourages the use of stealth over an all out full frontal attack.

The graphics are amazing. I've been taking some really fantastic screenshots after I started playing it again post-patch. The lighting, especially in closed areas, is simply amazing, and with the use of photo mode, you can click some amazing pictures all over the place.

It's too early for me to talk about the story, because I've been doing my best to do everything else apart from the main quest. Bayek's personality is well explored in the many side quests he picks, and while it might not be as detailed or as consequential as the ones in The Witcher 3 (which people seem to be comparing it to), they are fun to do and not simplistic, dull collect-a-thons.

As of this moment, if you have a competent CPU cooler that does not push CPU temps over 80-90 degrees Celcius, I highly recommend you pick up this game, Assassin's Creed has return to the fold and it has returned triumphant.


OLD AND OUTDATED REVIEW DOWN BELOW:

I cannot, in good faith, approve of this game in its current state. The game seems well made but VMProtect's constant CPU hogging is putting my PC at risk. It is ridiculous that we need to go through Steam, Uplay, Denuvo and then VMProtect. It is taxing the CPU, with all cores being heavily taxed.

Fix this, Ubisoft, the game is pretty decent and PC gamers deserve better.

Played them all, loved them all, this one is by far the best. No boring/stallouts like the others. feels like a new game entirely. Love the setting/visuals and the story kept me interested. Worth trying out for sure.

Product refunded

100% BROKEN game (for me). No sound in cutscenes, the main characters friend at the start of the game transforms into a villager on his camel with year 1998 graphics, transforms back to normal, and when you arrive at your destination he gets off the camel, transforms into the villager again and starts walking THROUGH WALLS. (I have recorded video evidence of this, hmu if you want to see) This is the game breaking glitch. He then continues to walk for a few hundred meters through walls and under ground, then he transforms back to normal and just stands there. After a while he begins to vibrate hysterically, and the first quest doesn't end. Ever. This breaks the game because since the quest never ends, the next quest can't begin and that's the end of the story. I am so ****** disappointed. I saw so many good reviews, and even among the negative reviews nobody ever mentioned any glitches of this magnitude, and here I am; unable to play the game because it's completely broken. Refunding and MAYBE buying it on PS4 instead, but right now I'm so pissed I don't know if I wanna buy it at all.

EDIT: I tried restarting the game and I even deleted my entire save file and started from scratch. The same glitches happened again only a bit differently. But nevertheless I couldn't continue playing.

I don't really do many reviews, but I wanted to give my support for the game here with a thumbs up.
A massive open world to explore the depths of Egypt and its ancient history. 40+ hours in game time with all main quest completion and still didn't got bored playing it. Insanely beautiful Scenery, characters, animal,infractures,pyramids and everything is really extremely well done.The story is not very big but it will touch your heart beacause its soo deep and insanely well written.It also marks the begining of THE CREED The Brotherhood.huge open world map, millions of quests, tread one meter and you have another thing to do. A completionists dream or nightmare, whatever :) Overall i strongly recommend this game you will have dreams of it definately :P

One of the best from AC series! It's like watching a movie, I found it so interesting. The graphics are spectacular, specially the cut-scenes. The scenery of Egypt looks amazing. Unlike on other games I didn't feel like skipping dialogues. The story is great and captivating. Bayek is my favourite Protagonist of all the others from the series, he is a very relatable character. He displays both immense kindness and towering anger, deep sadness and boyish humour. He is incredibly gentle with children, loving to his hawk companion Senu. I found the game to be huge, with loads of side quests. Couldn't recommend it enough. 10/10

This game is amazing. I did not play much of previous Assassin games but this one fulfilled all my expectations and then some. Mechanics is superb, visuals breathtaking. After 14 hours playing I found myself more and more immersed in world of ancient Egypt. Recommend this game 100%.

The most fun ive had since the Witcher 3.

For those of you saying in the forums "I wont buy this game bcause x" , ♥♥♥♥ off nobody told you to.

Also theres a day and night difference between lootboxes in a game such as Shadow of War then Origins.
Lootboxes are gambling, however in Origins you know what your paying for.
Heka chests are only purchasable with IN-GAME currency.

i bought this game several years ago, before i could actually play it because my pc was so bad at the time. i got a new graphics card for christmas, and since then ive accumulated 28 hours on this game. i have adhd and hyperfixated on it immediately. the storyline is fun and interesting, and while some of the fighting mechanics are awkward theyre still enjoyable. i love standing on top of the pyramids even though climbing up them is a pain. the bosses are always a lot easier to kill than i think theyre gonna be. now if ull excuse me i have to speedrun the rest of this game so that i can play valhalla

I personally like the game but that's not the point. The point is that it's a damn fine game (with understandable flaws). published by Ubisoft That's right, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I don't believe it myself. So why am I writing this review with a "No" recommendation you might ask. Simple, so that those who have not even played the game and have blindly hated on it prior to its release can see this review using the "Negative Reviews" filter. If you wish to truly read an unbiased review, take the time to read this.

_______________________________________________________________________________
OFFICIAL REVIEW

I am 96 hours into the game, finished the entirety of it including the main storyline, sidequests, and all locations on hard mode. I've never actually been an AC fan (In fact I hated them for the most part), though I've played the previous games apart from rogue, unity, and syndicate and all I can honestly say is that the AC Formula prior to Origins is plain straight-out repetitive. Assassin's Creed and the concept known as "CONSISTENTLY FUN", never seemed to have coupled with one another. Until now however, with Origins. To site a few repetitive activites in the original formula:

FLAWS OF THE PREVIOUS AC GAMES
- Trailing missions (Follow this guy for 20-30 mins and if he sees you no matter how close you are to finishing the trailing mission, you get desync'ed)
-Side activities particularly assassination contracts with no substance (There is no compelling backstory to motivate the player. Sometimes, there's no story at all. LMAO)
- Long ass modern day sequences that break the immersion of being an assassin from a specific time period
- Beautiful recreation of historical landscapes though lacking the flavor it needs to captivate the player and by captivate I mean to truly be enticing and not just a mere one-time glance.
- Laughably unchallenging Combat System that only kept me interested for the first 10 mins of experiencing it. After that I realized two buttons only mattered in combat; Counter and Attack (= Counterattack).
- All in all, too linear which always kept the player on a short leash.

With those factors listed, I want to explain briefly how the revamped AC formula of Origins have addressed the past insipid experienceI had with the AC Series:

ADDRESSED FLAWS (OR PRO'S)
- (Bummer for AC fans, I know, but hear me out) No more social stealth BUT THAT MEANS NO MORE BORING-ASS TRAILING MISSIONS THAT ARE BASICALLY UGL's or (Unnecessary game lengtheners). No more blending in with the crowd because you're not trailing anyone anymore. Though it was useful in terms of escaping pursuing guards, I'll admit. But I'll accept that compromise any day so as to completely remove the ♥♥♥♥-faced trailing missions.

- Sidequests (that'rs right they're no longer called missions) now are actually story-driven which makes the experience a whole lot better. Gone are the days when I have to senselessly assassinate someone without even knowing why I had to do it.

- The modern day sequences (Yes there is a modern day story in Origins, not sure if that's spoiler-worthy tho) is actually quite decent tho not as decent as Desmond's I'll say but the point here is that it does not over stay its welcome unlike previous modern day stories, so yeah, immersion-breaking problems are addressed here.

- Not only is recreated ancient Egypt of AC Origins a landmark to behold, it's also alive and breathing. The AI system (tho clunky at times) have specific schedules each tailored to the grand fabric of a truly immersive Open World. Heck, even the animals hunt and eat corpses of guards that are thrown by fellow guards on duty in the river. It's so detailed you can even see the mummification process in Memphis. And of course, it's not just a one-time glance anymore, with the addition of Photo mode, this game has entered my personal list of top 5 Open Worlds.

- Now I know a lot of hatred for this game is due to the new combat system, but it feels and plays better than it looks. If anything, it's way better by a hundredfold than the previous combat system wherein a baby could basically master it in a few seconds. It takes time getting used to it but once you get the hang of it, it's altogether very rewarding.

- This game have finally given the player so much freedom that I'm happily an AC fan now who looks forward to future titles. Black flag did a great job at the Open Seas exploration tho it still lacked the necessary aspects in terms of the freedom from a true sandbox experience derived from an Open World game. I'm just glad AC is no longer linear, the series always had huge potential had it been an open world from the very beginning. Historical landscapes easily explorable anytime without the hindrance of loading screens is what makes this game a truly fine experience.

________________________________________________________________________________
(IF YOU ARE STILL READING THUS FAR, I APPRECIATE IT. BEAR WITH ME AS THIS WOULD ONLY TAKE A FEW POINTS LEFT)

For the last part of my review, let me quickly give you a rundown of the Cons that has really got riled me up to take a piss on this game:

CONS
- U-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-PLAY
- Microtransactions (But they are only ever there if you need them. You can get all of them by playing the game tho RNG-dependent that is)
- Annoying FPS drops when exploring cities attributable to the HIGH CPU USAGE (My gtx 1060 3gb drops from 70-80 fps to 40 fps or half of it @ 1080p High Settings)
- Horrendous facial animation during non-cutscene conversations.
- The story plot is not the best although it's interesting enough for players to engage in it. The way I see it, it could have been handled better in terms of story delivery. Where the main storyline falls short is during the later half of the progress. Character development at that point seems rushed and all of a sudden you feel like asking, "Who was this again?". However the ending did justice to the original storyline of the AC Series by simply going back to its roots. In addition to that, if you pay attention closely, the ending reveals a certain assassin whose sepulchre was visited by certain assassin named Ezio.

CONCLUSION
Please don't dismiss the game altogether all because the publisher have had a bad reputation for the past few years. Yes it's true that Assassin's Creed Origins is a long way from reaching the pinnacle of an almost perfect Open World Rpg game like The Witcher 3 though it's definitely on the right track which makes me excited for future titles of the Series. Hopefully, Ubisoft will continue with this formula with significant changes towards the weak aspects of the game so that it can acheive its full potential as a benchmark or golden standard for Open World RPG games in the future.


RECOMMENDED FOR
1.) TRUE AC FANS (NOT THE WHINY ONES WHO SEEM TO COMPLAIN ABOUT NEW INNOVATION) WHO LOVE THE NARRATION ASPECT OF THE WITCHER SERIES COUPLED WITH THE CHALLENGING COMBAT SYSTEM OF DARK SOULS.
2.) GAMERS WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE AC SERIES (This is a decent starting point).
3.) PEOPLE WHO HAVE PLAYED PREVIOUS AC TITLES THAT HATED THE AC FORMULA.
4.) CASUALS WHO LOVE OPEN WORLD EXPLORATION.
5.) PEOPLE WHO OBSSESS ABOUT HISTORICAL EGYPT.
6.) EGYPTIANS

Good day dear reader! I decided that after going through each game for 100%, I will now write reviews) Before I begin I will say this: If you liked the old AS series, then buy this without hesitation. Because this game is better than the rest in almost everything! And if you haven't played AS series before, then I can say that you can start playing from this part without fear. As I wrote earlier, this is part of the AS to surpass the old in almost everything. Graphics, physics, Gameplay, Skill system and inventory, improved and finalized. The plot became much more interesting (I immediately noticed that after the AS: the syndicate began to show more attention to the plot), the game now looks more like an RPG. Additional tasks also became more interesting (well, here, just like in other games, bring that, kill one. But now, at least they started to explain logically why it should be done), the Characters began to think better (Facial expressions, movements of hands, eyes, mouth and how they behave in general terms). And most importantly, all this intertwines with the story that doesn't cease to please me! Although there are a lot of mistakes and inconsistencies, but still where can you still learn so much about ancient Egypt? Undoubtedly this is the best historical game in our history. I haven't played games where so much history is implemented in such detail. They even brought an interactive tour of Egypt. This is very cool for educational purposes. You can immediately see how difficult it was to develop the game. I've long wanted to play and learn at the same time. And Ubisoft began to implement this! The only thing I didn’t like was the influence of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feminists. Bayek is more like a supporting character and henpecked than a defender. And Aya ... An idiot who thinks that makes the world a better place destroying it and interfering with all imposing her worldview, in short, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ feminist! Well what can I say they are everywhere now. May Apophis absorb the souls of feminists who prevent developers from making normal games. Yes, they will not fall into the fields of Ilau xD In general, I advise everyone to play this game and buy without any thought. This game is not only interesting but also informative for the purposes of history!

Доброго времени суток дорогой читатель! Я решил что после прохождения каждой игры на все 100% я теперь буду писать обзоры) Прежде чем начать скажу вот что: Если вам нравились старые КУ то покупайте эту без раздумий. Потому что это игра лучше остальных практически во всём! А если вы раньше не играли в серии игр КУ, то могу сказать что можете начинать играть с этой части не боясь. Как я писал ранее это часть КУ превосходить старые почти во всём. Графика, физика, Геймплей, Система навыков и инвентаризация, улучшили и доработали. Сюжет стал куда интереснее (Сразу обратил внимание что после КУ:Синдикат к сюжету начали проявлять больше внимание), игра теперь больше походит на РПГ. Доп.задания тоже стали интереснее (ну тут так же как и в других играх, принеси то убей того. Но теперь хотя-бы начали объяснять логично зачем надо это делать), Персонажей начали лучше продумывать (Мимика, движение рук, глаз, рта и как они себя ведут в общих чертах). И самое главное всё это переплетается с историей что не перестает меня радовать! Хотя тут очень много ляпов и несоответствий но всё таки где вы ещё можете узнать о древнем Египте столько? Несомненно это самая лучшая историческая игра по нашей истории. Я ещё не играл в игры где настолько история реализована так детально. Тут даже завезли интерактивный тур по Египту. Это очень круто в образовательных целях. Сразу видно насколько было трудно разрабатывать игру. Я давно хотел играть и одновременно обучатся. А Убисофт начали реализовывать это! Единственное что не понравилось это влияние сраных феминисток. Байек больше походит на персонажа второго плана и на подкаблучника чем на защитника. А Айя... Идиотка которая думает что делает мир лучше разрушая его и мешая всем навязывая свою мировоззрение, крч.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ феминистка! Ну что я могу сказать они сейчас везде. До поглотят души феминисток которые мешают разработчикам делать нормальные игры Апоп. Да не попадут они в поля Илау xD В целом всем советую поиграть в эту игру и покупать без раздумий. Это игра не только интересна но и познавательно в целях истории!

I have always been the biggest fan of assassins creed, having played through every one since inception. This edition however, for me, there was something lost. Yes, it's larger than it's predecessors, but the repetition was excruciating at times and the vast open spaces were less impressive and more featureless and dull. Missions were, kill this roman general, in an identical camp as the hundred past, rescue slaves, or find artefact. That was it. Time and time again. Such a shame, the magic has gone.

TL;DR: GOOD GAME, buy when on sale. 7/10

To preface this review, I have 100% completed the storyline and achievements for this game including DLC, and played over 150 hours.

The Good:
- Great action RPG gameplay
- DLC feels worth the money
- Great storylines among the Main game and the DLC's
- Many hours of content
- Actual variability between playstyles (especially early game), you can be an stealth assassin, an up-lose fighter, or a ranged bowman, and all are viable
- It "feels" like you're in ancient Egypt, if that's a seller for you
- The skill trees give you abilities that are actually useful, and make you want to really plan out your build
- The notorious Assassins creed trailing/following missions have been pretty much removed altogether in this instalment


The Bad:
- There a many missions that include investigations, which involve using searching around a room and interacting with anything out of the ordinary. Really boring, and sometimes even frustrating to find the "clues".
- A lot of the side missions are cut-and-paste, even in the DLC's
- The animus storyline is incomplete, we can infer what happens based off of the other assassin's creed games, but it straight up has no proper ending. The DLC's also missed the opportunity to expand on the animus storyline. Most people don't care that much, and just like the assassin stuff, but it's a little disappointing

The Ugly
- Visual bugs when you are swimming, hard to explain but you will 100% experience the "glowing" crack in the wall during your playthrough
- There is a bug that crashes the game and sometimes even turns my computer off. I've done extensive diagnostics and can 100% confirm that it's only happening with this game. The bug usually happens when you fire and arrow or use Senu while the game is auto saving. You will probably face this bug once every 60 hours of gameplay.
-Online connectivity is require for this single player game, which is a deal breaker for many of those with spotty internet.

Comments:
I liked the Hidden One's DLC better than the Curse of the Pharaohs. The Hidden One's is $10 less but much smaller. I preferred the storyline, and it felt more like an extension of the main game than the Curse of the Pharaohs. The Curse of the Pharaohs adds a huge amount of content, a ton of bosses to fight, and a ton of loot.

I give this game a 7/10, definitely worth a playthrough. At the time of writing this review, this game is almost 4 years old, so I wouldn't go rushing to pay the full price for this game. If you ever see this game for 35% off, or around $50, definitely pick it up along with the Hidden one's DLC, you won't regret it.

Assassin's Creed Origins took me whole 3 months to finish (100% of base game, both DLC's and Discovery tour, all achievements and club challenges) but it was definitely worth it! This game was one hell of a journey and I have to write a review of it (this one will be only base game review, DLC's will have its own reviews).

Story:
The main story quest line is not particularly long but it is interesting enough to keep you entertained. There are many cut scenes, everything is voice acted and there are several good plot twists that you won't be expecting.
There are little over hundred side quests and 24 main story quests. The side quests are pretty good too but after a while they will feel quite similar to each other. Some of them are unique but most are rather similar in content. But every quest is voice acted, they introduce some recurring characters you will meet later - either in base game or in DLC's.


Gameplay:
The world of Ancient Egypt is HUGE in this game and that's not an exageration. If you are completionist like me, you will be probably overwhelmed by sheer size of the map. The time it takes to explore everything is crazy. It took me around 150 hours to finish the base and most of it was spent on exploration. The world is stunningly beautiful. All the vistas, towns, cities, temples, deserts or countryside - all of them has its own charm and in this game, they feel alive with people or animals everywhere.

The tools you have in this game are numerous. You can run, swim, dive, ride a horse, camel, chariot or boat. You can climb every building or mountain or slide down the pyramids. You have your loyal Senu which allows you to see the world from bird's perspective.

The combat is pretty fun too with variety of weapon types. You can be a warrior and fight a melee or sniper with a predator bow, sniping down your enemies undetected or an assassin ambushing enemies from the shadows - the choice is yours to make.

Each weapon has its own atributes and abilities and there are several weapon rarities. You have an option to upgrade some of your gear which permanently increases tool or arrows capacity or increase your damage or health. The gear progression is suprisingly nice.

Character progression is simple but still rewarding. You will get ability poins for each level up and from certain locations which you can spend on enhancing your character and unlocking new combat options. Level cap is at 55 with all DLC's but you can still get experience even after that and keep enhancing your abilities.


Enjoyment:
I still found the game entertaining even after 200 hours. It was kinda hard to find a motivation to keep playing by the end of the base game but DLC's introduced some refreshing changes and the game become enjoyable once again. The issue I had with base game was simply that it was too huge and I was getting really tired of exploring all the regions. There were just too many of them and finishing everything just to get those achievements is very tedious.
Still, it was very enjoyable ride for most of the time and I feel like I will miss the Egypt now, that I'm done with the game.


Graphics:
If you can manage to play the game on ultra high settings @ 1440p then you are in for a treat. The game looks absolutely beautiful. While it is true that draw distance could be higher, or there could be an option to increase it for those, that can afford it, it still looks great. The view distance is insane. You can see all of the Egypt from some places and with the in-game photo mode, you can make some wallpaper materials.
If you pay close attention to the detail, you will notice that some textures has lower quality than other and sometimes, it is rather noticable but thanks to the great use of lightning the game looks just stunning most of the time.


Audio:
Everything is voice acted, even random NPC's are talking in Egyptian, Roman or Greek languages which adds to the whole atmosphere a lot. The voice acting is very good as well.
Sound effects are top-notch with great attention to the detail. The background music is subtle and not intrusive in any way.
Hard to find any flaws when it comes to audio.


Technicals:
The optimalization is not the best for CPU. As soon as you visit one of the large cities like Alexandria, Memphis or Thebes, your frames will most likely plummet. While I was able to have constant 60 FPS everywhere else, in those large cities, I was often down to 50 FPS and the game was stuttering a lot.
Other than that, I had few random crashes while playing and for the last couple of days, crash to the desktop when I tried to load my files. Not sure if this was Uplay issue or what was causing it.
But for the game as huge as this one, the technical aspect is very solid and the game is stable for most parts.

This game is honestly brilliant. If I was a professional reviewer I would give the game 9.5/10. The graphics are astonishing even though the game is massively CPU heavy and could be a problem for some players. The story line is very gripping and I love how in many quests they have implemented true ancient Egyptian beliefs, gods and things which were historically noted. Its great to immerse yourself in this setting. The combat is much more fun and gives more freedom with the skill trees than previous titles. AC 2 and brotherhood were my two favourites in the series and I believe this one has taken over as my favourite. Fantastic graphics, fun and clean combat, a huge map to explore many different regions, gripping quests which simply aren't 'GO and fetch me' type quests.

I've only played this game for about 6 hours. It's awesome, honestly. Funnest assassin's creed I've played.

Some people seem to think that I'm rating the game down because my computer's performance. If you read the whole review, that is not the problem. But for clarity, I am editing the review here to say that my specs are in the comments. My PC's performance is definitely not the issue here. I was running the game on Ultra settings with my FPS never dipping below 75, even in the most hectic situations.

The game has optimization issues, clearly. It doesn't run poorly on my system on Ultra settings, but it definitely doesn't run the way I'd expect it to. The gameplay is more than enough to make up for this. And I expect there will be a patch within the next month or two to rectify this.

Finally: the reason I don't recommend this. I can't start the game. I could start it a couple days ago, and that's when I played it for 6 hours in one day. Tried to start it the next day, and it didn't work. I've been chatting with the ubisoft support team since then with no resolution. This is the biggest issue on the Assassin's Creed: Origins support site that I can see with over 450 people engaging in the chat, saying that they have the same problem with no resolution, other than a few outliers who found success in changing the install location to their C Drive, running it in administrator mode, etc. But for the vast majority, this is a problem that has not been solved.

I can't give this game a thumbs up if I can't play it.

Edit: From what I've been able to troubleshoot with the support team and on my own, the failure to launch is most likely caused by A: Having more than one HD/SSD installed in the PC, B: A conflict between Steam and Uplay, or C: (Most Likely) Some weird combination of both. The only troubleshooting option the support team has left is to do a complete windows reset. I'll update when that happens.

Edit: Windows Reset didn't help either. Hopefully Ubisoft finds the issue and releases a patch to fix the issue soon, because at this point, it doesn't look like this is anything I can solve on my side. I'll update if the support team is able to help get the game running.

EDIT: FIXED! The most recent Uplay update fixed it for me! My guess is the Uplay launcher was having difficulty finding the game files for some reason or another, and that fixed it. Like I said at the first part of the review, I think this is a great game, and now I'm finally able to play it.

I sincerely appreciate that they tried something new, and took a bit of a risk, but for me this is too far of a step away from the previous titles in the franchise, to the point where it no longer feels like an Assassin's Creed game.

The leveling system feels too much like a classic RPG, and in increasing the difficulty of each area thus making it too treacherous and dangerous for lower level players to enter really takes away from the freedom that fans of the franchise enjoy.

Though my biggest issue with Assassin's Creed Origins is the rework of the combat system. It is PAINFULLY obvious that they tried to emulate Dark Souls. I cant help but feel like during one of the development meetings somebody said "You know what? People love Dark Souls, so lets make the combat system JUST LIKE DARK SOULS" and then everybody in the room cheered. Combat in the previous titles felt very fast and fluid, now it feels clunky and monotonous. *swing weapon* *dodge* *swing weapon again* rinse and repeat. I might have a personal bias, but I do not like Dark Souls, so having a combat system that feels just like Dark Souls does not work for me at all, and it makes combat feel repetative, clunky and slow. I also do not like how when you hit an enemy a number appears overhead to show how much damage/loss of health your attack did to the enemy. Again, it feels far too much like an RPG.

My final gripe is that they seem to have changed the movement (which seems to have been done to accomodate the combat system rework) there is no longer a sprint function, the character just runs at what feels like a pretty slow pace and the button usually associated with sprinting now causes the character to walk at a steady pace. This movement rework also makes climbing a bit more difficult and overall harder to manage. And I am sure we can all agree that the fast paced movement and climbing is one of the seminal components of the Assassin's Creed franchise.

I was really excited to play this game, and what I wanted and expected (and I dont think it was unfair of me to want or expect it) was an Assassin's Creed game set in Ancient Egypt, instead what I got was a game that seems to have abandoned it's predecessors and is trying really hard to be something it isnt and shouldnt be, whilst trying to emulate other games.

And as a quick side note, the game seems pretty poorly optimised, my system is not able to run it very well, and the frame rate is pretty low (but to be fair its not unplayable) in spite of the fact I have a GTX 1080, i7 7700k CPU with 32gb DDR4 RAM

Disappointed is an understatement, I have loved the franchise since the beginning but this game seems to have forgotten where it came from, and unfortunately due to this I doubt I will be checking out Odysee either.

Overview Specs: OC GTX 1080
20% OC i7 6700
I Spent US$ 67 For This Game In Australia Store Region, yes $67 for a Standard Edition
Reading PC Spec A recommend GPU and CPU to run this game smoothly is GTX 760 and i7 3rd gen
Meanwhile using a Freaking OC GTX 1080, i7 6700 can't maintain a smooth 60fps Ultra Experience With G-Sync, Framelimit Disable, a few places can reach to 90fps which is good but then 40-50fps kick in ruin the smoothness. Sorry with the high end graphic card I spent I expect a good experience
Just like Assassin's Creed Rouge, Surround Sound System not supported, No voice during cutscene, Framedrop in Cutscene as well, You must change your audio setting to Stereo, however an AAA game in 2017 that can't handle surround sound is not a good thing.
I'm a big fan of AC franchise and this game look promising so I decide to pre-order it, I have a PS4 Pro but 4k/30fps is not what I wanted, I want a smooth uncap FPS experience on PC
The game looks beautiful and the gameplay up till this point are very good, The Witcher 3 new Combat system feel so much satisfying, together with stealthy takedown just like old school AC
But this port need more improvement ( At least its better than AC Unity, I think I will try to refund this game and pick it up on Black Friday )
For now I can't leave recommended review because of the "not very well" optimized port
When I got the game again and all of this problem fixed I will change my Review
Thank you for reading my review, do not purchase this at this point yet as of 27/10/2017

This Game is insane!

🏆The best Assasin´s Creed Game in my Oponion.
The Graphic is the most beautiful ever since this time.

The Storytelling is very well, even discovering the hole areas of the big map, secrets in the desert and easter eggs (It´s worth it). (TheMapsize is maybe to big, but many of them is desert, so you must´nt go there in the Mainquest).

I didnt bought the DLC´s 🙊, but i can say that this AC is a Must-Play-Game. Never flashed of a game so long before.

Origins - good game, rpg now, different, Egypt, begining.
For the explorers. I like it more than Odyssey.
Wildlife, pyramids, desert, water, clouds, music, beautiful.
Mature story & quests, tour - is very interesting.
(Turn Off Ubi overlay in settings, if you have sudden fps drop)

Assassin’s Creed Origins is the latest in the cyberpunk-meets-history franchise of rogues stabbing tyrants in the streets and in their hideouts, all while being the first chronologically – taking place about 1000 years before the time of Altair Ibn-La'Ahad. Assassin’s Creed had been my favorite franchise because it offered me a way to play a certain character type/class and express as them mechanically and narratively that no other game managed to. Dishonored and Thief came close, which is why they’re other franchises I adore, but none truly hits that vibe I’m looking for the way Assassin’s Creed did… Until Unity and Syndicate.

There was something about Unity and Syndicate as compared to the previous games that seemed to lack life and vibrance, making it seem like the series was spinning its wheels and attempting to reproduce the magic of its first few outings while copy-pasting more and more and changing less and less. If people didn’t feel it with Unity – and some didn’t, citing it as one of their favorites – they definitely started feeling it with Syndicate. Both of them at their best were perfectly serviceable games about climbing buildings and stealth killing people, but no more. Ubisoft also felt a hit to their sales and success, so much so that they decided not to release an Assassin’s Creed entry in 2016, opting instead to put out a movie. And this, after earlier claiming in a press release, “We would be stupid not to release one every year,” the implication being it makes them too much money to consider stopping annualization. Wonder what happened there? ;]

Whatever the case, the consequences of how smashed Unity and Syndicate were by most of the fanbase and by the average casual player of these games were significant – they led to the creation of Assassin’s Creed Origins. And this game is now tied with Assassin’s Creed 1 (2007) as my favorite entry in this series I’ve stuck with for a decade.

The story is one that I enjoyed immensely, being one of the more “human” narratives I’ve experienced in the entire series, and all of the characters this time around are interesting to play as, look at or learn about. I couldn’t really say the same for some characters in previous AC titles, so this was something I genuinely wasn’t expecting. While the story is very obviously Bayek and Aya’s tale first and foremost, and the Assassin Brotherhood’s origin story second to that, there are certain revelations and implications that HEAVILY SET UP the upcoming Expansion “The Hidden Ones,” which is all about the Assassin Brotherhood. I would’ve liked to see more about the Assassins and their Creed, but what I got is enough to tide me over until that DLC hits.

Thankfully, this is the first AAA game I’ve played in a long time that actually made me *want* to buy DLC for it, that made me actually want to *play* DLC for it instead of skipping it over or reading a synopsis somewhere. I attribute that not just to the game’s narrative, but mostly to its new approach to game design and systemic interaction.

I once called AC Origins “The Dishonored of Assassin’s Creed Games” and while it definitely doesn’t quite reach that level, fans of immersive sims (whether 1st Person like Thief/Dishonored/Deus Ex, or 3rd Person like Metal Gear Solid V) will probably end up enjoying the crazy stuff you can do in this game by combining disparate mechanics together and seeing the logical outcome of that decision. Throw a sleep dart into a fire to create a gas cloud that knocks out everyone in the area. Nice, right? Okay, cool, but you can also throw down your own Torch and do it off of that. Because Fire triggers AoE effects on most of your Tools, this means you can be horribly sadistic and Firebomb one guard, then Poison Dart Cloud OFF OF HIS BURNING BODY to afflict all of his allies who’ll start coughing, spewing bile and taking damage over time. Maybe you miss fighting with the Hidden Blade, I sure as hell do. You can’t do it in this game but you can combine some Skills to make it a semi-possibility – Sleep Dart an enemy in combat, Assassinate him standing up and Chain Assassinate off of him onto one of his allies, preferably a Heavy or an Elite. Now you get two kills for the price of one. There are quite a few possibilities available that made me wonder “can I actually do this?” and answered me with, “Yes you can.”

After getting all of the Achievements and 99%ing the game (99% seems to be the highest Completion percentage available in-game, we’re not sure why or what we could be missing, maybe some future content) I was pleased to remember that because this is a “Live” game of sorts, Ashraf Ismail’s team will be supporting the game with post-launch content, a good deal of which will be Free for all players regardless of whether you popped down more Drachmas for DLC or Season Passes. The one that I’m excited to play next and which is coming soon, is the first Trial of the Gods, in which we’ll be fighting Anubis due to a glitch in the Animus. Patching in timed events during which you can challenge optional superbosses and endgame encounters like The God of the Dead and other deities is something that I don’t remember being a part of Assassin’s Creed – which meant that once you were done with an AC game, you really were done with it. This time, I feel like I’ll have something more to do every once in a while, which is good because for the first time since Black Flag I actually *want* to play *more* of it and I’m still not burnt out.

Once you get really deep into the groove, AC Origins can seem like a repetitious experience, but the methods you have available to you and the experimentation that’s possible makes that repetition less of a chore for me, and more of another opportunity to play around with the game’s systems, push myself to clear outposts faster and more efficiently, be more brutal, be more pacifistic, go loud and slaughter everyone or become an absolute phantom and leave no trace. Certain design decisions like having your Fist Takedown scale with your Hidden Blade damage while remaining Non-Lethal AND giving you all the XP you’d get from an Assassination lend the game a kind of “play your way” structure that feels really good. Your Main Targets have to die, of course, but other guards can be left alive if you so choose.

For those of you who enjoy Present Day and the Isu elements of the game like myself, they’re there, but most are optional as a courtesy for players who don’t want to mess with that stuff too much. While I would’ve loved Present Day’s gameplay to be longer and I wished there were more of a certain section in the late-game, I feel like this is a good start for Ubi to test the waters with more active Present Day experiences instead of having us watch totally passive cutscenes or walk around an office in first person and do nothing related to the series’ core gameplay of Sneak, Climb, Fight.

And for those of you who are not fans of that stuff (you should try it!), worry not – because there’s not a lot of it, and the beefiest parts you’ll never even have to touch as they’re not part of the main story.

I would recommend Assassin’s Creed Origins to fans of this franchise, and to the casual player – especially if you’ve been burned by Assassin’s Creed before and started wondering where this series lost its way. If you’ve been playing these games for ten years like me and you were ever heartbroken at how they seemed to care less and less about their player’s experience, Origins managed to heal that for me. I can’t guarantee it will do the same for you, because there’s a lot that’s different here, and you may have to get used to some new concepts. But if you do, and you really, really try?

I think you’ll realize that even a series on its last breaths can be revived. Everything is permitted, after all. ;]

The Witcher I never knew I wanted.

I have encountered a few glitches, at worst, an annoying sound glitch where my sound gets stuck on the heartbeat, and misses/stops dialogue with npc's as a result, but reloading the game fixed that. Egypt is stunning to explore, I wanted Egypt since Revelations. It's a really vast map with so much to do, even just running around using photo mode in cool areas is fun, but obviously there's way more to the game than that. I love the combat, it could be a bit less sluggish, and the AI could be a lot less dumb, but at this point I'd argue it gives the NPC's character and normally their level of dumb works in our favour, so it works. But the revamp of the combat system was completely worth it. Weapon variations are fun, upgrading them is worthwhile and so far I've ended up spending quite a lot of money on weapon upgrades as opposed to just letting it rack up in my inventory as I'd done in the previous games. The game itself is a really solid RPG, the side quests aren't grindy at all and most of them you either want to do the quest for the sake of the NPC or it has a good story line to it, that all lead you into exploring the map at the right pace, all I've done from the start of the game is progress because of this, as opposed to doing drab 'back and forth' quests that feel like you aren't progressing in the story/game at all. They really did take a leaf from Witcher, a little from Souls from the combat, and obviously kept it's own signature. I'd mebbe say wait til sale, but honestly, if you wanna play AC and want something fresh, this is the one.. It's a change of style but keeps the old school enough for you to get your AC cravings fulfilled. Uplay DRM sucks tho, my frames do drop and the game does sometimes stutter and fighting multiple opponents can be annoying. I also feel like they could've done more with the musice, good music makes memorable areas in my opinion, I still remember to this day the music in Brotherhood as I climbed the Colleseum, the music isn't bad, it's just a lot more subtle, but if that was what they were going for they got it, it's also just a matter of opinion. Lastly keep in mind the game has microtransactions, to the point you can unlock all the map secrets with £££, but to be fair, it's nothing a simple google search can't do anyway. Nothing is completely perfect though, maybe wait on some optimisation updates, but it's still one hell of an experience.

This game is really enjoyable. It is a massive open world and by far the largest AC world we have seen to date. The devs taking some time out from their usual one-year-pump-churn-repeat style that so many franchises are at fault of, it has really paid off. The game mechanics have had a complete overhaul, there are far less "collectibles" to get, the game is very story driven and focuses on exploration and of course killing and surprisngly, even though the game is basically desert based in terms of setting, you still get a vast variety of regions to explore containing rivers, lakes, swamps, forrests and of couse lots of desert and mountains. The views are amazing and the graphics are as good as any game out to date. The way you level up and what you need to do to level up with gear etc, it is VERY similar to Witcher 3. This game is a mix of Witcher, AC and Tomb Raider all into one is how I would describe it's feel.

However, something was missing from it. I think that when playing Assassin's Creed games, they are much better suited for huge city environments with incredible details. The game flows more as you have much more options. Black Flag could get away with having relatively small "city" or "town" details to explore as it focused a lot on the shipping side of things and sea. In this game, you don't get that option. The shipping side of things (which I find just as fun) are purely story driven only. So what we are left with is a massive open world game to explore, but not a huge amount of detail. The Witcher 3 or Ghost Recon Wildlands can get away with having vastness because the environments are so different and there is always something going on. In between the towns and cities (I don't think there is even a "city" in the game), there isn't a great deal to do aside from loot locations. I am fine with looting, just not having to travel 1000 miles to get from place to place with not much to do in between and very much the same stuff.

In a recent update it has added a first for the AC franchise and that is Tours. You can take guided tours of the entire games historic places, buildings and landmarks which is also backed up by running commentary on it's history and all things educational. Really good idea and there is no combat involved at all.

Overall this game is huge and is excellent. Worth the price. With the DLC, it is on par with Witcher 3 in terms of size!

P.S.I can't be the only person who thinks the main charcters voice (when he is wearing any kind of mask), it sounds exactly like Bain played by Tom Hardy out of Dark Knight!

Great looking game with some good gameplay. BUT poorly optimized by ubi random crashes every 20-30min and max cpu usage. And yes i meet the recomended system requirements. 15 hours of total gameplay with 10 of them being troubleshooting. I hope everyone has a better luck than me.... back to my witcher 3 then XD

It's a great game, despite lots of bugs and glitches. Moreover, the commands sometimes didn't respond in the way that I wanted them to and that's why I got frustrated a lot. All in all, it has a great story but it could have been done better. Just saying..

This is simply the best Assassin's Creed. Odyssey is a strong contender, but the mythology of old Egypt surpasses the Greek one. Also, a good mix of stealth and combat, whatever you chose to play, is very much allowed by speccing the right abilities letting you customize your own playstyle. Not as forcing as many other games of the Genre.

While the previous two games of this series (Unity and Syndicate) were innovative they still left me wanting for more. With Ubi taking an year off I hoped that the next game would be something amazing and this game is, to an extent pretty good.

As a die hard Assassin's Creed fan there were so many things in this game that I could relate back to the previous ones,
Decently sized but beautifully recreated cities, lots of open countryside fields and desert with secrets to explore.

I am glad that this time the main character Bayek was likeable and not just a stonefaced emotionless character that Conno Kenway was portrayed as. This kind of made the story more immersve to me.

Another change was the combat, Bayek does not feel like the one man army that previous characters were (for earlier levels) but after some progression you get used to it. My only problem is that they went back to the primitive target lock system from Assassin's Creed 1.

Overall, this was a refreshing addition to the series and I'm saddened to see that Ubisoft too, is stealthily introducing microtransactions into a singleplayer only game. (Real life money to buy crafting components, ability points, special locaitons etc. )

I'd say this game is a must buy for any Assassin's Creed fan and I hope Ubisoft gets better with time. Hopefully.

This game is simply amazing the story from beguining to end was engaging and quite long if you do the side quests instead of rushing the story

There is an item shop but i never felt like i needed to buy extra stuff to ''win the game easier'' and i finished the game with like 300 000 drahmas so i never felt like i needed to buy them and i hunted animals for the stuff i needed.

The Hidden Ones DLC was kinda dissapointing and short
BUT the Curse of the Pharaoh DLC was probably the best piece of DLC i've ever played it was long, there were plenty of areas to explore even secret ones. I Highly recommend buying it, The story was amazing also.

Overall the game with all the DLC is a 9.5 from me i loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game i even 100% the achievements cause i woudn't stop playing after the main story.

Highly Recommended

This is the reboot that Assassin's Creed needed in order to be an enjoyable game again, the 1 year break they took shows in the game being less buggy than the previous ones on release.

Gameplay wise, all the added RPG elements fits perfectly and adds a nice layer to all the gameplay elements from the previous AC games, i would even love to have more RPG elements but many of the casual players wont like that, so I understand why it's a bit simplistic when it's compared to an actual RPG.

The graphics are very nice and the locations are stunning, as usual based on actual locations but all the previous AC didnt look half as impressive as Origins, wherever you go on the whole map you can stop for a few minutes to take screenshot in what i think is the photo mode ever in a game and sharing the photos in game so your friends can see them while checking the map is an excellent idea.

Add to that the charismatic characters, decent main story & OK side quests and you end up with a very good game for AC fans and non fans.

An amazing setting, a stunning world and a good story combined, lead to an overall enjoyable experience.
The focus on RPG elements is more than welcome, and the new combat system requires some planning instead of simple button mashing.
Definitely recommended.

Beautiful world set in a truly interesting setting (ancient Egypt). It's a joy to get lost in exploring.
A TON of things to do. Side quests are (mostly) well-written, varied, and fun. The main story so far (I'm 30 hours into the game at the time of writing) is intriguing,
and I'm excited to see where it leads.

Best assasins creed game so far!

Assassin's Creed Origins was one of the most anticipated games of the year, well atleast it was for me. I was a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed Franchise up to Black Flag; for one reason or another I could not enjoy the titles that came after. This game however got me hooked after only a few hours of gameplay. When i first launched the game I intended to try it out for 3 hours... somehow that session took about 8 hours, this should give you an idea of how hooked i was and how addictive the game is.

Ubisoft seem to have improved a lot of the games interface and mechanics. The most noticeable is the introduction of the Action-RPG system, and they have done it right. There are levels, talent trees, rare drops, Critical hit chance, on-hit effects and much more RPG aspects that make grinding feel more rewarding and worthwhile. They introduced this RPG system while still managing to keep the game ... Well still keeping the game an "assassin's creed game" where stealth, exploration and recon are still important.

Other Positive notes on the game are:
-Amazing environment
-Very large and connective openworld (one that I can compare to the Witcher 3 if not larger)
-Unique and rewarding side quests
-A fun Combat system that is MUCH superior to the games predecessors. (fans of Dark souls, BloodBorne and Nioh like myself, will fall in love with it)
-Graphics are pretty amazing though requires a decent VGA
-Amazing Soundtrack (as we have come to expect from any Assassin's Creed game)

- Asus 1080ti
- 32Gb of RAM

At this current point i cannot reconmend this game, dont get me wrong i love the concept i love the egypt theme. But this game is that poorly optimized for pc. With 100% CPU and GPU usage constantly after the first 'tutorial' area. The first area of the game ran at 60% CPU and 100GPU which is fine i was happy with that. But as soon as you get to the town bang it throws everything at your CPU, the only application i have ever seen do this is AIDA 64 which is a stress test program.

I really dont know who tests this S*** at Ubisoft its really not that hard to say hey look the pc optimization is very bad. At this point i have requested a steam refund, if Ubisoft ever patches the game i may buy it again. Until then stay clear is all the advise i can give you. Unless you dont mind the thought of cooking your $400-$600 CPU.

First things first, this isn't your usual Ubisoft collectathon, and I have to applaud them for taking a step in the right direction. Recent Ubisoft games were filled with boring repetitive side-objectives and stuff to collect without any context. That gave games a little bit of extra padding and added length. But that doesn't mean there's not a lot to do here. There's still a ton of stuff to do here but it all feels meaningful, a little bit like the Witcher 3. Apart from that, ancient Egypt is really stunning and exploring this beautiful world is actually rewarding. Combat is the best in the series and leveling up, whatever the game, is always fun and addicting.

Overall, it's a great game, the developers were really passionate about making this, and the game reflects their passion and commitment.

In sum, i may be speaking heresy but i think Witcher 3 finally has been surpassed imo. I just cant get enough of this. The fight mechanic is the best i ever seen, i love how my sword cuts flesh and you can almost feel the body being stabbed/slashed.

And dont even get me started on the graphics... Ptolomaic Egypt is an eye-candy feast on my 1440p 144hz Gsync screen and my 1080ti just keeps smilling at it.

Assassin's Creed Origins is GOTY imo.

10/10

This is definitely an Assassin's Creed worth getting. The fighting style could be touched up a bit but the story is spot on and the scenery of Egypt is truly amazing. I get carried away from doing the missions and just take a small ride on my horse around the Pyramids. The optimization on the other hand isn't the best, that's if you have a powerful enough rig to run it and it is not recommended to be played on regular laptops or desktops that don't have an extra kick to running a big game. (My rig specs are on my profile) On the other hand, if you do have a gaming rig then you're all set to go. The stealth mechanic is impressive but AI tend to see you when you're not in clear sight which I believe needs to get looked into but ie: hiding in bushes works great!

One thing that I enjoy but dislike is this game has partial multiplayer, let me explain. No, you can't invite or join your friends in Origins but you are able to take screenshots in game and share them on the map meaning just about anyone can search on the map where you took your screenshot and see it for themselves. Another thing I really like is when someone dies in the game, you are able to see their death marker and avenge them by killing the enemy that killed them. This is very creative from Ubisoft but I would have preferred co-op or at least a free-roam only mode.

But other than that, definitely get this game if you're a fan of Assassin's Creed and stealthy games, when it comes to it. This is a must buy!

Speechless.

Due to the creed games previously, I was VERY skeptical about getting origins. After seeing some gameplay, and reviews I figured I would take a leap of faith ;) Lets dive in, shall we?

Gameplay

The game is set in Egypt near the end of the Ptolemaic period. The main character you play is named "Bayek". In my few hours of play, I was tasked with helping out a healer, blacksmith, and family in the first area named Siwa. 2 Hours of play later, and im nearing the completion of side and main quests for the area. Ive yet to even begin pursuing collectables! The game allows the player to play in ANY style they choose. Ranged attacks, fire bombs, bows, spears, swords of all types.. The diversity is intense in this game especially, as the open world of egypt is done incredibly well. You will literally feel like you are stepping back in the periods of what, 50 bc? You have MANY ways to complete a mission due to the vast amount of choices you have for say eliminating a captain. Want to climb on the roof and shoot him with the bow? Want to lure his guards to you, kill the guards, then have the captain investigate his troops, only to find theyve been inflicted with poison that will harm the captain himself. You also start off the game with a mount, and the ability to use him any time you desire. Crafting, although handy, is quite basic. Think Far Cry. Disappointed in that lack of depth, but it still allows for some game changing experiences. Just recently I met an old friend, senu? I believe. He is your pet eagle that allows for recon of areas, and tagging of enemies, objectives, and also you can set custom markers with him. Think Wildlands drone style.

Rating 9/10

Performance

Origins looks insanely beautiful on a modern day pc. Cutscenes look directly like the game itself does, and sometimes worse, as if some were ported from the console build. not affecting towards any gameplay, therefore I feel it shouldnt detract any score from the game. I did notice some little choppy/laggy bits in the beginning for some reason?

Now lets talk numbers here..

My PC is a i5 6600k Base clock, with a gtx1070 all run on a 140hz monitor

Ultra/max settings, the frames were at the lowest low 50s, max was around 70
High settings, Frames were a little better at 70-80 FPS
No need to test lower settings

Im not disappointed at the performance, as it is highly playable, but I guess im just SO used to getting frames that match my refresh rate..

Rating 9.5/10

Final Thoughts

The game is done incredibly well so far as im 2 hours into it, my biggest complaint would have to be the lack of a satisfying crafting system, and the very little frame drop from time to time. The gameplay affects are done really nicely, the UI is done really well.. Its a complete package that feels like a nice refresher to the more closed of creed games

Final Rating
9/10

I HIGHLY recommend this game if you new to the creed series as the combat is SO much smoother and seems more fluent. Look out souls, and witcher a new game is on the block ;) I Pray Ubi keeps building and improving upon this formula, and doesnt run it to the ground. Cheers folks :)

All hype ended when I climbed on those Pyramids and Sphynx..... Performance was great. Got 80-120fps on high settings. ICore I7 6700K, GTX970 4GB. 16GB Ram. Graphics 8/10. Controls 10/10. Fighting kinda tricky, needs practise. I really liked "building your character" like Far Cry games. Better than Unity, Syndicate. Oh yeah. Cities, deserts, mountains, they look really beautiful. So i will give 9/10.

It's actually my first Assassin's Creed series game I ever played. It's created by Ubisoft so most of the people should know that it has bug and it's grindy. However I recommend this game for players who like a game that is story rich and has a beautiful landscape. The map is really huge that takes hours to just running around and to discover all the places.

Most addicting game of the Assassin's creed Franchise I played this game continuously for days and enjoyed every small bit of this game. Best Assassin's Creed game since Ezio.

AC Origins set in time of historic Egypt is a great story rich game I dont wanna give any spoilers go and experience it yourself. If i have to define this game in one word then just simply EPIC!! DOPE !!.

I wanna start this off by saying I am huge fan of the AC series and I have played and beaten all of the Assassins creeds games, some of them multiple times. I was worried that they were changing up their bread and butter format for games but all of the changes added into origins make the game much more enjoyable and challenging.

Minimap and Eagle Vision:
In the other Ac games it was very easy to just pop out of cover for a second lure a guy over and then kill him it was generally very forgiveable to being seen by enemies which doesn't really make sense in a lot of situations. There was also a minimap which made it easy to rout all the enemies systematically because you knew where they were at with the minimap and eagle vision.

Assassins creed origins got rid of the minimap feature and replaced it with a typical skyrim and fallout type inidcator bar at the type showing nearby quests and areas. This makes the game much more interesting and challenging for a stealth game because you cannot see all the enemies on your minimap. They also changed eagle vision from a button that shows all enemies through walls and targets to an actual eagle lining up with AC lore. So you can scout out targets and mark enemies using your eagle which feels much more realistic and rewards calculated stealthy movement. They also added a leveling system to the combat making the game more challenging throughout and revitalizes the combat from the tradtional parry kill staleness AC is known for. In the other games I never worried too much about agroing 10 guards for most missions because I knew I could just parry and kill them all if I needed to but for origins you need to minimize the amount of enemies agroed to be successful in the game because of the huge revamp of the combat system in this game.

Combat:
The different melee and bow combat is very rewarding and very fun to use and rewards good mechanics and gameplay. I had always preferred melee weapons in the other AC games other than occassionally using my pistols to instakill enemies in tough spots. but in origins I find myself constantly using the bow to headshot isolated enemies and targets. The different types of bows are very fun to experiment with. The horse combat is very intuitive and realistic and can be very fun to hunt and fight from horseback in the right situation

Map and Exploring:
One of my favorite parts of the Assassin's creed game is the environment and historical world created by ubisoft to take you back in time and explore the cities and culture of that time. AC Origins and egypt is by far the biggest map and area to explore in the entire series and doesn't suffer from some of the reused textures and staleness some of the previous games had with reusing houses, character models, voice lines, and using pointless collectibles to fill the map. All of the map I have explored so far has been fresh, interesting and beatutiful constantly pushing me to explore more. The mounts have differing speeds and uses. The horses are fasters and better for combat and the camels are better for exploring and climbing rougher terrain. There is an amazing follow the road feature where the mount follows the road to your next objective or marker on the map making travel much more enjoyable and fun. While the horse is going to your next objective you can use the "eagle vision" to scout the area ahead and look for loot and mark enemies and targets while your horse brings you to the marker.

Story:
No spoilers but the story is very compelling and sticks to normal AC norms of making you truly feel a part of the character and constantly keeps you on your toes.

TLDR: No minimap, different eagle vision, revitalized combat, amazing map and travel features, stop reading this go buy the game and explore ancient egypt.
Remember:
Nothing is true.
Everything is permitted.

A brilliant step in the right direction.

Background:
I’m a long-time observer, recent lover of the AC series. I’ve played through AC II to completion (2 months ago) and it stands above the rest (I quite liked Brotherhood and Revelations too). I loved Black Flag but found it to be an excellent pirate game and just an ok AC game. Lastly, I’ve put many hours into The Witcher III and consider it the bar to which other RPGs should be measured. I will be drawing comparisons to both AC II and The Witcher III in this review. I’m a looter completionist who does not pay to win. I did, however, buy the deluxe version and so I have some badass gear out of the gate.

System specs:
i5 4670k 3.4 GHz, 8 GB ram, GTX 970 4GB, Xbone controller. I’m playing through on Hard mode.

Review:
Holy wow is this game gorgeous. I literally find myself trying to setup beautiful shots almost as much as I’m pursuing quests and lookout points. Settings are nearly cranked and I’m above 45 FPS at all times. The only glitch I've had thus far is the game getting stuck trying to transition from the first area (got hung at the "hyroglyphics load screen"). Now, while it’s easy to get caught up the beauty of it all, what about everything that’s behind that?

If you haven’t played AC in a while you’re going to have mixed feelings here. The developer is trying to hold onto what they tasted with AC II (brilliant story propelling fun gameplay) and replace aging in-game systems with improvements (many seemingly borrowed from other games). This is good news to me, but there are going to be some growing pains here.

The story is great but the delivery is just ok. I like Bayek quite a bit but I’m early in the game and don’t quite have him figured out yet. I knew who Ezio (AC II) was immediately, and he just kept growing on me. I didn’t quite know who Geralt (Witcher III) was but the allure of the brilliant story was perfectly delivered. In Origins the story sometimes feels out of order. I kill someone before fully understanding why I have such a rage-fueled desire to do so. Thus, instead of feeing pulled into the game I feel plunked in. It looks and feels so freaking good once I’m there I nearly forget, but it can be disorienting at times.

The movement within the environment has been perfected. I feel powerful, I’m no longer concerned about falling to my death accidentally, and transitioning from waking to running, to parkour is wonderful. When you realize you can call your horse while running and then jump on your horse in motion you’ll know what I mean. One button-press looting is a godsend when compared to holding a button for an hour in games of yore.

Stealth is similar, and the “sneak” toggle is back, but long-time fans will immediately notice the lack of ability to blend with crowds.

As this is the origin story, you don’t start with a hidden blade and don’t get one for quite a while. This makes you feel less powerful but I’m actually ok with that. Growing into greatness can be a very rewarding game mechanic.

“Eagle vision” (from games past) has sort of been split into two acceptable variants. You have Animus pulse (a name I loathe because you have it in this game before you have backstory for why it is called that), which lets you become aware of loot and hidden doorways in your immediate vicinity. It works. Then you have Senu, who is a carbon copy of the drone from Wildlands, except with unexplained x-ray vision. This also works fine, and feels at home in an open-world game like this. Long-time AC fans may feel like they are no longer able to charge in, hide, locate all enemies instantly, and then charge forth and stab...and that’s true. I really like Senu, and the concept, but I also have to let go of my AC II-based expectations and remind myself that Origins is going to force me to take my time.

Combat is a whole new ball game. I’ve always had mixed feelings about AC combat - god was it rewarding to know that I could take 20 guys and all I had to do was press one button to block and then watch the bloodbath ensue. On the other hand, it quickly felt skill-less and left me wanting a deeper combat experience. Well, Origins goes deeper, and its hard to judge because my nostalgia has created false expectations. What do you mean I have to be thoughtful about my approach and then take time, in the moment, to space myself from enemies?? I truly think I’ll appreciate it more and more as time goes on. Meantime, the animations are fantastic and the payoff is gruesome and worth it.

Oh, also archery is here in full force - which I've managed not to experience in the other AC games I’ve played. Horizon: Zero Dawn set the bar (for me) for brilliant archery combat, and Origins does a very decent job. You can kill stuff from horseback, you can line up headshots stealthily, you can light arrows on fire and carefully cause a death bonfire - love it. There are quick-fire and “shotgun” bows that feel as realistic as they can, if you can get past them basically being re-skinned guns. No required use so you can play your own way if you don't like em.

Skill trees are a thing now! I love the idea of skill trees but I have yet to find one I love. The Wither III came damn close, and Horizon: Zero Dawn did a pretty nice job. Ubisoft has done a decent job here - my one gripe is that I feel like I’m being lead to choices instead of making them of my own free will. I’m ok being gated by time (level) or cost of skill points, but if I have to choose skill A to get to skill B and then finally skill C I hate that. What if I don’t want the day/night cycle thing (yet)? Oh I have to get that to unlock the next set of totally-unrelated skills? Boo. That being said, almost all of the skills here have meaning and so I can get over the slight miss on delivery as the payoff feels worthwhile overall.

Ubisoft has gotten very good at streamlining. I feel like I can pick up any of their last few games, play for a few hours, gain some reasonable satisfaction, and put them down again. If one were to compare the delivery here to that of The Witcher III I believe they would agree that the overpowering need to invest in TW3 is far greater than any AC game. All of this is to say the systems in Origins are mostly refined, which may leave some feeling like they are shallow. You aren’t going to go on a cross-continental search for blueprints, grind endlessly for materials, and then finally craft a piece of gear. You will collect materials, and you will make meaningful upgrades, but things have been simplified here. That’s ok by me.

What else is ok by me is that you can upgrade weapons if you wish to keep them with you on your entire journey! Simple but so important to a guy like me. The gate is cost, and I’m ok with that - if I have to save diligently so I can upgrade my legendary lvl 1 sword to level 8 it feels worth it. Then I'm not ditching my lvl 1 legendary for a level 6 rare and feeling bad about it. It makes dismantling weapons for parts an easy decision too. Yes, this also means some players can pay to upgrade, but I say let em.

I'm not even close to uncovering the full story yet, so keep that in mind, but if you're an old AC fan, note my comments above and I still say this game will be worth your while. If you're not an AC fan, there's a lot of beauty to behold here, and the delivery has been carefully constructed, even if it misses the mark occasionally.

Just completed the main story and I'm still going to be playing more of this game. I have played many other AC titles and when I started playing this one I wasn't too sure if I would like it. I personally didn't like the levelling system at the beginning of the game. But over the course of the game I realized it was needed as it made you engage in side quests and exploring the map. Once you get the hang of the new combat system it is easy to master and you can even take down higher levelled opponents. The graphics of this game are amazing and the story is also very engaging. It still amazes me that every corner and every rock on this map was made by a human and the amount of time it would of taken to make it look as perfect as it does now. I also loved how the further you went into the story the less you would see of egyptian culture and more roman/greek culture.

Conclusion: Buy only if you enjoy great visuals and have a lot of time to spare since it has a leveling system integrated which forces you more or less to play more side-quests just to get up to level to help you finish the story.

Story: Garbage.
Visuals: Stunning.
Music: Acceptable.

I liked how the the 'AC story began', in ancient egypt and such.. But i actually wasted 30 hours of my life just to find some seeds.

Also, the CPU usage it's over the charts, i barely used the GPU.. I think it's because of the DRM or something.

How can i be an assasin if i need to be like the same level of the victim? What's the purpose of ASSASIN or Hidden Blade? I barely killed anything stealthy, the game do not allow it.


Anyhow, finished the story, uninstalled the game. Move on.

The last Assassin’s Creed I played was AC IV Black Flag. After that Ubisoft try some changes but wasn’t a real success (in my mind), so I left AC for a while. And Origin came up and everyone told this is the beginning of a new era for AC. It will look more like The Witcher. In fact, this is the end of you against a hundred of enemies without been touch. You have to think smarter. I really like those changes, it make the game more interesting, better and harder. And you’ve got a very good story to guide your game. Can’t wait to do the next one!

After playing this game i would say it could have been a bit better, it runs decent as the port isn't that good, the game world looks stunning with great looking textures, the world is packed with peoples, animals, collectibles, etc.

Bayek controls surprisingly good with very easy prompts, i would say it's really well done. Stealth is a bit tricky but with practice it will get easier as their are lots of areas to hide & lots of tricks in Bayek's sleeve. Combat is fluent & easy to master but some skills are required to improve the combat ability more, eagle vision replaced by Senu the eagle drone is job well done, it's controls are easy to understand & improvise in tough situations. It has different mounts like Camel & Horse which can follow the road on will allowing Senu to survey the world which is a unique.

Conclusion: The players who are die hard AC series fan they should definately get this. My score 7/10

*Optimization needs improvement*

This is an update after having spent around 70 hrs in game. As I had stated in my original first impressions review, the game is very similar to The Witcher 3. A LOT similar actually. The only thing different is the lack of fantasy material (monsters, magic) and the setting. So to make things easy, if you liked TW3, you will like this one too.

Things I liked:
+Skills. On this scale is a new treat for the AC franchise (Syndicate had some too but not on this scale), and makes the game more detailed.

+Setting. Beautifully crafted ancient Egypt. I love that era of Egypt, so blended with AC makes it a huge plus.

+Underwater. Finally it's here and it works well (unlike the jaggy controls of Black Flag).

+Open world. It is vast and I mean VAST!

Things I didn't like:
-Combat: Too linear.

-Equipment. Too similar to one another and the huge variety makes it tiresome.

-Microtransactions. Why do they even bother putting those in?!? Why the hell do I have to pay 60 EUR for a game and then pay extra to get the fancy equipment with Helix points. Enough is enough. The game does well without these.

If I remember anything else I will update.

Of course I recommend the game as I'm a huge fan of the series since the very first.

I'm getting 37 frames per second on average with 65% CPU usage on very high graphics settings.

Specs:
GTX 1050 TI.
i5-4570 @ 3.2GHz
8GB DDR3 RAM.
Installed on SSD.

I don't know if they fixed something, but I'm not having any issues playing so far. I'll update my review, but otherwise, the game is gorgeous and immersive. I only had to sign into uPlay once on startup and it was quick to start up and get me right into the game.

Don't heed everyone's criticism on Ubisoft. Some may be accurate and not at fault for their performance issues, but others might be getting the wrong impression just because it's Ubisoft DRM (which has a justified bad reputation, I know).

EDIT:
After playing for a few more hours, I've still found there to be little to no performance bottlenecks, even in larger fights. There may be a jitter here and there but that's to be expected when running a budget GPU. Pressing F1 should show you the performance profiler if you want to assert the issue more in-depth.

I'm not really sold on this game.

The world is amazing, a lot to explore and do. I always want to give it another try just for that.

But my biggest problem with is the combat, stealth and leveling mechanic.
I have played every AC title that ever got released for PC (except for Unity) and must say, I miss a lot in this sequel.
Stealth is almost non-existant. Often I was hoping to be able to simply drop down on an enemy or take him into a mount of hay. But no, the leveling mechanic makes it so, that you can't assassinate everyone. This gets especially annoying, when non-lethal kills stand in bottle necks you HAVE to pass trough to get to the objective.
Once you are in combat, you can't use your hidden blade anymore. You can't surprise an enemy when some ♥♥♥♥ 500 meters away spotted you, even though the other one has not seen you yet.
You can't drop down on a target when you are infight, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

The leveling seems pointless for the most part, since most of the skills are just "loot during a kill", "get XP when you smash somebodies skull in with ability X" or "Do 2% more damage with meele".

Combat is clunky at best, I was often unable to dodge a blow even though I was out of its range. Combat against 2+ enemies is a pain in the ass and don't get me started on elite enemies. They're not a though fight, they're just annoying. They break an attack or defense with a single kick and I have no chance to recover.


Maybe I'll drag this one trough, just for the world's sake, but I'm starting to doubt it.

One week passed and i cant even play this game. Pre-ordered it like an idiot. Outside of towns i get 90% cpu usage, inside towns steady 100% cpu usage which causes audio glitches, freezes and fps drops. Wolfenstein 2 came out the same day, it is using only 30% cpu usage MAX! I'm using i7 6700K @4,5GHZ and GTX 1080. ♥♥♥♥ UBISOFT WITH THIS KIND OF ♥♥♥♥!
Don't buy this until they fix this ♥♥♥♥.

Well, the gameplay concept has been ported from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt . Specially the mount, gear, quest system. But I am disappointed in NPC texture. Otherwise its worth a shot. Go for it!

Unlike other ubi games, this one is good to try. You will get what you paid for. There are a lot of side quest besides main story as well as some time limt games with leaderboard. Although I think the price of season pass is quite high. . .

বেশ ভালো অন্যান্য ubi গেমের চেয়ে। দাম উসুল হয়ে যাবে আশা করি। Photo mode আমার কাছে সবচেয়ে আকর্ষনীয় সংযোজন মনে হয়েছে। Quests ও অনেক রয়েছে মূল গল্পের পাশাপাশি। আরো আছে অন্তর্ভুক্ত ছোট সময় নির্ভর গেম যেমন, এরেনা। তবে season pass এর মুল্য একটু বেশিই হয়ে গিয়েছে।

Easily the best of the AC RPG trilogy, everything feels like it belongs (except the final fantasy stuff) and the gameplay is great. Story is focused on Assassins again for once. We havent had that in a while before or since.

This is the First Assassin's Creed since the Ezio Trilogy that truly blew me away.
The world is large and filled with interesting side activities that, for the first time in any AC game that i played, MEAN SOMETHING! They're not just there to fill out the map.
Also, the game looks absolutely fantastic. From the badass outfits to the Pyramids of Giza i haven't found a single thing that i didn't want to look at.
The story starts out a bit slow but gets better and better all the way to the kicker ending.

other pros:
-a skill tree and RPG-like progression system
-absolutely great combat system, far better than any other AC game. You actually have to work for your parry kills for once
-the game rewards exploring, which is great because there's a million things hidden in this game.
-no limits. the world is yours to explore in its full extent from the moment you finish the mandatory intro quest
-you get pulled away from the main quest line a lot , and getting side tracked is not boring at all.
-no BS stipulations for maximum synchronization. In fact, no stipulations on anything. you are truly free to tackle every challenge as you like.
-diverse choice of weaponry
-diverse boss encounters.
-YOU CAN FIGHT BLOODY WAR ELEPHANTS
-game runs smooth. although i read there can be some performance issues, i had none.
-The Bath towel outfit. nothing funnier than slaughtering some Romans in a towel.
-Those Who Came Before give you a lot of food for thought. If you are willing to listen.
-The game's built in Screenshot feature let's you take and look at breathtaking and hilarious pictures from the whole community. Yup this game has its own Instagram. sort of.

some cons:
-farming your upgrade materials can be a bit time consuming
-occasional small bugs here and there, but definitely nothing major or game breaking.
-even though some bosses can be quite the challenge, overall the game is a bit too easy for my taste. I'd like a difficulty setting higher than "hard"
-the AI can be a bit derpy if you have to follow someone or they follow you. Minor annoyance.
-microtransactions. well, it's Ubisoft, what do you expect. but throwing more money at them certainly doesn't give you acess to easy mode.
-Main character tends to have the vegan syndrome. He tells literally everyone who he is and what he does in the first sentence after they met.


Overall verdict:
definitely worth the 60 bucks i spent on this game. i clocked in almost 46 hours now and I'm far from done with this game. Exploring Ancient Egypt at the turning point of human history has been the best gaming experience i had in a while.

Well this game is a Witcher 3 wannabe covered on the veneer of the name of Assassin's Creed franchise . It feels very disappointing when you found your favorite game lost its identity an to become something that it isn't . So lets get to pros and cons of the game .

Pros :

1) Huge breathtaking open world . There is no such gaame available yet where the beautiful and mysterious world of Egypt is such meticulously realized and developed . No single location looks the same and the details invested creating the open world are astoundingly stunning .

2) A plethora of content . There are a lot of things to do do and explore where you can spend around 150 - 200 hours depending on your playstyle .

3) Exploration is engaging , intuitive and interesting .

4) Dynamic wildlife makes the world more realistic .

5) Discovery tour . Feels the a archaeological field trip which gives player a lot of insights about history of Egypt .

Cons ;

1) Dumb AI .

2) Bland Combat system

3) Few cutscenes to fleshout the story

4) Boring mission design . No branching paths , no decision system .

5) Niche roster of characters and NPCS to care about .

6) The main character does not have an engaging backstory and impressive personality .

7) Storyline is kinda boring .

8) Does not feel like an assassin creed game .

So , with its fair share of problems , I still enjoyed the game due to its well realized world of Egypt and tonns of content .

08 / 10 from me .

My score 9.5 / 10

game is addictive once you're hooked you cant stop playing, i've played all the AC games the one i liked the most was AC II but i can say this rank right on top of my list.

Such a detailed enviroment, biggest open world with the game size of just 33 gb
pc optimization is avarage, however if you have a decent rig you can play the game with over 60 fps on max settings without any lags.... storyline is vast and detailed. Soundtracks gives you the right feel .. game is enriched with side quests and missions.....

First off, my only complaint about this game is the combat. In my opinion, the combat from the previous games is better and a lot more satisfying. However, if you prefer a challenge or having more realistic combat, you will enjoy the game without problem.

Now aside from that, Assassin's Creed Origins packs an extremely beautiful and immersive world. I spent arguably too much time taking photos and just admiring the scenery in this game. The scale of the game is massive and the environment is incredibly alluring. Within this massive world there are plenty of objectives for you to do. The game has excellent missions and side quests. Side quests now have more dialogue and back story compared to the previous games, making it a more engaging experience. The game now even comes with a tour mode, turning the entire map into a virtual museum. Tour mode provides you many facts and details from real historians about Egypt and its numerous locations. If you have an interest in history or just love beautiful aesthetics and architecture, this game is a must have.

I really want this to be a good review, but I can't leave one. On the surface this is a fantastic game, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is one of the worst optimized games I've ever seen. I have a 1080ti, i7-8700k @ 5.0GHz and 32GB DDR5 3000mhz Ram, but this somehow isn't enough for this piss poor excuse for a port. Even the most difficult to run games run at 4k Ultra @ 60fps or 1440p Ultra @ 120fps no issue on this rig, but not Assassin's Creed Origins oh no. I tried every setting and it maintained the exact same frame rate even turned all the way down which shows there's some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimization in the engine itself. I've seen people even complaining about similar rigs not running 1080p @60fps which is ridiculous. There is no way they tested this ♥♥♥♥.

I first played this on PS4 a couple years back, and I enjoyed it so much that I just had to play it again on PC, this time with the DLCs. When it was announced, I remember how nervous I was with the new Witcher-style RPG changes, but I remained an open mind. Once I started playing, it honestly felt so right. It was the thing that Ubisoft needed to reinvent the franchise. Bayek's voice acting was done so well where I actually sympathized with his goal. It kept me engaged in the story well enough to anticipate the story's conclusion. Whether you're an AC veteran or if you've never played any of the games before, this is a must.

A true example of Irony!

Assassin's Creed Origins charm is the fact that it doesn't feel like an Assassin's Creed game.
What does it feel and play like? Like a poor man's Witcher 3. An overpriced version of the better game.
Assassin's Creed Origins costs twice as much as The Witcher 3. However when it comes to content and the quality of content then Witcher 3 feels like a triple A title while AC: O feels like a cheap indie title. The sad or a funny part is that it's the complete opposite: The cheaper and better game, The Witcher 3, is an indie game and the more expensive but way worse game, AC: O, is a triple A product.
AC: O is a very good game. However, let us admit that it tries to be Witcher 3 and let it be clear that Witcher 3 is superior in every single aspect.
That said let's get on with the review.

The Story

AC:O has a pretty basic and unoriginal story. It's what I call a "stock story". It's your classic man-on-a-revenge-quest story.
Either the protagonist has lost his wife, girlfriend, kid or an entire family because of the bad guys. In this case it's his son.
You play as Bayek of Siwa. A man who has lost his child. You start to pursue the evil doers and assassinate them one by one. That's pretty much the entire story without couple of spoilers.
You will travel through Egypt to Greece and Rome and then back again. The world is huge and you'll encounter a lot of characters and side quests along the way.

Gameplay

It's pretty basic and some would call it clunky but it does it's job and it does it's job well.
You can equipt different weapons: Shields, swords, dual swords, spiers, axes, maces etc. Each weapon has different attributes but they all work the same: RB - fast attack, RT - slow attack, LB - block. Yes, I used the Xbox 360 controller.
Movement works as you expect in an AC game. You run up a wall and your character starts to climb it. You can leap into haystacks and sneak around your enemies.
You also have 3 different skilltrees: Archery, Melee and Gadgets. That's not what the skilltrees are actually called but I figure these names make more sense. In archery you can upgrade your archery skill (obviously). You can equip 2 different bows, fire more than one arrow at once and even guide your arrows. With melee tree you can execute people faster and the gadget tree unlocks smoke bombs and lets you tame wild animals.

The world is HUGE and there's a lot to explore. You can buy different mounts (camels, horses etc) or fast travel between regions. You can do side quests, treasure hunt, take part in the gladiator tournaments or race in the hippodrome. At first it seems like the game has a lot going for it but in the end you'll realise that it isn't that much different from the other Ubisoft titles and each side quest starts to become a chore rather than a joy. It's definitely better than your average Ubisoft game but that isn't saying much.

Performance

Ubisoft games are infamous for being badly optimised. However AC: O seems to run fine for most of the people. I only encountered couple of graphical glitches myself and just a single bug in one of the side quests.
Graphically the game looks good. However I was a tad dissapointed. At max settings it doesn't look much better than The Witcher 3. The scenery is nice and will fool you but the graphics aren't anything special. I'd Say that Final Fantasy XV on PC looks way better.
Oh and when it comes to voice acting then this game falls into indie category easily. There's only a handful of characters that are voice acted well. Most characters feel emotionless and just fake.
These are my two cents.
I don't usually give out scores but some people are interested in them so...I'd say AC: O is a solid 7/10 for sure...That is if you can get it on a sale because it definitely isn't worth the full price for main game + expansion DLCs.

After AC Syndicate, this title is when Ubisoft decided that Assassins Creed needed to become bloodier.
This game also focuses on the beginnings of the Assassins Creed in history; therefore the title "Origins".

They also realized that they needed to change their easy counter-based combat system to a hitbox souls-like approach.
And it works well.
Game has the redundancy we are used to and the combat feels a bit repetitive after having played the more diverse AC Odyssey.
Cool screenshot posting feature on map.

Story is well written and focuses on loss, a romance, the pursuit of vengeance and whether that may fill the void one feels.
The Cast of Aya, Bayek, Cleopatra and all Egyptian mythology and culture integrated in the game are great.
The game even features a museum-like discovery mode.

For those of you who also dislike the grind as much as me; the game has a "Hack Animus" feature which was abolished in Odyssey.

Great game with an amazing story. The RPG elements are new to me but it's easy to get used to.

The second Ezio! Although it turns into RPG game, it still retain the assassin quality. Still have repetitive side quests but this time you'll feel different. Each side quests has it own story that make your playing process feels like you are immersed in the lifestyle, everything around of their people. Cuz of RPG game so you have to do the side quest parallel to the main quest. I did the side quest first and main quest last so when i touch the boss, he's died already. The map is still empty in some place but when you are in city you'll see the city is very busy and crowed. Each people has their own job, i once watched a woman make pottery for 30 minutes. Even the process of mummification of the Egyptians is described very meticulously and in detail in the game. The view is very beautiful to take a picture if you are a leisure gamer like traveling around. I've learned a lot about the Pharaoh and the process of forming the state apparatus at that time, their traditional, their Gods, also experienced after life of the Egyptians in virtual way.
If you like Egypt and like exploring the occult or simply the life of the people of that time, this game is suitable for you. Egypt feels scary sometimes, but it's gorgeous and beautiful in a way.

Now that I have beaten the game I feel as if I can make a review on it.
If you haven't played Odyssey then this game is going to feel very different to its predecessors. Assassins Creed 4 and Unity are very different animals from this game. I played Assassins Creed 4 (BF) before playing this game and holy cow are they drastically different. This game's combat is skillful and takes a while to master but once you get it down it becomes very fun. This is not like the last few Assassins Creed games where you can take on 40 dudes with your fist ( I tend to do that often in Black Flag), it makes you strategize and second guess if you should run in all willy nilly. This game has a decent story that can draw you in at times and understand character motivations. The evenings are stunning and the landscape between cities is drastic and it gives every place on the map its own characteristics, and makes them interesting. I would recommend this game, especially when on sale.

Been playing for over a dozen hours and barely touched any story. The world is massive and beautiful, might be the best I've ever played in a game. Side quests have a decent amount of depth and some of them get really intriguing. Progression is amazing, combat is challenging and makes stealth rewarding. Horse and movement mechanics are also especially good, probably the best I've played in a game.

PC port is pretty good but there is room for improvement, especially on the CPU end of things. Also think the games story starts off a bit shaky thanks to some poor pacing and cutting up of narrative. Thankfully, they spare no time throwing you into the world and this is a massive step up from games like AC3 that held your hand for hours.

Buy it if you can, this is probably the best Assassin's Creed from a gameplay perspective and it's slowly becoming one of my favourite experiences with the series.

Assassin's Creed : Origins Review

Finally an AC game made by one of the best teams in ubisoft, The creators of AC IV has released and ever since the day it launched i was sinking not my time, but my entire life in to it. so let me get one thing straight, I will not fill my review with c-r-a-p, so instead i will give my honest opinion about each part without talking too much ! So let's begin.

THE GOOD:
Huge open world. This is the biggest AC game of all time.
Map is filled with many superb things both in terms of quest and details.
Superb level of attention to details. If you love games like Legend of Zelda, Uncharted etc. for their attention to detail then this game is 100% made for you.
Graphics are literally the best. Remember those attention to detail thing that i have said earlier? now add amazing looking landscapes with superb detailed draw distances ( i have used the word "Deatil" too much, ikr ), Amazing Animations and a very good performance ( i will note my system info down below )
Sounds and musics are both out of this world. they will sink you in the game's world even more than ever. and yes ambient music is there too !
The main storyline and the way it is told is very well and decent.
The gameplay is by far THE BEST AC GAME OF ALL TIME (imo). too many different main and side quests, no more BS Fetch quests or tail this guard or steal that s-h-!-t. they way some side and main quests that are tied to each other is crazy !
Bayek!

and that's it for this part. now although aco is an amazing game, it comes with some minor problems ( again, it is in my opinion ) beware that the notes down below contain major spoiler for some parts of the game !

THE BAD:

Ok, they made RPG elements for this game and that is way more than great but the ui for weapon selection menu sucks and let me tell you why. back in 2009, In AC2 you had a weapon wheel. using it you could gain access to Ezio's Entire weapon list ( which was by the way larger than Bayek's ) with a click of a button, But in this game each time you want to use a new weapon you are forced to pause the game... kinda sucks imo.
You can mod this one but you can feel it's lack in the vanilla game. when you want to switch between weapons, they just appear from the thin air ! that's so not cool man.

Not a single aspect of "upgrading" a building like in the previous games. in AC2 you could upgrade the villa, in AC BH the entire city, in ACU the cafe but in here you can't do anything which makes me sad. i always wanted to make a castle in to the heart of Qattara Depression Section... something like Masyaf in AC1
Wish there were some multiplayer elements. you know like what? like Hippodrome online races, Online Arena battles, Some fun co-op missions featuring Bayek and Aya since those two are super lovely and interesting but sadly the potential is lost... at least in this game.

and that's it ! if you are not sure wethear to buy this game or not, I suggest you to get it immediately without even a moment of delay.

and finally my score is : 9.5/10

my sytem info:

GPU: GTX 1060 6GB
RAM: 8GB 1800Mhz
CPU: core i5 4460k

The game has a choice of 2 play styles:
Style 1:
i) Walk around a cluster of Scorpions
ii) Step on the scorpions
iii) Hear the squish and watch them die.

Style 2:
i) Stand still in a cluster of scorpions
ii) Watch them bump into your motionless foot
iii) Hear the squish and watch them die.

The game is okay.

I like that they changed the classic Assassin's Creed gameplay elements up a bit. It now resembles open world RPGs such as The Witcher. The revamped combat seems to draw some influence from Dark Souls but is of course much easier (but compared to previous AC games it is more difficult).

That's what irks me about it though: while this is all new for the AC series, it's all been done before and better in other games.

Some thoughts about various aspects of the game, not really a full review:

Main plot is the classic AC revenge plot. The main character (Bayek) is not so interesting. Occasionally you play as his wife (Aya) who is much more likeable and actually gets some kind of arc. They're no Ezio or Kenway.

Quests are mostly forgettable. Almost all of them are fetch quests + an assassination. This is mostly the case with sidequests, the main questline does have a few more memorable ones.

There are many characters, most of them uninteresting, I could only remember 10 or so. Human models and (facial) animations are not great. Sometimes you'll come across NPC's adressing a crowd with wide gestures. Gestures continue to play even after the speech has long ended. A minor problem but stuff like that is noticeable and breaks immersion.

While the game is open exploration is discouraged as quests always have only one entry point and win state. If you're in a location where a McGuffin is supposed to be, but the quest was not given to you yet, the object won't spawn. Find the quest, then return to the location. All of these places have respawning enemies. At one point in the game you'll come across a Roman citadel, 3 separate quests need you to go there, I did them all one by one and had to clear out the place 3 times... It's more efficient then to first chase every quest marker and only complete locations after you've done all quests.

Ubisoft has clearly found their sandbox formula and is sticking to it in this game. Clearing locations feels a lot like Far Cry. A location can be completed by finding all the designated loot and killing all the "special" enemies (captains/commanders) in it.

There are microtransactions but I haven't used them and they don't get in the way of the game. They work in a way somewhat explained in-game which is an okay way of doing this sort of thing if you have to I guess. Like other games they're lootboxes. You can get a lootbox for free each day by doing a quest and it sometimes gives you items that are a bit OP.

This all sounds very negative but there are good parts. This game can look absolutely stunning at times. Seeing Ancient Egypt in motion is quite neat, and the map is interesting enough to explore. I must be a sucker for completing locations on a map cause I've spent 60 hours doing it and also intend to play through the DLCs.

Ultimately seeing as I spent so much time with this game, I would recommend it, but it's not as good as AC2 or Black Flag IMO.

tl;dr
Game is average. Has many problems, but still fun to play. Beautiful open world.
I suspect mostly fans of the franchise will enjoy it but your mileage may vary.

Update:
Played the DLC's by now. The HIdden Ones is alright but Curse of the Pharaohs is really good, and improves upon some flaws of the base games. Sidequests aren't as disconnected from the main storyline, there's more cinematic cutscenes, and it's not as repetitive.

I spent 152 hours finishing the main campaign, side missions and other events which took me through just over half of the expansive and beautiful map that recreates ancient Egypt’s varied architecture and environments. It’s filled with areas of soft sand that are swept by dynamic sandstorms, ranges of treacherous and rocky mountains, catacombs of towering ancient structures built in the names of the gods, and the decaying shacks of the common people. Refreshingly, I discovered all of these things through an organic drive to explore, rather than through the series’ traditional structure of climbing to viewpoints to have them unveiled for you. There are plenty more secrets to uncover, and the delightful sense of discovery still hasn’t left me


Pros :-
------
1. Freedom of undocumented history
2. Challenging combat
3. Immersive Skill Graph
4. Enhanced Looting system for better Crafting
5. My girl , my favorite eagle scout
6. Economy( I just love the way they pictured economic system which has little to fair similarities to the economic system during ptolemaic dynasty, kinda fancy)

Cons :-
-------
1. Archaic weapons and technology
2. Mysticism more than realism
3. Maritime Focus ( it is already missing out the major portion with the exclusion of naval battles and sea fairing, so thats my reason )



Gameplay - 8.5
Story - 8.5
Graphics - 8
Presentation - 9

#Overall / Verdict - 8.5/10


Hence that is my Final Verdict !!!!

In a nutshell... this plays more like an RPG than an AC game. It feels more like Witcher 3 than Assassin's Creed. You don't even get the Hidden Blade till about 6 to 10 hours into the story, then you see why all Assassin's in the Brotherhood has their ring finger cut off :)

Make no mistake - this is truly an origins game. You get to see how the Assassins learnt their craft... sneaking, "Eagle Vision", etc. Yes they're rudimentary in the game but that's cuz this is the beginning of it all. You don't "git gud" like Syndicate. Plus, this is 49 BC, technology is at best, Bronze Age level.

The only gripe I have is that while I can rebind the keys to anything I want, both keyboard and gamepad, I just can't seem to "get it" to be the same as previous AC games... so in the end I gave up, reset to defaults and learnt the new layout. Which, frankly speaking, contributes to the feeling of an RPG game instead of an AC game.

I just finished the game, and it is far and away the best Assassin's Creed Game I have played. As a few of the major review outlets have already pointed out, there is much greater depth to the gameplay than in previous entries, and I'm fairly certain that a significant chunk of that extra year of development time was spent by the devs playing The Witcher 3 to see how an action RPG is done. I'm not saying that ACO is an RPG, but it certainly feels more like one than any of the previous games.

Egypt is gorgeous, Bayek is relatable, and the world is full of lore-enriching secrets that made me excited every time I saw a question mark on the map with a distinct golden tint. The side quests were typically well-designed multi-stage endeavors that made playing the role of Egypt's Medjay feel meaningful, as well as making the world feel very much alive. The main campaign is good, even great at times. Without giving anything away, the ending didn't have the positively hollow feeling that Syndicate's did, and more importantly, it felt earned.

The new gear system was appreciated in that it was fun and balanced, as opposed to the needlessly convoluted system of Unity and the overly-streamlined (but by no means bad) gear system of Syndicate. I actually liked that outfits were purely cosmetic with outfit upgrades existing as a separate crafting system applied to Bayek rather than to individual outfits. My only real gripe about the leveling system is that given the sheer amount of content in the game, the cap should have been higher. That said, you can keep unlocking ability points even after reaching the max level, and based on the number of abilities I never wound up unlocking, it seems like the ability tree was meant to be crafted based on preferred play style instead of being maxed out to the point where Bayek just becomes OP.

Performance-wise, the game runs just fine at high settings on a GTX 1060 with an i7 6700HQ and 16GB of DDR4. By "just fine," I mean that it never quite gets to a stable 60 fps, so I just locked it to 45 and enjoyed the game. I'll note that while 60 is always preferred, I'll take 45 FPS on a 4K screen at 60% resolution scaling. It still looked great, and all frame rates above 30 fps are above the "floor" of remotely enjoyable frame rates in video games as far as I'm concerned. But that's just me.

Might as well just add that this game did not murder my CPU. Optimization could have been a bit better, but I'll wait and see how things are several patches from now before giving a final verdict on that front.

Overall, this was an incredibly ambitious and thoroughly refreshing instance of an Assassin's Creed game, and I hope future entries in the series are more like Origins.

9/10

My first purchase from the Assassin's Creed series and boy do I have to say, it definitely wasn't disappointing. Great details in graphics, decent story plot, wide range of weapons and tools, and amazing combat mechanics are what got me hooked onto this game instantly. If you like exploring and like being able to assassinate a bunch of people /murder an entire army, I might say that this may be for you. Just buy it, stop hesitating.

It's a nice game that shows what faith means and where it comes from.
It uses incredibly beautiful places with historical themes,if you like Egyptian history, the game will be better for you.
Actually i was a bit tired until the last moments of the game but the last moments are really beautiful
it's worth the time you spend

I give this game a 9/10, as for the story its freaking awesome. the only drawback is the game maxes out my cpu all the time so i get about 50 FPS ... if they would push an update that would fix this i would rate it 12/10.

Don't buy this game until DRM is either removed or performance is not impacted by the DRM. My rig struggled to run this game well and it's a i7 7800x GTX 1080 16gb (3200) ram. Legit customers being penalised for the people who try and steal. This doesn't send a good message to people who do the right thing. #rant-over

Taking optimization aside.
This is one of the most amazing AC games that I have played. The world is so massive, beautiful and with tons of stuff to do that it can be overwhelming sometimes. :D
And the combat improved alot. It's no longer parry and button mash, it's more of a Dark Souls combat which is make it challenging and interesting.
And the side quests have so much variety that I'm very impressed. As for the story it did stared slow for me, but progressd fast and got really interested and Amazing toward the end. This really shows how Assassin's where made.
Overall I'm amazed with what Ubisuft was able to accomplish with this game, a complete change from traditional AC game into RPG. Again taking the performances issue aside.
Its the easiest 9.5/10 I have ever give to a game.

*Warning: Contains ingame Microtransactions and gambling

To start off, I have only played a total of 3 assassin's creed games. The original and first, Black Flag, and finally Origins. This comes from someone who doesn't really play AC games.



The good

The graphics - Absolutely stunning. Engine is giving it everything it can to bring ancient egypt to life.
The gameplay - I enjoyed the mix of stealth and updated combat system personally. Stealh was often the better approach since enemies could be extremely tough to take on more then one. Captains with shields would rentlessly assault you while archers on horses circled around you. Upgrades were unquie and very impactful over all.
The world - My favorite part of this game. The world was stunning, immersive, detailed, lush, hellish, busy, empty. So much detail to bring the world to life and frankly its up there with Witcher 3 on detail. From lush fields and oasis to the brutal, face melting deserts to busy cities on the nile.
"The Curse Of The Pharaohs" is seriously a great DLC that reminds me of what expansion packs used to be like




The Okay / Want more
The plot - Decent enough. Felt like I had rhyme and reason to hunt down and kill. Side quests are plentiful and sorta unquie. In the end, its all about kill X. I did feel like sometimes it progressed alittle too fast. Here is X, he is big and bad and hes dead now, okay next victim.
Needs a NG+ - Straight forward. Would love a new game+ but you keep everything and start anew.





The bad
3 layers of DRM - really? Who the hell needs / wants 3 layers of DRM? uPlay, Denovo, VMprotect.
DRM affects gameplay - While not 100% confimed, I think its safe to say the DRM is so heavy that people notice insane cpu usages melting their pcs. I maintained around 50-60% cpu usage even on a high end gaming pc.
Store - no, stop. No one wants to save time and buy your stupid "Helix Crystal coins" or whatever they're called. Stop. Just, stop.
Day 1 DLC - stop

AC Origins brings new ideas to a franchise that was getting burned out. The vast expanse of Egypt is breathtaking, there's so much content here, main story is good, sidequests can be repetitive, combat is fun but it's a lot of the same.
DLCs are good, especially "The Curse Of The Pharaohs", the plot was something I wished they did on the main game: explore more of fiction and go wild with it than to go with a realistic approach.

Good game, finally something different from Assassin's Creed. After 10 years that awful braindead counter spam combat is gone, that alone makes Origins better than any of the previous AC games in my opinion, except maybe 2 or Brotherhood because the story was very good in those games and the story in Origins is by far its weakest point.

The open world and exploration are some of the best I've seen in gaming, especially if you love ancient Egypt. One of the best experiences I had in this game was arriving in Memphis and seeing the Bent Pyramid of Sneferu in the distance and thinking, "hey I know that pyramid", then riding there on my horse and exploring the whole necropolis, turning a 5 minute detour into an hour of exploration. However I find the choice of Ptolemaic Egypt questionable, I was hyped for an Assassin's Creed set in ancient Egypt, but the Egypt depicted in Origins has seen 300 years of Greek occupation, and almost all the towns and cities in the game are dominated by Greek architecture and culture as a result. It often feels like a game set in ancient Greece rather than Egypt.

Bayek is a cool character, he's a religious and honorable man who cares for Egypt and its people, but he also has a good sense of humor. He's a likeable guy. However Aya is a horribly wooden and boring character and for some reason the game forces us to play as her on multiple occasions. The story is awful, and somehow gets even more awful in the 3rd act. I won't spoil any of it here but there's not much to spoil anyway, especially if you know the story of Cleopatra and Caesar in real life.

I want to mention the leveling system, in that I don't like it and it doesn't belong in the game. If you are 1 or 2 levels under an enemy's level, he will kill you in one or two hits, and it takes 10+ hits from you to kill him, playing on Hard difficulty. It's not like an actual RPG where you can be crafty and get around being underleveled, simply if you are underleveled in Origins the enemy will one shot you and he will be a bulletsponge to you. This forces you to grind side quests. I have almost 40 hours played but I'd say it's a 15 hour game if you didn't have to grind so many side quests to level up.

I liked Origins but it's held back by the awful story and soundtrack, which is basically background noise. The only good track in the game is the remix of Ezio's Family at the end which is mostly Jesper Kyd's work. But still the combat is decent for once and the open world and exploration are exceptionally good; overall it's a massive step up for Assassin's Creed as a franchise.

I did have some problems with crashing but it turns out it was a driver error on my part. The game runs alright, 60 FPS @ 1440p on my GTX 1080 Ti and Ryzen 5 1600 @ 3.8 ghz, but I think the performance could be better especially in cities like Alexandria and Memphis where it can drop down to 50 FPS.

Anyway, after experiencing some horrendous and frastrating crashing problem, I think this game is nevertheless, addictive, badass and wonderful.

I think I have to allege that this game deserve to share a place with Witcher 3 and The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. It is absolutely a classical world masterpiece. The reconstruction of ancient Hellenistic Egypt is beyond my imagination, even though I had stick with the traillers and journals before its release. For one moment I even admired the work of Ubi's 3D art teams, the graphic detail of this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy.

The only weakness, I think, is that the plot is still too 'Assassin's Creed' (After AC:Revelation. I did not play AC:Rouge though)... I still failed to catch the Ra of the story. But I did not finish the game yet, I should not come up with this conclusion too early, just mentioning it. And I do looking forward to a well-made DLC like Watch_Dogs: Bad Blood.


I finished the game. It is definitely worth playing as it provided one of the most gorgeous openworld RPG experience. But the story, as I said before, is too bizzare even judged by the standard of Ubisoft's scripts... Some cutscenes are awfully animated while some are truly satisfying, but it would not change the fact that the coherence of the story is badly constructed. Either way this is still a wonderful game for its fluent gameplay, good optimisation and nice graphic.

During the gameplay I experience multiple crashes and I still don't have it right and I struggle to finish the entire game (if you don't believe it, check out my achievements status lul). I discovered that the crashing problem is not a general issue, which is quite sad for me because I cannot get as much information that I need, however it also means that you should not worry too much about the glitchy experience as it happens only to a few people.

I bought this during the Christmas Sale last December, but just haven't had the urge to play it. Now it's hard to put down. Oh well, things come to those that wait.

To start with, the graphics, and music score will blow you away. There's so much attention to detail, that I rank it up there with my other three graphically appealing favorites: Arma 3, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Watch Dogs 2. These are beautiful games without any Mods. Fallout 3 to 4, and Skyrim, need Mods to achieve what this game does naturally.

Another new, and unique concept that I haven't seen in a game before, is a "Discovery Tour" mode. In this mode you learn all about the places you'll visit in Ancient Egypt. I'm currently in this mode, and will offer you guys plenty of breathtaking pics as I visit these sites. I'll most likely spend a great deal of time in this mode, as I'm often the explorer type when it comes to these RPG "Open World" games.

Speaking of pics... there is also a "Picture Mode" that lets you pause the action to manipulate the camera, and take shots in various ways. A feature I love in any FPS/RPG.

As of this review, I have approximately 10 hours in, and I'm loving every moment. Catch this on a good sale as it's on the pricey side, and play for just under 2 hours before returning it, but if you like it, keep on gaming!

For those of you that have missed it, or simply not following it, I thought I'd let you know that the next DLC for this game is coming on March 13th, 2018:

Overall a good experience, the wait of 2 years without AC was worth it for Ubisoft to re-evaluate their direction.

Story
It feels like the previous AC games (excluding Ezio timeline) where you fight against the Templars, yet you don't know why (except to get to the treasures of previous civilizations before them) which makes the future story lacking. All missions are focused on Egypt at the time of Cleopatra rise to power, with Caeser thrown in the mix.

The main narrative keeps you engaged for more content, with the side stories also having purpose and continuity. The DLCs are great, and I think the Hidden Ones are even better than The Curse of the Pharaohs since it has a continuous story with more relationships and culminations.

Speaking of which, the good guys turning bad in all stories are rather obvious from the start since they try to give you purpose in the game, but their beliefs are vague and mysterious.


Of course, the bad guys such as the Order, have their reasons and do not challenge Bayek to be better since they are short lived in the story. You only notice their beliefs once you have defeated them while everyone is telling you why they are bad. Maybe for the next game, they can switch this so that everyone tells you, but you have back-and-forth quests with the same bad guy similarly to Joker and Batman in Arkham series .

However, there are some copy-paste side quests where you need to go some place and get something, and then return. This is where the developers hit their time constraints when making this game, so they added a different dialog each time to give you a new purpose to finish them.

Scenery
This is where the game shines. Even though it's a desert and it's hard to put content there without looking blant, they have made compact environments (like Memphis, Alexandria and a lot of oasis) that pop out when you see them.

Since it's a desert, there are places where I feel the developers could have added more urban environments instead of leaving it as a desert. For example, there are 3 huge deserts where there are 1-2 treasures and nothing is happening there, so you leave that for last in order to 100% the view points synchronization.

However, you might notice that the Render distance is rather low, which makes the game feel like you are playing on PS4 where objects start rendering at somewhere 150-200m. On the other hand, The Curse of the Pharaohs has the best scenery in the game with all those flares, particle effects and changing environment based on the weather where the distance is so low, you wouldn't notice the rendering issue.

Another great feature is the Photography one, where you can share great sights with the community as they show on the map. Of course, you can also use this for spoilers or hard to find places.

Gameplay
This is not your typical AC game. They have gone in RPG-like direction, where if you previously can one-shot anyone, now you need to be 5+ levels above your enemies to beat them. This gives the game an incentive for players to grind for levels and items to become stronger. The fighting mechanics are good, with each type of weapon having an advantage over the other as well as Legendary weapons having additional perks such as Heal on hit or Instant charging .

Hopefully, they can balance the game more. For example, if you are 2-5 levels lower than your enemy, they kill you in 1-2 shots, while if you are 2-5 levels above them, you need to hit them 7-10 times to kill them. This means if you are lower by 2 levels, you will need at least 100+ hits to kill them, but if you are higher by 2 levels, they can kill you in 10-15 hits. This ruins the experience for players coming from other RPG games such as Dark Souls where by being skillful you can defeat anyone. For this to be a success, they need to add a unique strength/weakness to each enemy, similar to Shadow of Mordor .

Also they can improve the vision of the guards NPCs similarly to Metal Gear Solid: Phantom Pain where they can notice you from your shadow on the ground or while doing parkour on high places. Most of the guards I assassinated was because I was high up on a pillar and they couldn't notice me.

Another thing they can improve are the tracking animations of the opponents. For example, the Phylakes and one of the guards (the ones with big shields and sword) gave you this feeling that they fought as a player would with all the mechanics of the game. But, sometimes they will track on you, and their speed will increase, their animations will lose cooldown and their arm will go through their teammates just so that they can one-shot you when you are low health and even if you dodge, they will track you again without any cooldown of the previous hit.

History
After each story arc, you can enter Discovery Mode where you are narrated the history of the place with facts from historians and books. Of course, the game also tells you that some segments might not be 100% true since history has lost any evidence about some theories. At times I felt that some sceneries could have been added to AC:Origins since there were places in Discovery Mode that were unique to what was narrated like the death of Cleopatra or the rebellion with Ptolomey and Cleopatra.

In-game purchases
Mostly cosmetic and somewhat cheat-like add-ons so you can have more gold, or easier crafting. Some of those can not be unlocked without In-game purchases, but I never felt like I needed them. The only exception was the Nightmare pack with the Ghost Rider horse.

In the game you can get all the Legendary items yourself to look great and be strong while also grind the items to craft your gear. But, some of them are exclusive to the DLCs, so you will need to either buy the DLC or buy the others via the limited 200 Helix coins you earn in the prologue or Uplay currency by doing challenges.

Technical
They could have removed the Denuvo DRM once it was cracked since the additional DRM they added made the game badly optimized. With an 1070 and 7700k, this game never reached over 50% utilization on the GPU while the CPU was 80%+ on all cores because of the double DRMs. And, no matter how much I could OC my GPU, the framerates on 1440p would only go 1 or 2 frames. And speaking of frames, the jumps/drops were 30+ frames (80 -> 45, 49 -> 71, etc) while other games such as Tomb Raider would keep it between 60-70.

Summary
Overall 7/10 experience, where you grind to be stronger, defeat anyone that is not following the protect the innocent dogma while swimming-running-riding in this beautiful scenery called Ancient Egypt blooming with history and characters such as Cleopatra, Caesar, Isidora, Ptolomey and many others.

You do the copy/paste side quests to get levels
This makes you explore the beautiful map and help people with side quests
You continue with the story
You do random side quests to add diversity since you just assassinated 3 different bosses in same way
You go in Tombs and find cool stuff while also learn about history
You go to random places to find scrolls/bounties/weapons that reveal more about a story or side quest
You get attacked by animals and feel like calling PETA on yourself since you skin them for upgrades and trinkets

I would say ignore the negative reviews for this game. I played (and streamed) this game on a 5 year old AMD FX-8320 and 1070, and while the game had some fps dip issues for a few seconds at most and then was fine later, the whole game was completely playable and smooth looking.

The game itself was fun to play. Bayek was a good character, something that was missing from the series for quite a while since most of the previous characters weren't serious about their roll in the Assassin's and were just *there*. His story is more of an internal journey than the typical "I'm an assassin, it's my duty to fight templars".

Gameplay wise, it's a a lot different than the others. It sort of expands on Syndicates leveling system where if you're not in the right level range, you will be killed quickly and do very little damage to enemies. The loot system is pretty underwhelming, since for the majority of the game, you're most likely going to be using the same weapons you get early game and just upgrade them later to your level since you can pay black smiths to do that.

There doesn't seem to be much stealth aspect in this. You can still play it like an Assassin's Creed and bush camp kills or sneak around, but with the open world, there hardly seems to be any stealth routes you can take like in the older games. You can also throw stealth out the window and just run into places killing everybody since it's entirely possible to do that now with very little consequences.

The combat is fair enough. Like I said previously, if you're not within level range with enemies, you will die quickly by them. The majority of combat is mainly hack and slash with the chance to dodge or parry at the once in a great while moments. You can compare it to Breath of the Wild if need be.

The world is very large, and with that, is very disappointing in some places. There are zones on the map where it's just nothing but sand and rocks with no landmarks. It's disappointing since so much can be put into these areas, but there's hardly nothing. Don't worry about that, though, since the content that is in game makes up for it, such as the tombs in Giza or the side quests. Speaking of side quests, it appears that each zone has its own sub story for its area rather than a generic fetch/kill quest.

The leveling system is not really my favourite thing about the game. This is just me, but I'm not really the one who likes being forced to grind in order to do the main story. It may just be that they don't want people to go quickly through the main story or not, but there have been moments where I would spend 3-4 hours a day discovering/completing locations or doing side quests because there was a 3-5 level jump between main quest missions.

In all, I believe this game was great and one of the better Assassin's Creed story and character yet. While I'm indifferent about Black Flag, this game reminds me much about it (It's also made by the same team who did Black Flag, so that's probably why), mainly because it feels like a different game with a little Assassin's Creed elements put into it and got called Assassin's Creed.

Everything about this game is done right from the whole atmosphere of the world, the graphics, to the story. I really recommend checking out this game as it is truly a magnificent work of art! This is nothing like any previous AC installments, everything is completely revamped and executed perfectly. The only real gripe I have with this game is the combat, as it is really clunky and annoying to deal with, but aside from that it is definitely one of the best games that have come out in the past few years. Highly recommended!!

- Fantastic visuals and soundtrack create a really authentic world.
- Love the ancient Egypt background, myths, lore, weapons, etc.
- Plenty of options to approach an object (stealth, fight, use of environment)
- I didn´t feel like I "farm" the points of interest on the map rather than exploring them with joy
- The RPG elements were nice overall and not going too much in depth. To me it fits perfectly to the gameplay. It feels more like you unlock perks over time rather than becoming a real master of a specialization.

After 42hrs I´m level 35 with around half of the map explored and doing every objective. I guess this will be one of the few games that I enjoy so much that I´m going to get the DLCs.

Would I recommend it? Absolutly!

EDIT: finished everything in the base game after 72 hours. what an amazing journey!

I can happily say that it exceded my expectations altogether. This is the most immersive game that i have played since The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. The world is massive and i find myself getting distracted quite frequently.

Personally i have encountered zero bugs. Perhaps this is due to the day one patch and if that is true then it still doesn't give reason to try and convince people to pass on this game since there is obviously an easy fix. As for the problems people are having with crashes i havent had one problem. I dont have the best rig but with i7-7700 4.2 ghz GTX 1060 6GB 16GB ram. I have been running at ultra settings with 50-80 fps which is great to me because i dont have to have 100 fps to be happy as long as it feels smooth and looks good. I honestly don't understand why some people are having these problems and others aren't

•You can pull arrows out of your shield to use for yourself.
•You can put dead bodies laden with poison on the backs of horses and camels and send them into enemy encampments to poison crowds of enemies.
•There is now a loot system based on the rarity and attributes of equipment.
•Items can be broken down into crafting materials.
•Scoping out enemy encampments is now easier than ever with Senu.
•You can seemlessly explore underwater now for new gear or just for the fun of exploring.
•Viewpoints are no longer an actual necessity for opening up the world map.
•Animals can be tamed and become allies.
•Side quests tell their own stories similar to the way The Witcher 3 handled them.
•Everyone in the game lives their own lives which opens up numerous options for assassinations.
•The hood can be taken off and put back on.
•You can pass time with the press of a button.
•You can climb anything now so pesky mountains won't get in the way.
•We get to see the beginnings of the brotherhood as we know it.
•Stealth is still incorporating the awesome crouch and behind cover features from Unity and Syndicate but also adding a free aim bow for the first time.
•Senu can be called in to attack or distract which adds another useful and tactical element to scenarios.
•Combat has taken from the much loved styles of the Souls series and The Witcher 3. You are much more involved this time around and it isn't about button mashing counters and finishers anymore. This involves parrying, blocking, and dodging.
•We see the return of tomb raiding and it will be very beneficial for those who seek money, equipment, and earning skill points.
•Regular enemies will stand back and watch and cheer as you fight their captain single combat.
•You can light arrows on fire by standing next to any fire including your own torch.
•Enemy AI responds to just a glimpse if you by investigating the area they thought they saw something which is a big step up from the previous AI who would stand in place and look for a few seconds before deciding their minds were playing tricks. They will also hear an air assassination or headshot if close enough.
•Bayek is a well rounded character who is out for blood with an angry vengeance but often shows a lighthearted side as well.
•The story is well paced and you can walk away from quests now at any time without worrying about failing.
•Tailing missions are gone and replaced with finding out information through other more interesting and fun means such as investigation and interrogation.
•The formula has been changed dramatically from the previous entries in the series and has moved towards the more popular RPG style of game yet it still keeps important staples of the series.

The Game is Amazing
It's been awhile since I finished playing this (completed), I still go back every now and again, I'm not really a A/C fan, more of a Bayek fan, possibly my favourite character of all time.
The game is amazing.... but after awhile it's a little repetitive, now that I'm thinking about it.... I think I'll start a new campaign. I cannot recommend it enough, just checked out the price and you should wait for a sale, but everyone should experience this.

Superb entry in the AC family. Amazing presentation and immersion. Exploring tombs gave me a tomb raider vibe. The landscape are insanely large. What a treat to explore Egypt!

I love the fact they drop the old boring and tired combat of past entries and replaced with a more dragon dogma feel. Not as tight or responsive as dogma but still pretty good. Once you get the hang of it, combat flows well. Some can be thrown off by the combat early on but once you get the hang of it, its not bad.

The port is pretty damn good. I did not encountered any crash and game runs 60-65fps solid on my 1080ti with everything ultra except shadow, AA, and tessalation on High. Ultra wide support (21:9) is the best in a game i've seen yet. In game engine cutscene looks amazing and fluid with no black bars. Pre-rendered movies are 16:9 but extremely few.

Main potaganist is not bad, I actually like him, espcially once the story gets going. voice actor did a good job. Music not as good vs past entries but I didn't expect it to since this is Egpyt. Side quest are actually pretty fun and varied to my suprise. Overall, that extra year to create this game paid off and you can tell in many ways while playing.

As the first AC game I have ever played, I was not disappointed. This game is stunning in so many ways, and the story is compelling as well, considering (spoiler alert) we are forming the first assassins. I absolutely loved playing the first 50-60 hours of this game, Bayek is such a well-written and lovable character. After about the 60 hour mark though, it felt a bit repetitive and boring (but I mean, every game gets boring after a while). Same goes for the combat. Stealth is okay, but very basic for an AC game. Overall, definitely buy this game when it's on sale, it is immensely worth it!

This is a game that costs around 100 € for all content at full price. For this price the publisher still forces you to make a Ubisoft Connect account instead of integrating Steam's DRM. More importantly you always have to be online while playing. The game is also locked to your account.

Please consider this before buying and supporting a system that gives the publisher full control over your copy of the game. If you have a poor internet connection or might want to play in a few years after having changed email accounts, stay away.

You do not really own any game you buy on Steam but somehow you own Ubisoft games even less.

Those early reviews made me very skeptical, but I can assure you , this game is worth the price of admission. The story itself is ok, definitely better than the most recent ACs. However, the character Bayek is extremely well developed, and you will care more about him than the actual overall story. What's most incredible about the game is the open world itself, filled with details to the brim, creating one of the largest and beautiful open worlds I've ever seen. I'm spamming F12 left and right. The sidequests, although not Witcher 3 level, are clearly higher effort, and each have their own little stories and unique gameplay elements.

Most people complain about the combat, but I feel like not only is it really good, its also very challenging and different, depending on the type of weapon you're using. The parkour is extremely smooth too, utilizing everything they've learned from previous ACs and piling it all into one game. The naval combat from Black Flag returns as well. There's just so much stuff to do, and this time, it's not a repetitive grind filling the map. I feel like Ubisoft has really outdone themselves here. 9/10

The BEST SETTING in an Ac game, 100% completed in under 100hrs

Even though some quests may seem repetitive its overall a great game. The main game story is really well told and the main characters are well written and voice acted. That being said the Hidden ones DLC was short but enjoyable and COTP DLC was weak in terms of its story but it has the best map imo. The afterlife maps are so good U get lost by exploring them. Its a game for every AC fan.

Love the alternative history genre this games fits the best for not being too fictitious or too accurate

Personally i like AC Origin more than AC Odyssey, especially Bayek voice.

Bayek Voice is excellent compare to Alexios/Kassandra in Odyssey

U hear me UBISOFT, yes Bayek voice is excellent

Brilliant soundtrack, stunning graphics, convincing storyline and immersive semi-historically accurate gameplay. This game has it all, I therefore recommend it.

ASSASSIN'S CREED® ORIGINS.

The Assassin’s Creed series has had a tumultuous past. While the initial few titles were all bestsellers, everyone knows the debacle that Unity was. And the series, much like a few other Ubisoft titles, has seen its fair share of repackaging accusations. So, after another average outing in the Victorian UK, when Ubisoft decided to go back deeper in history with Assassin’s Creed Origins, I was definitely excited. But the question remained, was it worth it? Can it deliver on its promises? Let's find out.

STORY :

Just to keep the review as spoiler free as possible, Assassin’s Creed: Origins takes the game back to Ancient Egypt in the Ptolemaic era. The story focuses on Bayek, a medjay(an ancient pararmilitary police), and his journey to avenge his son’s death and deliver Egypt from its oppression at the same time. Along the way you meet many eminent historical characters like Cleopatra and Julius Caesar, as you travel across famed historical locations like Memphis, Pompei, Alexandria, Giza and more.
One of the strongest things about the story in Assassin’s Creed: Origins is the conviction with which Bayek’s character has been created. He is compassionate and vengeful at the same time, helping those in need while reserving his true rage for the people who have taken his happiness away from him. He comes across as human in his quest for closure, cracking jokes and being affectionate with his loved ones one moment and channelling his rage into his blade the next. Throughout the game, whether on the main quest or on one of the game’s numerous side quests, you will come across issues like racism, misogyny, classism, imperialism and others that have been depicted as earnestly as possible, while, at the same time, characters have been made to question the same. Overall, Origins weaves an interesting tale, one that could very well have the most character and depth of any Assassin Creed game so far.

GAMEPLAY :

Assassin’s Creed: Origins sets out with one goal – to redeem the AC franchise. It seems, that in a bid to do that, Ubisoft has added heaps of new gameplay mechanics and features. Not that we are complaining, it only makes the game more enjoyable and fresh, as compared to previous instalments which suffered from repetitive experiences across missions. A standard mission is still of the ‘Reach a place – kill (some) people – free some people/get some object etc’ structure, but certain missions take you into alternatives modes, like the exploration and investigation modes. Both of these are area locked modes, which means that the tasks required of you are to be done only within a certain area on the map, where the investigation of clues or exploration of the area will reveal further clues/objectives as and where applicable. The investigation mode, in particular, is very interesting as it has you looking for clues in your environment that lead you to the conclusions of many a mission.

RPG EDITION :

Assassin’s Creed: Origins goes for an RPG-esque approach on top of the usual Assassin’s Creed fare, with elements like crafting and looting being quite important to your gameplay. You also have an ability tree and level gating thrown into the fray. Each level you gain gives you ability points that you can use to unlock specific abilities, like the predator-bow mid-air control, sleep darts, or even just a half filled adrenaline gauge at the beginning of combat. This way, every person playing the game could be levelling up Bayek in their own way, making their own unique assassin for the game. Level gating does not mean that you’re stopped from playing missions – they’ll just be insanely difficult – especially when it comes to the combat..

COMBAT :

The fights in Assassin’s Creed: Origins is another area where you’ll notice considerable changes from previous entries in the series. Your armoury is quite diverse with melee weapons ranging from dual swords to power axes and everything in between, and ranged weapons ranging from rapid-fire light bows to the guided predator bows. Even the shield and tools you equip matter quite significantly and will affect how you dispose of your enemies. he lock-on mode that has been seen in quite a few melee combat focused games makes its way to this one too. Although it is quite useful when fighting a boss or a bigger enemy, and certainly a boon for horseback fights, it can be quite a limiting factor when you’re surrounded by enemies and would rather have a broad, tactical view of the battlefield. As mentioned earlier, level matters a lot in combat in this game, with assassinations and shield breaks downright not working against enemies who are stronger than you by more than a level. So it’s a good idea to stick to missions that are of your own level. Ingenuity – like shooting a fire arrow at the hay that your enemy is standing on, pushing an enemy into the water instead of duking it out with them or shooting an arrow through a flame to set your enemy on fire – will help you throughout the game.

GRAPHICS AND SOUND :

Assassin’s Creed: Origins pays a lot of attention to detail. Famous cities and towns are densely populated with people from all stratas of the society, with almost every person you interact with feeling and sounding unique. Each region has its own feel, with the quaint, homely streets of Siwa filled with colour and life in stark contrast to the dying and decaying alleys of Memphis. From people resting on rooftops in Egyptian slums to arguing with scholars in Alexandria to soldiers having lunch together on ramparts, to fishermen hauling in the daily catch cursing at you for blocking their way, the game has been designed to look and sound authentic. Which is why its problems stand out even more. The sheer vastness of this game is new to the series, which makes you feel at times that entire areas and sub-sections within regions have been templatized to speed up development. After a point of time, quite a few bandit caves and soldier camps feel almost exactly the same. And repetitiveness isn’t the only issue. In its bid to be an authentic game, Origins ends up ignoring certain design elements, especially its cutscenes, significantly. During cutscenes, there was clothes flying unnaturally, even going into the body or leading to a couple of virtual wardrobe malfunctions. Lip syncing is often off the mark, which is a shame with the beautiful voice acting that has gone into the game. And once the cutscenes are over, on several occasions thepeople and elements popped out of the ground and continued their normal routine.

FINAL VERDICT :

Assassin’s Creed: Origins bites big, and does a surprisingly good job of chewing it as well. With a few graphical hiccups here and there, the game stays true to the historical approach that the series was originally known for while bringing in a whole new level of depth to the series. Be it the well-designed locations, the immaculate portrayal of Bayek by Abubakar Salim, the numerous gameplay mechanisms that the game throws at you or even the classic assassination missions, there’ll be something in this game that brings you back to it again and again. Who knows, you might just have a thing for standing atop the Sphinx’s head, gazing into the distance wistfully while an eagle rests on your hand.

OVERALL : 8-8.5/10 (Highly Recommended for both the fans of the series as well as lovers of open world games)

Assassin's Creed Origins is the tenth Assassin's Creed game, developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. This game is made by the same team that made Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.

Any story must have an origin, and Assassin's Creed origins will provide all the answers to the questions related to the Brotherhood of Assassins: How did they form? Where do their three tenents come from? And many other questions that will be answered during the main story and DLC.

The Modern Day events are occurring in a cave of Qattara Depression, Egypt, where Layla Hassan, an employee of Abstergo Industries, is introduced to us. After four titles of the franchise, the player can again control the protagonist of the Modern Day in Thrid Person View. Although the "free roaming" with this character is limited only in the cave and up to a few meters outside it, the game touches the topic of nostalgia of the first games. Layla with the help of her own Animus, lives the memories of Bayek of Siwa, a Medjay of the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt and for a few moments, the memories of Bayek's wife, Aya Of Alexandria.

The game's story begins near Siwa, Egypt, the year 48 BCE, with Bayek assassinating his first target of the Order of Ancients, a group that killed his only son, Khemu. The death of his son turned Bayek into a killer, thirsty for vengeance. In his mission to make the members of The Order pay for what they did to his son, Bayek interacts with important historical personalities, such as Kleopatra, Queen of Egypt, Caesar, Emperor of Rome and others. Being left on an expedition and later returned to Alexandria, Aya introduces Bayek to the first origins of the Assassins, giving him the Hidden Blade to assassinate his targets. At the end of the story The Brotherhood of Assassins is born under its first name: The Hidden Ones. Bayek is not only a madman who desires revenge and turns his gaze only to death and suffering, but from contrary, he tries how much he can to overcome his son's death by keeping a himself quite happy and hopeful. The carsima and his lines of jokes, when appropriate, can be compared to Ezio's personality, Ubisoft touching the subject of nostalgia again.

Assassin's Creed Origins represents a new direction of the franchise, different from the other titles, through the newly adopted RPG system where you have to work to build your character at a great level. This Medjay of Egypt has a wide range of weapons, melee and ranged, and tools that will help in battle and stealth. Everything in the AC origins has been remade. Combat is acquainted with RPG elements, the player can now shield block, parry, dodge, light attack and heavy attack to eliminate his enemies, in a free and fast movement on the surface of the map. Stealth and parkour have been resimplified, but much more automated; we can even say that they were created specifically for those old times; animations are no longer diversified in climbing, descent and assassination, but reduced to just one aniamtion for each type of action. And it can be understood, because Egypt is not a place for parkour, it is based more on exploration and climbing in the vast majority on cliffs and mountains. The climb control became much more automatic, the player needing to use "free-run-down" only at very high distances of soil and "free-run-up" only when to climb and, preferably, when to jump from a house to the ground at a small distance, giving a feeling that you're a professional free-runner. Stealth has many opportunities due to the various tools available for Bayek: you can be a ninja who puts his enemies to sleep and then sends them to the eternal one, or a serpent that is poisonings those who want to harm him , or a DeadShot that delivers arrows to the soldier's heads. All of this remains at the player's choice. The Skill Tree is much bigger than Syndicate and Unity, featuring three categories that build Bayek in the Assassin desired by the one who controls him: Warrior (an unstoppable Gladiator), Hunter (an Assassin unseen by his enemies) or Seer (a Master of predictibility and strategy). Even Eagle Vision has been changed, saying that Bayek has an eagle view literally, because Senu is his eyes in the air guiding him to his objectives. Inspired by the drone of Ghost Recon: Wildlands, Senu can tag enemies for Bayek and even distract them, while Bayek delivers the Hidden Blade directly in their throats. In an adition of keeping the players however connected, Ubisoft introduces to the game the "Avenge side quest", where the player can avenge others by inspecting their dead body and killing the perpetrators.

The game map is huge. Ubisoft offers the player to explore Egypt at a very detailed level, where he can discover the ancient tombs of the pharaohs or the great palaces where they reigned. The diversity is present, only certain parts being covered in dessert, making the player to walk, with a camel or horse, through the exotic Egypt for hours. Introducing the Photo Mode, Egypt is the perfect location for those who want to take pictures with and exotic or artistic theme, thanks to the climate and shaders that the game has. The people and animals of Egypt are lively present in almost all locations. The side quests are huge and offers the player the opportunity to stay in contact with the game for very much longer after ans between the main story. People are having their own activities: the work in the day like crafting goods, fishing and taking food to their home and sleep at night. The animals are also living their life, every category of animal doing what they do the best. And speaking of side quests, some animals, mostly hippos and crocodiles, are attacking the nearby villages or people and if Bayek is near this conflict, he can save those people by killing the animal for a good reward of XP.

For those eager to learn about ancient Egypt, the game introduces the Discovery Tour mode, where the player can make free roam with a series of characters through the entire map of Egypt, at the same time starting tours about a subject of ancient Egypt.

At the end of the day, Assassin's Creed Origins is the answer to many questions and a new direction that can save the popularity of the Assassin's Creed franchise.

AC Origins Rating: 10/10 Shield and Sword

If you can bear with some FPS drops ( in cities and during certain events ) and random glitches ( horses can defy gravity and other wacky stuff ) you are up for lots of fun and challenge.

I completed the game on the hardest difficulty with full-legendary gear and mount, all I can say is no grind is needed and there's no need to buy stuff from store. As it clearly states - time savers and special items are there only to help you, their lack in the game doesn't hinder you in any way, in fact, there are much better items than those available by playing the game and completing ( side ) quests every now and then.

There are many interesting side-quests which will keep you busy and entertained, doing those will help you get stronger and richer ( literally ). You won't feel yourself doing stupid chores over and over for some NPC guy, instead you will find yourself being involved in events where your help really does matter.

Lots of hidden locations around the world like Ancient Tombs which hold an Ancient Stone, which rewards a skill point, along with lots of gold and treasures. Hermit places where you can rest will also give you skill points. Beating Elephant Riders ( yep game has those ) also gives you points. Did I mention Chariot Races and Gladiator Arenas? Well, there are certainly enough places for you to go should you get tired of treasure hunting or killing scum of the Egypt.

Many quests involve Egyptian / Roman Mythology ( knowledge of those Gods and Lore is not required in order to complete them ), helping you understand more about how religion and lives of people were entwined. Political situation betweem Egypt, Rome and Greece is well reflected in game - you can see who was prospering and who was suffering from intrigues, contracts and connections with authorities. Secret cults, grave robbers, bandits and other filth, infesting cities or lurking in the ruins - you will meet them all.

Game world is beautiful and full of shapes and colours. Lots of pictures made by other players will reveal sides you couldn't imagine to see. It is quite large and contains cities, forests, deserts, islands and even sea itself! You won't be walking on your two's alone - different mounts will help you travel quickly between areas that you haven't unlocked yet ( fast traveling to cities and observer points help a lot ), you can even use auto-travel option which works on areas with roads or just travel straight line automatically. It's very convenient and time saving. Random events on your way won't let you feel bored - a citizen may be in danger from a wild lion who's hungry or bandits camping poor merchant on his way to the city. Will you stop and change the fate of poor people or just go your way?

There are many other things in game which you can see yourself, as well as an option to avenge fellow assassin players. Should another player of similar level die somewhere near you, his corpse will spawn in your world and allow you to find his killers and punish them. Doing so will award you with sweet 250 XP and sensation of justice, delivered swiftly and righteously.

To sum up : It's a good and interesting game. Few bugs here and there and performance issues may still appear every now and then. Still, nothing stops you from completing it. If you want to play an RPG game in a world of Ancient Egypt, get it, you won't regret buying it.

Now that all the DLC is done I'd thought I'd give my 2cents on the game, this was my first Assassin's Creed game (yes I'm serious) and it was a blast to play. The sheer amount of effort, detail and love put into bringing Egypt to life makes the game stand out from others. Every village, every character, weapon, animal, and so on entices and draws you into the world. I never studied much history during my schooling years but the game made me very interested in ancient Egypt and the events that shaped that time, the added discovery tours are actually quite fun and informative.

The world exploration is good, it's a huge open world with the usual stuff. Outposts to clear, collectibles to collect, towers to unlock, I do enjoy the parkour aspect of the game and it feels solid. The stealth isn't super great but assassinations are nice to perform, but after you clear out 1 or 2 outposts perfectly it can get stale, armed with my predator bow it eventually became a chore. Combat is ok, probably not the strongest point of the game but apparently it's quite different and new for the series. I do intend to play the other games in the series so I will see for myself.

I think this game is worth full price, but if you are able to grab it on sale check out the gold edition which will give you access to 2 DLC's. The Hidden Ones and The Curse Of The Pharohs. I feel the latter is much stronger than the former, we travel to Thebes and visit the underworld of the ancient Egyptian gods. I loved this DLC and in many aspects thought it was better than the main game.

A solid all around game ticking the boxes in every aspect of gaming.

The game is amazing I have the Gold version.
It is an open world game like all the Assassin's Creed but with changes to the gameplay.
The graphics are amazing. Big storyline and many side quests, tomps for invastigation who makes you want play more and more until you finish it. In game shop to buy better weapons and shields.
But i have GTX SLI 1080 and the game is not support yet SLI, so I cannot play it at 4K 60 FPS maxed that is pain in the a...s...s... for 4K resolution. Besides is so unpitimised who I must disable SLi to play at 60 FPS...

I'm really digging this game so far, looks and plays great, I have not encountered a single glitch or bug and the graphics are stunning.

It is a little too easy, I am playing on hard and it simply aint tough enough.
Getting average of 50fps on max settings @1440p using a 980ti and it has dropped as low as 30 at times so be warned it is very gpu intensive.

Having one of the most impressive open worlds of any game I've played, with amazing visuals and an insane amount of attention to detail, on top of fun gameplay for both stealth and combat sections, a really good story, and a soundtrack comparable to the AC's of old, this game is a great purchase for people who stopped playing after the let downs of the games after 4, or people new to the franchise. This is, in my opinion, the best AC game we've gotten since Brotherhood.

Performance wise, I haven't had too many issues keeping the FPS stable, and it helps that the game has an option to dynamically lower certain settings as you play to keep it at a target minimum FPS. The CPU usage however does leave a lot to be improved on. So long as I'm paused it doesn't lag my system at all, but as soon as I return to the game programs like Discord start to lag hard. Don't let that dissuade you from getting the game however, it is necessary to point out though.

Overall, I'd highly recommend it.

A good game, though there are some things that are dealbreakers for some people and I'll list them first below.

- Firstly UPlay. Many hate it, myself included though it doesn't bother me enough to hate the game.
- Microtransactions. Yep, they are here and they are unessessary. They are not in your face about them but they are there.

Other than those things that may put off a few people the game is fun and I very much enjoyed it. The Hidden Ones DLC is alright to pass some time really just more of the same from the main game. The Curse of the pharaohs DLC is very good. The other DLC is a waste of money making the season pass also a waste.

so finally i finished the game + 2 DLC ( The Hidden Ones & The Curse Of The Pharaohs )

at first it feels so confusing to understand the base game and the RPG elements that added to game but after a few hours everything becomes so good and feel amazing and for me it was the perfect AC game after a long time

PROS :

-Story mode
the story is one of the brightest point in this game
walk and breath in of the first civilization country the Great EGYPT feels so damn good
you play as a Medjay as a father and at last as an Assassin to hunt down those who ruined your life and your Country
the Main Quest are really great as always and this time the Side Quest are not bad too.sometimes they feel as good as a main quest

-Graphic
to be Honest its one of the best video quality you see in AC games , sometimes I miss the AC Unity graphic but overal its so much realistic and alive when you walk among this great World

-Photo Mode
one of the reasons I play 200hr and not even got tired was because of this great features
its always fun to see from different angle of your world other than just third person
this features comes with variety of effects and colors and you are able to change the depth of field and so much more
almost it feels working with adobe photoshop or something

-Combat System
this time they redesign the whole system and its not bad at all
it almost feels something like Dark Souls games but still have a good balance between the weapons and bows

-Loot System
so for the first time loot system has its own way to AC games and im happy to say its really a good thing
you can find loots by killing enemies or by exploring that massive world

-Crafting system
this is one of the most part I enjoyed a lot
for upgrading Bayek you should Hunt a variety of different Animlas and i personaly spend a lot of time doing that in this beautiful world


CONS :

-Enemy Level up
so one thing i should mention about this is that it feels a liitle unbalanced to fight the enemies higher than your level no matter how strong you are but still cant beat someone higher than you

- No Multiplayer
its so disappointing that they lost this chance to have a Multiplayer features in this great world with tons of opportunity and variety of things to do

Game is amazing and it deservers 9/10. I recommend it and you should try, the expirience is awesome and worth your time, not only that you can play a game, you can also learn history

This game perfectly captures the mystique of ancient Egypt. I've had so many moments in this game where I'd just look at the Pyramids and feel overwhelmed, everything that I had ever read in the history books and articles about Egypt would come rushing back to me, leaving me mesmerized. It is not just about the Pyramids either, it is the atmosphere around the whole map. The artwork is probably some of the best that I've seen yet in a video game, and pair that with a great soundtrack and you have yourself a very decent experience.

The main quest-line is decent and hooks you in the moment you boot up the game, but unfortunately the side-quests are nothing new and sub-average at best. Unfortunately, Origins has RPG elements, so you need to grind out of a few levels completing those side-quests. Sometimes while playing it feels like some corners were cut, or are just not very well implemented. I give them a pass though, because this was Ubisoft's first attempt at RPG.

For a Ubisoft game from 2017, it is darn good, probably one of better AC since the Ezio Trilogy.

Bought this on sale. Worth every penny so far.
The scenery is awesome. Stunning. To see Egypt's ancient architecture not in ruins and with the paint and decorations is amazing. The landscapes are impeccable. The mountains, oasis, the desert sands, the caves are all spot on.
Main story is great. Side quests can be fantastic, however, some quests are just "boar meat" quests or "he killed my husband" type quests and do feel grindy, especially if they are associated with one of the "camps."
The gear system and it's ability to upgrade items is fantastic. The mount system is pretty darn good.
Switching between K&M and controller for alt tabbing or for using the bow in game or menus is flawless, like, insanely flawless.
I have encountered some bugs, mainly associated with f##k#n crocodiles. Also, I wish the main attack button was not RB, for melee it can feel clunky, I'd rather it be a thumb button.

Grab it on sale, don't bother with any in game purchases. Enjoy

Although a lot of speculation of how bad Ubisoft has been recent, I really enjoyed this game, its like they tried their hardest to keep the dying franchise the AC series alive with this game and they did ! great story, amazing, and I mean AMAZING visuals, kinda repetitive side quests but you can see they tried (?) totally worth it

Witcher 3 in Ancient Egypt with a touch of MGSV. Performance is ok, haven't experienced any crashes, just minor bugs here and there, considering it's the first day, it's in a great shape. I got around 50-60 fps on average on ultra settings, with an overclocked 1080 FTW, guess pptimization could be better but definitely not a big issue.

After 6 straight hours, I can confirm that gameplay is solid, AC should have gone total open world sooner but better late than never. Compared to Witcher, stealth, parkouring and archery aspect definitely adds additional levels of fun. The combat system is definitely an improvement over previous AC games, combined with RPG progression, it makes the game more complete.

The map is really huge, great job on the rural areas, but Alexandria was a bit let down, I don't know why but this major city feels too organized and not authentic enough.

- Second Update 15hr in, my experience is improved as the story developed into something more interesting, lots of dramatic moments and good enough twists. Also played the first naval mission, man does water look amazing in this game, best I've ever seen.

Game crushed for the first time for me but it happened during interacting with this new screenshot feature, during gameplay, haven't experienced any slowdown or bug.

I also see that the next major installment will definitely take place in Italy as Rome is heavily involved in the game and they already modeled lots of pieces & units etc. It will be either during the civil war of the first triumvirate or the second. Good job so far, Ubisoft, keep it coming.

While there is nothing really wrong with the game it is a bit too generic. All the quests feel the same: either assassinate or carry away your target. The dialog between Bayak and the NPCs are very uninspired and I had trouble listening to it (since it just boils down to the same type of quest). It just makes it very hard to immerse yourself into the game as Bayak. I actually felt a little bit sad for the artists that created this vast beautiful world since there is nothing to do.

I was doubting between a positive or negative review since it's not really a bad game. However there is also uPlay: multiple times I couldn't launch the game because of uPlay not being able to synchronize Achievements, Cloud Saves or activate the product...

I did not expect much at first but i absolutely loved this game!

Game Completion = 100% , I did every story/side missions , Scrolls/puzzle's ,Every Achievement for both the main game and the DLC's (The hidden ones & The curse of the pharaohs)
Took me around 156Hours to beat all this on the hardest difficulty!

The game was smooth with around 65-85fps on maxed settings and i use
Ryzen 7 1800X
GTX 1070 Strix OC
32GB DDR4 RAM
Gigabyte gaming k7 motherboard.

+Amazing use of the egyptian setting!
+Good voice acting.
+Enjoyable story.
+ALOT to do ingame.
+The game looks absolutely stunning on ultra graphics!
+The open map is great + the sandstorm when u ride thru the desert is amazing!
+The heat strokes you can get if you are in the desert for to long can be pretty cool , like the raining bugs ;)
+The Discovery Tour in the game is good!
+ The expansions was great!

Imo the discovery tour was really intresting if you wanna learn more about the egyptian history and information about the game and how accurate they really are with all the npc's doing their daily routines , details in the world , art on the walls/urns and tombs and much more , You can really see the effort they put in to make this game.

By far the best Assassins Creed game i've played and i recommend it 10/10!

Between this game and the other Assassin's Creed games, this game is phenomenal. My rating for this game is going to be slightly lower because I do not like the new level system, but I suppose it is for the greater good, because now people cannot rush in the story, and have to level up.

Game overlook:

Enviornment:
No words can explain the stunning world of Assassin's Creed Origins. The map is practically twice as big as Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, and with so much more to do in the maps. Even the animals are unexplainable in words. Predators actually have an instinct to scavenge, and attack. In rare events, you can see a lion or cougar hunting in the wild, which is a true thing to witness. Not to mention the graphics.

Story:
The story is actually interesting, unlike some of the other Assassin's Creed Games. Do not hover over the black texts if you want spoilers. 

Combat:
The combat in this game is familiar to almost every Assassin's Creed game, but with a few new weapon types, meaning for more fun. Be aware of the enemies levels, as higher leveled enemies then you can take you down easily, and without effort.

The game is enjoyable, but the leveling system force you to do side quests which are too repetitive and boring. The ending is a bit rushed. Micro-transactions locked you out from most of the game contents. It's not worth it.

The best combat system PERIOD.

Even if hyenas kinda buggy inside stones and fps kinda spiky on huge city, the game still please me with their dedication for making egypt so damn good and perfectly historical. I've played 3 days full and still on 1/4-1/5 story, A lot of side mission to grinding level, and the missions are not repeatable and boring. The missions are very amusing. Pyramids are kinda short to explore but you gain 1 ability points just by hovering your torch and said one sentence.

If you're into history and action, this game is a great choice, if you plan on buying it.
+ The graphics are great.
+ The animations are smooth.
+ The gameplay is diverse.
Definitely get it if you're a fan of Assassin's Creed series of games.

This game looks really good, and it seems to have an interesting story, but all of that is thrown down the drain by this game's terrible optimization. I was unable to maintain a consistent 30fps with a Skylake i5 and a GTX 970 on low/medium settings. I would never recommend anyone buy this game in the state that it is in.

Assassins Creed: Shadow of Memphis

You're on the fence about this game.

The last ones were pretty samey, if not just not fun. Every iteration felt more ubi-soft than the last (Towers, collectathons, superfluous present day story setups)

This one looks fresh. Maybe.

Big pluses I found. The first hour or so had no real tutorial. Assassins Creed 3 had a 15 hour tutorial. Big improvement. You're left very much to your own devices interms of progression. The skill tree looks alright.

Eh stuff, enemys are leveled to soft gate you towards certain areas. There are weapon drops and upgrades. The game just starts. You get a brief flashback to your village burning down or something, its not really explained who you are or what a Maji is (Desert wizards?) and then all of a sudden you've killed one of the primary story targets and you're riding back into town after a year.

I may have skipped a cutscene. Maybe not. There wasnt any present-day techno nonsense to ruin things so that was a big plus. But what was there really didnt hook me.

Returned it because it was a 'maybe' purchase that didnt stick me, and it ran like a man caught in a rip. Breaking the surface of 30fps, before dropping down into the low 20's. If you can get a consistent 45-50 on high some of the more opulent settings, I bet it looks great.

Dont do drugs.

Apart from driver timeout crashes on my AMD card, this game is fantastic. Really love the main story and the gameplay the only let down for me was the crashes. Quite frustrating cause the game kept crashing during combat and few cut scenes but I made it through somehow. But I won't take anything away from this game its amazing!

Edit: I just want to add that the Discovery Tour mode is incredible! Original review below.

Have completed all the AC games (other than Unity and Rogue, and some spinoff Chronicles titles), and thought the franchise was doomed. I am pleased to have been proven wrong. The story is decent, and side quests are no longer fetch this, liberate that, save a fourth, stab a fifth. They can even span multiple regions - I helped out some kids in Giza (might be some other region, I don't remember), and then sent them to Memphis. A few hours later I ventured into Memphis to continue the main quest, and found myself face to face with the kids I helped, and they remembered me (even giving me a nickname)! I just felt obliged to help them again at that point, so I did another side quest. I'm not a completionist, but I have a feeling that I'll be doing a lot more of these side quests, just because they're so memorable and entertaining.

Also, quite a few snobby brats are complaining that this won't run on their insane 7.0GHz, 1024GB RAM, with an SLI setup of a dozen GTX1080s. I can run this on Very High at ~60fps on an i7-6700K, 16GB RAM, XFX RX480; and everything looks amazing. But then again, I'm not gaming on a 4k 144hz 60inch TV, so I might be missing out.

Either way, still worth checking out, in the past 75 hours or so, I have:
[Killed / Gotten killed by / Run away from] a variety of wildlife (you get an achievement for running away from a hippo 3 times).
Tamed a crocodile (guards killed it later).
Tamed a lion, set him up on a date with a crocodile, he defeated the croc, but then a ship sunk my boat. Together with my kitty. RIP my Leo (11/24/2017 2:55 AM - 11/24/2017 3:02 AM).
Saved a few pets.
[Stabbed / Punched / Shot] enemies.
Pushed enemies into water (some NPCs can finally swim!).
Set enemies on fire.
Set myself on fire (seriously, don't smash an oil pot with your torch).
[Saved / Killed] a few people.
Made love.
Almost slept with Cleopatra.
Toured Alexandria as Cleopatra.
Flew an eagle.
Fought a god after being empowered by another god.
[Crafted / Dismantled] a bunch of stuff.
Taken a load of pictures (check out my screenshots!)
Climbed a load of buildings (I mean this is AC, what did you expect).
Explored the Pyramids.
Hallucinated.
Stargazed.
Gotten high on some ancient potion.
Gotten saved by my eagle from a snake (this wasn't a cutscene - it was in game, during combat, my eagle just swooshed in and took out a snake I hadn't noticed).
Taken a bath.
Raced in the hippodrome (this is painful, and I wish they didn't give you steam achievements for this, I don't want to do this again).
Gotten buried in the sand.
Lost a finger (this is not a spoiler, Altair was missing a finger, this explains the tradition).
Battled at sea.
Investigated.
Fought a variety of ancient egyptian gods.
Learned a fun fact about Alexandria that I think is going to stick with me for a while.
- etc. (this list is getting too long, but I can occasionally add to it if people are interested).

READ FIRST: Given what I've seen of the game, I would probably have recommended it. But my experience has been negative so I'm giving it a thumbs down.

I thought I had a pretty decent rig. I can run most games on at least the high settings, if not ultra. I was excited to play this game because from what I'd seen, it was a refreshing take on the game with some key changes made to the gameplay. It looked like the extra year of dev time payed off.

Sadly I've had to refund this game because it was running poorly even with everything set to medium. Yes, I could have set everything lower and maybe had a decent framerate, but the game would look garbage and I can't be arsed with that. At the same time, running a game at sub-60 FPS is just something I can't tolerate these days. The game may be good, but the performance problems I've faced and the fact that I've refunded it means I have to give it the thumbs down.

My specs:





It's probably time for me to upgrade my graphics card, but until I can I'll have to leave this game unplayed.

On a side note, one thing that did have a negative impact on my experience, even for the short time I played the game, was the awful in-game advertisements for microtransactions and DLC. I spent literally all my time with the game in menus trying to sort out my graphical settings, and I was constantly having to skip through pop-ups. That's ridiculous. I've recently been warming to Ubisoft despite focing Uplay down my throat because of the support they've been giving Rainbow Six Siege, but these adverts have ruined any chance of me trusting this company again.

I expected the world of ACO and it... honestly delivered and then some.

This is probably the first time since TW3 that my massive amount of hype pre-release for a game has ever been fulfilled.

I haven't ever truly been excited for an AC game, Black Flag was likely the last one I was genuinely hype for just because I love the age of pirates.

How fitting then that that same team gets to do the next setting I was stoked for: ancient Egypt.

And it delivered in spades: it's beautiful and extremely fun to explore, it has memorable and relatable characters, the combat system is a bit better than past games but it definitely needs more kill animation variety, loot variety is great... love the visual design of everything, and best of all: the ubisoft open world bloat has been reduced dramatically and replaced with a million side quests with stories so now I have a legit reason to want to go everywhere.

Of course, it's not perfect: back to the loot... it has great visual variety, sure, but it lacks a lot in attributes and elemental affixes to make it actually rewarding, a lot of characters and (side)quests are memorable and a lot feel like they had a great idea but then forgot what they were writing about and promptly dropped them before they could get any real resolution... comes with the territory of having so many quests(and obviously not having the level of skill that TW3 writers have) I suppose, and the post-release content, aside from the generally great patches, leave a lot to be desired... it feels like they half baked everything so far; outfits miss physics interaction or effects that you'd think they would have... same thing with the mounts, or the fact that the FF15 event is just so amazingly LAZY(quest length and the 4 legged chocobo camel mutant what the hell) compared to the Square counter-part, the trials of the gods all basically being copied and pasted, and the packs are ridiculously over priced.

Overall though, it was a lot better than I expected and I can forgive the faults based on the ambition of the game alone.

I'm just a little wary about the expansions they'll be releasing if their current offerings are any indication of quality control.

It's been a long time since Ubisoft produced an AC game of this quality. Where the last three or four installments repeated the same old stuff over and over, Origins is a succesful attempt at revitalising the series as a whole. With new gameplay, a proper story and more quests than you will ever complete in a lifetime.

Origins does away with the traditional progression system and now has an RPG like leveling system. You will find many different weapons with many different stats on your quest, giving you plenty of choice in how to slay your enemies. On occasion this can get annoying as you toss aside your 50th sword for a new one, but overall I'd say it works fairly well.

Luckily most equipment can be broken down into raw materials that can be used to improve Bayek's armor, blade, arrows and more. Getting all these things to their max level is a quest all of its own, and will require much hunting for animals, ambushing cargo transports and infiltrating the many forts dotted on the map for unique material.

Assassin's Creed Origins is by far the largest AC game I've seen to date. The map is enormous, with many towns and cities to explore. Each will have their own side quests, some simple, some complex and lengthy. The main quest will require at least some side quests to be done to raise your level and equipment. Overall the main quest can be completed in about thirty to forty hours, but completing all the other activities on the map and upgrading all your gear will take a multitude of that.

Special shoutout to the story. It's well written, and doesn't focus too much on the founding of the Brotherhood. Instead it tells its own story and weaves the origin story in where it fits. There are many call backs to the older games, which fans can surely appreciate.

If you like Assassin's Creed this is definitely a title worthy of the name and hopefully a taste of where the franchise will go in the future. Highly recommended to get during a sale, but since the game can throw possibly a 100+ hours worth of content at you, it might even be worth it to you at full price.

Assassin's Creed Origins is fun, more often than it isn't, in fact. However it's not so fun that I can truly recommend buying this game. Note that as of this writing, I have only played the base game.

Firstly, the story. You play as Bayek of Siwa as he seeks revenge for the murder of his son. It's fine for the most part, not great but not that bad, though it feels like the third act takes too long to get here and is too short once it gets here. I feel this may also be a consequence of another part of the game I'll talk about later. For now, though, I can say the plot itself doesn't really waste much of your time with menial nonsense where you get sidetracked, every target you eventually assassinate has a reasonable amount of build up. Any filler the story might have had is relegated to sidequests, making them "optional" as you play through the game.

The sidequests are interesting enough, some are multi-part quests with an overarching plot throughout, others have several unexpected twists and turns within a single quest, while others are as straight forward as they seem on the surface to make sure you don't just start expecting surprises at every turn. Sometimes, once a side characters' quests are done, you can even still see them elsewhere in the world and have a quick chat with them. Unfortunately, at some point, all the side quests just start to blur together and it becomes hard to remember what a quest did unless I did it recently.


Of course, talk of story is all fine and dandy, but what of the game you experience that story through? So let's move on to the parkour.

It outright sucks. High profile, the last remnant of the original Assassin's Creed's marionette controls, has been removed with running now being the default movement. Simply moving Bayek is as functional as you'd expect but parkour is a shadow of its former self. Advanced parkour maneuvers still exist within the game but they're finicky to get working without a lot of practice and are context sensitive like Unity and Syndicate. Here, the only thing I have managed to get working consistently is deciding whether or not to leap off a ledge or drop off gracefully, though even then sometimes the game just wouldn't let me jump off if the angle of my movement input wasn't far enough away from whatever beam I was walking on. While Origins hasn't really removed much more parkour moves that Syndicate didn't already cull (goodbye vaulting, who's animation still exists within the game but is unusable outside of very specific places), what remains has had its utility stripped away with side/back ejects no longer gaining height. If you truly had the will to do so, you can learn the game to the point where you can make something of the parkour here, but it's just not good enough to justify the effort required.


Next to step up to the plate is combat. Firstly, for context, I played this entire game on hard with enemy level scaling on to insure I never benefited from becoming over leveled and I never used the Animus Control Panel. Now, the combat system on paper is fine, you have a light attack, heavy attack, shield, and dodge available without a resource tied to it. You also have smoke bombs, fire bombs, a special attack unlocked when you earn enough meter, and a few ranged options that you can naturally flow into and out of. You're really not starved for options here and moments where your ingenuity becomes the difference between life and death, it's even fun.

But the actual feel of controlling Bayek leaves me wanting. The best way I can describe it is that the man himself feels slippery in a fight. If you're not careful, you can end up wiffing attacks and eating hearts for it. Using your shield to keep Bayek facing where you want seems to be the best way to maintain the most control. The feel of attacks themselves are serviceable, your weapons feel like they hit something when they connect but only to the point where it'd get a passing grade, if you want a visceral feeling, Origins does not deliver.

You are only half of a fight, so what of your duel partners? They also get just a passing grade. They'll shoot arrows at you if you run and sometimes even try to maintain distance to stay safe. Up close, they will use shields if they have one to stay safe and require you break through it or slip around them to get some damage in. Their health generally well balanced when around your level and don't take too long to kill as long as you put in a little bit of effort to keep your gear up to par. Bosses are varied when viewed as a whole but rarely are that interesting of an enemy when viewed individually. There's only one boss that I thought was truly good and it was an optional side boss you can only fight sometimes, and even then it would have been a decent mid boss in another game at best.


This leaves us with the last main gameplay pillar of an Assassin's Creed game for us to take a look at, the stealth. On its own, the stealth is barely functional. Your options for remaining undetected are simply avoiding line of sight, using bushes to mask your presence, making your eagle harass a guard to stun them, whistling to lure guards, and using sleep darts to temporarily stun enemies. The detection system is one I can't truly say I managed to understand by the time the credits rolled. It works as you'd expect most of the time, but there are some instances here or there where you don't expect a guard to see you. With sleep darts, you can use them on guards to save a stealth run and kill them before they wake up. There, sadly, really isn't too much to talk about with stealth, which is the big issue with it, like everything else, it's content being just serviceable. The places you sneak through are generally fine for stealth if unremarkable as only a few (and I really mean a few) places are memorable and they're all late game areas.


Next on the chopping block is the open world itself. It's Egypt. The space between cities isn't filler, but it often feels like it is.. It feels like a real world that's lived in and dangerous but by the end of the game I didn't want to interact with the wilderness outside of necessity. The cities themselves are cities alright. There'll be some parkour routes here or there but it'll be rare that a possible route doesn't seem incidentally there. These don't feel like maps you're supposed to parkour on and the only thing they do to try to convince me otherwise is the fact that some roofs have clotheslines connecting them.


Lastly, the series now being an RPG. I feel the most negatively about this above everything else. It doesn't add anywhere near enough to justify the damage done to the experience as a whole. You now have different weapons and shields you can equip that each have their own traits and stats and the ability to upgrade anything you want to keep using should you favor one weapon over another. These stats just govern the efficacy of its main use, i.e. damage for your weapons. Traits are where any possibility of build variety come into play. I could never really find anything with traits noteworthy enough to justify using over any other.

Where issues really start to arise is with enemy scaling and how I can describe it no better as being outright hostile towards the player. As enemies become too strong, your tools become useless. Sleep darts work but have their functionality stripped as enemies wake up far faster and the game no longer allows you to assassinate them in their sleep, your hidden blade itself can't kill and will trigger open combat if you try, and you do poor damage on top of all of this.

It also affects the pace of the story as you're forced to spend time playing sidequests in order to level up as story quests will not give you enough experience to keep up with the plot, effectively forcing back in the filler the pace of the story otherwise managed to avoid. I have more to say but I can only contest with a character limit for so lo

AC Origin was a nice come back for the series. After playing Origin, this might be my one of favorite AC games right after AC 4:Black Flag, and AC2. The open world are full with life, every NPC doing their own sort of activities from fishing, farming, mining, building, some children playing in the alley, and even Egyptian, Greeks, and Romans has their own type of activities. Travel into the desert in the middle of day can make your character hallucinate, like seeing fish, flowers, and even Prophet Moses turning His staff into a snake XD(that one just give me a goosebumps). Day and night activities were also different. The intention to details is spot on.

Bayek as the main character, he is just "OK" nothing surprise me or make me like him, unlike Ezio and Edward Kenway who is a real badass in my opinion. So for the bad guys, hmm they just blend some of them doesn't get any proper introduction that make you want to kick their asses so bad and kill them. Only one old lady that will make you angry AF other than her well not so good.

The story it self is a bit in the slow side it depends what type of player you are, rushing through the main story or just playing around doing side quests. Although, some side quests not that great but some of them provide you with a decent lore about Egypt and AC Origin world.

Also one more thing, the open world have a very great scenery if you can set your graphics on Ultra. You can take a screenshot that will looks like an illustrations XD

The optimization were also good enough, i can run it on Ultra in 60-75 fps 60hz screen. (Only if you use high end dedicated GPU)

Overall not to shabby, love it, especially with 2 DLC which is i'm not try it yet.
Pay it with a half price it will worth your time.

(warning don't buy any microtransaction that Ubisoft put in the game) LMAO

8.9/10 (remove the in game store then i will give this game 9.5/10)

Long ago,
when the pyramids were still young,
Egyptian kings played a game of great and terrible power.
But these Shadow Games erupted into a war that threatened to destroy the entire world,
until a brave and powerful Pharaoh locked the magic away,
imprisoning it within the mystical Millennium Items.
Now, 5000 years later,
a boy named Yugi unlocks the secret of the Millennium Puzzle.
He is infused with ancient magical energies,
for destiny has chosen him to defend the world from the return of the Shadow Games,
just as the brave Pharaoh did,
5000 years ago.

I would recommend this game because simply, it's great. BUT the performance issues are what really hold it back, using a 6-core i-7 with liquid cooling, GTX 1080, on an SSD, running it at 60fps with no stuttering, so whats wrong? Dont plan on running this game at ultra high unless you really want to burn your CPU up, i was hitting about 60c on ultra high when most games i hardly break 50c on the same settings. People are blaming Denuvo/VMWare, using a double anti-piracy program which really taxes the CPU which i would have to agree with, idk what game ive played recently that has just put my CPU usage to 100% constantly other than this one. Ubisoft needs optimize the game so it doesnt hurt gameplay for customers who actually paid for it.

Do not buy anything from ubisoft. I bought this game a couple years ago, didnt play it much. Then when I went to play it again, U-play said i didnt own it and refused to launch the game. I then went through a bunch of different things the customer support told me to do, none of it helped. Even with my receipt from steam they cant do anything. So im basically out the money now. Then the cusomer support got very unfriendly and seemed like they turned into robots. Kept asking the same questions over and over even though I already answered them then just all of a sudden said "im sorry you wish to close and resolve your case, if you need any further help please let us know." I then immediately deleted my account, over 9 years with multiple games. Worst company ive seen in a while. Think ill go play CyberPunk 2077 now, that has been a much more enjoyable experience, and no im not being sarcastic. Please refrain from buying any ubisoft products unless you want your money/game to be taken from you down the road.

This may be the best Assassin's Creed we've been given in a long time.

The 1 year hiatus was defintiely worth it for the huge quality jump Ubisoft put out for this game.

I'm a huge fan of Black Flag and this game is simply fantastic in its gameplay, world, etc.

Bravo Ubisoft for proving the doubters wrong.

This game settles a before and an after for the whole AC saga. There are many relevant changes and not only graphic, but the new battle system, different weapons to explore and master, kill in different ways and not only the old strike-to-the-neck assassination, exquisite lore and information for whoever loves Egyptology and a well built skill tree to construct at your will and preference.

You should buy this game just for the Discovery Tour alone. You might learn a thing or two about ancient Egypt.
The game is very beautiful. You just get lost in the landscapes. Trust me! gameplay and story doesn't matter in this game. Just go and explore :D

We’ve all been there. You get super excited for a game, you pre-order it, and you anxiously wait as it downloads. Then you finally play it. How do you feel now? If the answer is “Elated beyond words because even I, a conductor aboard the hype train, was blown away with how good this thing was” then you have found the perfect candidate for this award.

I haven't played an Assassin's Creed game since IV Black Flag but this has been a really positive surprise, enjoying this one more than I thought I would. It has an immersive open world, plenty of quests, good combat and story, but what I'm really loving is that they made it an RPG and that it's set in ancient Egypt. 9/10, highly recommended. (I've still got the DLCs to play)

Assassin's Creed Origins is a revenge story where you take one the role of Bayke, a father whose son was killed by a shadowy group called 'Order of the Ancients'. During your journey, you'll also have the option to take on countless side missions... well, about 182 but it will seem countless.

Pros:
Excellent animations
Many MANY hours of game play
Spectacular graphics
Huge open world
Well optimized
A few puzzles to solve
Voice acting is decent
Non-linear

Cons:
You are forced to sign up on UPLAY
Hippodrome races are set much MUCH to hard
The story is a bit on the weak side
The game crashes on start up from time to time
You play three different characters
UPLAY

After 200 hours of game play, I finally finished every side mission, the main story, the DLC, looted all of the treasure and killed the Captain and Commander in every fort. Then I got every achievement that I missed during all of that. This is by far, the longest game that I every played and it's easy to see why this game is $100, however, I got it on sale so I really got my money's worth.

It took a bit a time to get used to the controls but once you've master them, nothing will stand in your way whether it will be an enemy, a building, or a mountain. There are several different types a assassinations and some of them are quite humorous so I suggest that you experiment with them and find the one you like the most.

The one thing that I really didn't like about this game is that you're story is interrupted from time to time and you're all of a sudden playing a different character. This happens about 5 or 6 times and it seriously p!ssed me off because the character I was forced to play is far weaker then the one I have been working so hard on to level up. I hated that. It was L.A. Noire all over again.

The last thing that I really hated is the F@CKING hippodrome races. Even on easy mode, I can not get past the second race, and there 4 all together. HEY UBISOFT, TONE DOWN THE HIPPODROME RACES DOWN ABOUT 157 NOTCHES. It's in insanely hard to win.

At the time of this review, Assassin's Creed Origins was selling for $99.99 (Gold Edition). With all there is to do in this game, I think that's a good price. However, if you're frugal, like me, wait for a sale and get it for around $23.00.

This might be the best game Ubisoft's ever done. It's definitely their first game in the last five years, I wanna say, that has some distinct character to it.

I think we've gotten three technical masterpieces on PC this year: Resident Evil 7, Wolfenstein 2 and now Assassin's Creed Origins. It's one of the best looking games I've ever played. The animations are incredibly well done, the world actually feels unique, which has been one of my main complaints with Ubisoft games lately, the lighting and shadows are drop dead gorgeous and it just FEELS like you're there, two thousand years ago in Ancient Egypt.

I really dig the new combat system, it's really similar to games like Breath of The Wild and Dark Souls, although not as deep as Souls and not as enjoyable as Zelda, in my opinion. Movement is so much better than in previous titles, your character controls great and the horse and camel riding mechanics are super enjoyable and fluid.

I haven't experienced that many bugs and the game's been running fine for me at 1440p, and it's utilizing my system to the max, which is what you want really, even if it means some drops from the target 60fps, consider just how great the game looks.

I'm honestly shocked by how good this game is. It's shaping up to be one of the best games I've played all year, and definitely the best Ubisoft title I've played in the last five. If you're a fan of games like The Witcher 3, Metal Gear Solid V and the latest Zelda, this is kind of a must-buy, in my opinion. It's genuinely great.

I have such mixed feelings about this game, having not played an AC game between AC Brotherhood and this one. While visually stunning and vast in scope, AC Origins has also been simplified to the point of being little more than an arcade walk through fantasy Egypt.

By contrast, think back to AC 2 or Brotherhood, wandering through the streets of Rome. You felt like you were there. Like every street corner held some new and interesting piece of history. Then, suddenly, you were engaged in a battle which you could not win. So you scaled a wall to escape, and felt the tension as stones or arrows rained down around you. Should you jump from that building? Run? Hide? Turn and fight? That is how it was in the beginning. That is not how it is with AC Origins.

AC Origins is a button mashing fest. Unlike earlier AC games, this one strips away the tension and the feeling of accomplishment when you are finally able to acquire that new piece of coveted gear or build up the villa or hideout with new art or refurbished buildings. In AC Origins, you just run around during a confusing quest (okay, I get it, there is something about your son and some people who you know so little about and have little tie to the main story line and some baddies who we know little about because they took over your country or something like that and so on), killing people and getting revenge for every Tom, Sam and Harry you find. Gear is pretty meaningless. Upgrading is meaningless, other than you cause more damage bubbles to appear above your enemy when you hit them in your arcade-like fashion.
Not much of an origin story if you ask me.

Then there is Aya. Aya is like Pontus. I just don't want to play as Pontus... I mean Aya. She is so unlikable as a character. I mean annoying to a fault. Cold, shallow, even downright mean. She could have been so much better. So much more likable. Why do we not get more of her story in the beginning? Could we see her descent into coldness, if we must go that path? Or are we just to assume "something bad" happened to her and now she is just this caricature of the stereotypical revenge tale? She was absolutely awful.

As for Bayek? He was cool. But again, not fleshed out to his entire potential. By contrast, think of Ezio - we knew Ezio. We knew his family. We knew why he did what he did. He was a true hero and fun to play. Bayek? Well, he would be fun to hang out with, but otherwise he is also kind of a shallow character who we do not know a whole lot about. Except his son. Who we also do not get a lot of backstory on other than... baddies (sorry, don't want to give out any spoilers). And I mean, he does good for the people. But why, other than gods and country? He is almost - almost - a Mary Sue, were it not for the fact that I died so many times before leveling him up. Anyway...

Now for my last point, and this is one that is very important to me because it can really add a lot to the immersion - the music. What gives with this garbage? I mean, there is so much a composer can do with Middle Eastern or even "fantasy" Egyptian music. But we end up with this techno-down tempo-ambient mess, with the occasional duduk thrown into the background for a few notes of Mid-East flair? Really? I know a lot of games are trending that way these days with the music. But come on - what a missed opportunity here. I could go on, but I will just end this here.

TL;DR - Game is visually beautiful but otherwise utterly simplistic in story, game play and character development. Villains are wooden and hollow, to the point of being little more than straw men. Music is forgettable and mismatched. Ubisoft would do well to return to the AC 2/Brotherhood formula of historical immersion and character development, as well as better story writing. Overall - Two out of Five stars, and reluctantly down voted. Only buy this one if you are an AC story completionist.

If you love the ancient egypt and enjoy being the friendly assassin next door. This is your game to play.
I have played more than half of all Assassins Creed Games and at this point i have to say, that AC Origin is prob the best part of the AC series. As the name reveals this game gonna take you back to the roots of the assassins and reveal how everything began.
In this series particular, there have been added a few new features such as taming wild animals. The localities are really beautiful, you get the opportunity to explore the old pyramids, the modern developed city Alexandria and much more. Overall i have made an enjoyable experience with this game. The DLC the curse of pharaos is pretty awesome as well and i can only recommend you to get it aswell

Good game but the performance can be better, 7/10 experience.

Using a GTX 1050 Ti and an i7 7700HQ on 1080p with tuned settings grants me an overall 45 FPS on the wilderness but it will dip into 30 or less in a heavy populated area which is good because its over 30, but could be better if it can be optimized to run 60 fps with tuned settings.

One bugs that still havent been optimized is sometimes NPC wont load its high res mesh resulting in faceless low poly NPC.

And if Ubisoft can remove the Denuvo DRM ( its cracked anyway ) or upgrade the denuvo version ( to prevent future version cracks ) it will be amazing for legal game buyer

You got to see Julius Caesar getting stabbed in the penis, totally worth playing.
My first AC game and ive heard that they shifted in the game design formula quite a bit from the previous products. It definitely was a quite unique experience with the playstyle, good balance between stealth and raw action combat, very large list of weaponry and types, if you can play at its full graphics, it is very recommended, was not the case for me since it slowed my pc quite a bit, the landscape is breathtaking but imo with that landscape in comparison the character models where managed very poorly totally two different qualities.
The plot is ok, its not something that will blow your mind or surprise you, cant comment on the Egyptian culture in it and its authenticity cause I dont understand it.
Since its an open world ive got say that moving around the map is very efficient, the game has way too many fast travel check points and it has also a auto-track system that was very convenient. Good or not I think it is up to the individual.
The game gets on sale quite often, I recommend to buy the golden edition under sale for the two major expansions.

It is a really good game, it is really witcher like, so if you love witcher youve gotta love this,the combat is good and compareable to dark souls, so this game has great gameplay, it is at the moment kind of buggy so expect some bugs but without that it is a really good game I really recommend it

Don't get me wrong - the game is fine but only for the AC' newcomers who haven't played any of the previous games in AC franchise.
Since I'm a fan of AC I was pretty much upset with Origins.I just post what I liked and what I disliked below

+ nice graphics
+ attention to details (the game world is living a pretty much realistic life, npcs don't look like dummies, they act like actual human beings)
+ cool hallucinations during the desert stroll

well that's it. now for the cons:
- poor optimization
- gameplay is really boring. you only need to find and to kill. that's all. (do you remember the fast paced chasing on carriage with Leonardo in AC II? or how you ram a huge galleon with your small ship in AC III? drunk fights in pubs in AC IV? yes? forget it.)
- story is not so good or its just me had too high expectations on it
- its too easy. Yes, the game has difficult settings for the first time in franchise but it impacts only on taken damage and given damage. The game itself is way too easy. With your eagle you can scout the whole enemy area and highlight every single enemy, see them through the walls on great distance, there is too much of control over situation thus your risks of losing are close to zero. That is not interesting, there is no thrill, no thinking, no planning like it was in previous games.
- what I really cared about is what happens in real world, in the present. I liked playing as Desmond in first three series of AC, I liked walking around Abstergo as it was in AC IV and Rogue. That part in Origins is too short.
- all these stupid RPG elements I don't like since Unity and they are here too.

For the first time in my life I finished an AC game under 100%. The first games I've finished on 100% cuz I really enjoy them, the rewards for collecting collectibles were worth it. While in Origins I close and delete the game the moment I passed the Credits part. ♥♥♥♥ Ubisoft. Since Unity all they care about is profit. All these deluxe/gold/ultimate editions and season passes, dlcs - thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it's not the way a decent game should be.

Edit* Since upgrading Windows 10 to the Fall Creators update and the recent game update I have experienced 0 crashes after playing a solid 4 hours straight.

Good:
-great gameplay and combat
1. Everything feels smooth and is fun to play.
2. The switch to a semi-RPG with a skill tree, loot, and equipment is honestly a great thing in my opinion. It still feels like Assassin's Creed too which is impressive.
-fantastic graphics
-fun missions and quests
1. Even now 18 hours in I am still finding new mission types and engaging side-quests.
-massive world
-above average campaign
1. It wont blow your mind but its better than most campaigns of recent AAA video games. Also I don't think I'm even
halfway done at 18 hours in so its fairly lengthy, but I am taking my time doing everything.
2. As mentioned above, the side quests are fun and really help flesh out the story of the land of Egypt.

Bad:
-graphics settings dont scale well and your CPU can spike randomly
1. On a GTX 1070 and Ryzen 5 1600 overclocked @ 3.7Ghz, I cannot hit 60 fps even on medium. I can hit 55-57 anywhere from medium to very high. 57 was the max FPS I got even after customizing settings for probably an hour (personally I refuse to put anything lower than medium). I literally only saw an increase of 1-2 fps going from very high settings to medium. I havent been monitoring my CPU but many people say that the game does randomly spike their CPU useage way up, so I will make note of that here.

-bugs and glitches
1. I honestly haven't encountered any memorable bugs or glitches, but I do know some people have had bugs that fail their missions and make them re-do them so I will leave this as a bad part of the game.

-crashes
1. I have experienced my fair share of crashes in the game.

-microtransactions
1. They do have a store where you can buy xp boosts and cosmetic items and even weapons. However, you can get weapons of equal value fairly easily in the game so I would not call it pay to win. Still, I do not support full price games having microtransactions so this is bad to me.

I still highly recommend this. I was in a game rut before this where nothing I played interested me. I was bored of playing video games until I decided to give this a try. It grabbed me right away, and I intend to try and 100% it.

As a huge Assassin's Creed fan, I'm one of the few people that not only have played almost every single entry multiple times, but I would even say Syndicate was my #3 or #2 favorite entry, so with that in mind, I'll say I liked this game but with some problems:

-I like that they changed up the gameplay & the combat dramatically, but I do miss having your fighting/attacks lock onto an opponent. This is more free swinging like Skyrim or Dark Souls. I guess there's nothing wrong with it, but I wasn't in the group of people that was clamoring for change to the gameplay.

-The map is too big. If it was only half the size with half the quests, it would still be absolutely huge. It's nice to say "Look at how big of a map we can make" but ultimately, you're doing the same things over & over in each area just with different level of enemies.

-The story started out great, but by the end, it started to feel like fan fiction of previous Assassin's Creed games. I recall at one point the bad guys were reciting Haytham Kenway lines & it was really cheesy. The concept of the targets/bosses being based off of Egyptian gods (The Ram, The Hyena, The Scarab, The Jackal, etc) was cool, but half of them really had no involvement in anything that would really catch anyone's attention or weren't given any real development or purpose (The Crocodile wasn't given a single word of dialogue until their death scene). That being said, while I did enjoy the twists & the overall story, I would say it was one of the weaker entries along side the stories of Revelations or Unity. I probably also got fatigued with the game for how utterly long & big it is. The thing with these Assassins Creed games is the stories usually involve loss of family members (brothers/father, mother, wife, father/father figure, father, son), I'd like to see something different there.

I'm pretty fatigued from the game after 60-70 hours, and it's pretty disappointing that Oddysey looks exactly the same as this game, so much that it's basically an expansion or season pass with more of the same. I'd like to see more innovation, smaller maps, more focused stories, the return of Brotherhood/allies, less story/twists involving family. I'd also like another game from the Templars perspective like Rogue & would rather they go farther into the future than deeper in the past.

a true comeback for the franchises
(noted : haven't finished the game yet.but i have to encourage people to trust in this franchise again!)

pros
+ rpg element (leveling,crafting,skill tree,(tons of)side quests)
+ stunning environment , atmosphere and gorgeous graphic
+ variety of quests
+ good quest design
+ difficulty (finally)
+ has some influence from the witcher 3 (in the good ways,of course)

cons
- some annoying bugs and glitches here and there
- the new combet system takes time to get used to

TL;DR: buy for exploration of Eqypt, don't buy for mediocre gameplay and story.

Good game. It is absolutely fantastic being able to explore a recreation of Ptolemaic Egypt seeing the Library of Alexandria and the Giza Pyramids and Sphinx. The game is worth it for that reason alone in my opinion.

The gameplay is solid too although I wish the game did not require you to kill so many animals to level up gear. This is something I do not like doing in games. Gameplay gets REALLY boring and repetitive after about 25 hours, at which point I hadn't even explored half of the map.

The story is whatever. They throw you into the Ptolemaic part of the story pretty quickly without giving you really any background as to what is going on or about the current political climate. The modern day parts of the game are pretty pointless too. I actually started skipping dialogue about 50 hours in and I don't think I've ever done that in a game before.

The discovery tours are amazing. Narrated tours of the history of some parts of ancient Egypt make buying this worth it on its own.

Been a bit hesitant whether I wanted to play more of Assassin's Creed, to be honest. Origins feels a bit different though. Has some RPG elements with an open world. I wish I could pick the dialogues too, but it is AC, not the Witcher. Anyhow, if you're willing to pay $30-60 for a game that comes out every year, you're not going be disappointed actually. Game is perfectly optimized and runs great on my GTX 1070. The story seems promising as I'm looking forward to put more hours into this game.

No other game can take you back to ancient egypt like Origins does.

Pros:
> Amazing graphics, maxed out at 60fps with GTX 1060 6GB
> Fantastic fighting mechanics, you'll have to actually think and plan
> Massive, playable map with varying biomes and terrain (lots more than you'd think)
> Interesting story

Cons:
> Uplay
> The game still has it's fair share of aggravating bugs (nothing game-breaking)

This game is really great for those who enjoy vast open-world RPGs and not necessarily the AC franchise. It seems that the series took a turn from mere stealth focus to a more Witcher-like experience that focuses on building your character and much more diverse sidequests aside from the main storyline. Hadn't played the games since Black Flag and decided to gave Unity a try. It was really disappointing for many reasons so I kind of gave up on the series. Then I tried Origins about a month after it came out and it was definitely worth it.

- Really nice combat system that doesn't rely on counter attacks. You actually need to dodge.
- Great visuals
- A huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ world to explore
- Plenty of sidequests, locations to complete
- Many customization options (bows, swords, axes, spears, outfits, mounts etc.)
- Storyline's not too bad
- Cool soundtrack

I thought it was a pretty cool game. It's not a must play or anything but it would be okay to buy it on sales if you're a fan of the older AC games. I'm glad Ubisoft took their time and came up with something good this time.

I've seen quite a few reviews here saying that the game's performance is terrible and that crashing and bottlenecking is frequent but in my experiance the game runs at a stable 60 FPS (capped) on high/very high settings with no crashing or freezing so far.

I don't even know where to start with this review. The last time I was this charmed and blown away by a game was when I played The Witcher 3, and that should say something. Seriously, it doesn't even matter if you care about the AC franchise or not - if you are someone who wants immersion, ambience, detailed environments, an incredible soundtrack and a solid story then you should try this and not even think twice about it. Combat may take some getting used to but seriously, that should not stop you from dipping into this experience. This is one of those games that stops you in your tracks; you just want to stand still, take your 33939262th screenie, and marvel at the entire picture in front of you. 10/10, I can't recommend it enough.

Sidenote: I studied Egyptian Language and Culture at uni, and I 100% approve of the historical accuracy in the environments I have been seeing (I'm leaving the story aside when I say that, it's obviously still a fictional game).

Edit, after 90+ hours and a completionist playthrough: I (mostly) stand by all of the above - ambiance in this game is second to none and I especially love the addition of endless stretches of desert, just for the sake of having them. The sole reason I can't give this game a 10/10, is because of the ending and rather thin writing on Ubisoft's end. The events happening are great, amazing even, but the way they transpire is in my opinion a bit poor. Though if you are a big Aya-fanboi, you will probably love it.

Overall, still a 9/10, and for me the GOTY.

Adding this in 2018: it's better than Odyssey ;)

Personal review & ratings:

Running a gtx 1080, i7-6700K and consistently manage to get 70-100+fps on ultra.

Personally this one of the best instalments I have made. Assassin's creed has come a long way and has taken influence from other games (such as far cry) and combined them. The map in this game is massive with a deep story of corrupt people and evil pharaohs. This is explored throughout the breath taking environment. The story of this game is fairly long but requires you to do side quest to level up and experience different missions or skill sets.

This is a really, really good game. It's weird to think the same company that made this also released "Assassin's Creed: Valhalla" and "Far Cry 6". Kinda doesn't really gel in my brain, but whatever.

I'll give you nine shiny dimes if you can guess the reason I'm NOT recommending the title, in my own small way very literally damaging its reputation on this website.

You're correct. Here are your dimes. UBISOFT CONNECT is an inherently cynical, brand-damaging blight on the whole legacy of the company. I know they have their reasons (lots and lots of shiny dimes), but I'll never condone or reward that kind of frankly shady, always-online commitment needed for a game I generously bought from them. No. ♥♥♥♥. That.

Great game, though. Really. No underhanded complements here, this is really one of the finest open world games I'm sure I've ever experienced.

Is it FAIR to put a great game on blast for the policies of the company that released it? If video games are an art (and they are, of course), my answer's no. The quality of that art should be able to stand irregardless.

it SHOULD, but it's not here. Not with me, I hope not ever. UBISOFT CONNECT is absolutely the second-worst always-online, memory-thieving DRM digital leash I've ever experienced. No shiny dimes for saying which gaming giant's was worse.

Great game, a hideous policy that honestly blights out all critical thoughts on the matter right now. It's disgusting. It makes you want to take a shower in sand.

OK, I'm actually in the middle of playing and I had to come post a review.
I'll do a quick pro/con, and then WHY I felt the need to write a review right away.

PROS:
-The graphics...are...AMAZING. I was actually moved a little watching the sun and god-rays rise up above the wind-swept dunes just to the south of Siwa. This is one of those games that makes you truly understand just how far graphics quality has come over the last decade and a half.

-The combat system is new and sometimes frustrating, but only because you really have to develop the skills to manipulate and time it well compared to the relative easy mastery of the other games. No more invincible assassin, but the new challenge is invigorating and interesting. (Also, it's not terrible, like Unity.)

-The world map so far is wonderfully interactive and exploration is rewarding and fun. As has been stated before, there are still plenty of points of interest and enjoyment, but not the wild "icon spam" seen in past games.

-The main character, Bayek, has a deeply interesting personality and a far more genuine personal story than some of the previous assassins we've come across. He harkens back to the depth of feeling and humanity we saw in both Ezio and Edward Kenway.

CONS:

-There are a few pathing issues with some of the AI, and when you need to follow someone they will occassionally get stuck on a wall or something. I found the issue to be correctable with a good ramming with my camel. Also, AI will be reported as being in one place when tracked by Senu, then suddely shoot 300 feet in another direction and stay there.

-AUDIO ISSUES. By far the only truly annoying con so far. Certain aspects of the audio cut out completely when used with my LOGITECH audio equipment on 5.1 surround. Can't hear character footsteps, dialogue (Good thing I had subs enabled when I started it) water or ambient noises. COULD hear combat noises, character "white noise" (when he grunts while climbing etc.) and loot noises. SELECT dialogue would come through. Fine when used with my plug-in speakers, only affected headset.

-CPU usage is VERY high. I have an Intel 4790k at 3.6 with an overclock to 4.1 with a Corsair H105 closed-loop liquid cooling system. Still running at 75-80% non-stop. Kinda nuts. Shouldn't be seeing quite so much CPU usage when I am running a GTX 1080 TI with 11Gb of memory and 32 Gb of RAM, I feel. But the game runs smooth at 75-90 frames per second on 4K with a 160hz refresh rate, so I'm not really complaining.

------------------------------OK, to the meat of why I was SO EAGER to recommend this game---------------------------
It's as simple as this:

Got a poison weapon.
Ran to the middle of the street.
Hacked down some soldiers guarding a transport of Iron.
REALLLLY busy street, lots of people.
Some of the soldiers get poisoned.
Put bodies in a neat circle in the middle of the street. (Because morbid pictures)
The local citizenry start walking over the bodies and getting sick.
Suddenly, sickness is everywhere.
Foot traffic begins puking and dying by the dozens.
More poisoning happens.
Farmers and marketeers closest to the road are dropping like flies.
Vomit everywhere.
10 minutes later, easily over 150 bodies all up and down the road.
MFW it's spreading like a highly virulent disease.
MFW I started the bubonic plague on a street in Siwa.

Get the World Health Organization in here because people are STILL dying all around me, it's spread all along the road and it keeps getting worse. Bodies have dissapeared and people are still sick and dying and making more bodies.

11/10 would poison the entire highway again.

*** DO NOT BUY THIS GAME I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT IN IT'S CURRENT STATE ***

I cant possibly give this game a good review, after the 16 hours on record that I have, 15 1/2 of those hours were spent trying to grit through the 100% CPU usage, before I finally gave in and decided frying my CPU was not worth playing the game.

My system is as Follows:

I7 4790K 4GHz
GTX 1060 3G
16G of Ram

Well within the Recommended system requirements for this game.

Every other game that has been released in the last month, runs amazing, ultra settings, no problems. This game is the only game that runs like crap on my PC, and why is that? The only thing I can think of is the protections they've put on the game for pirating. It's a joke honestly Ubisoft, I hope someone opens a class action lawsuit on this game, false advertising for recommended system specs, sign me up if that happens.

Pretty good and the first assassin's creed game I actually enjoy. Great setting/world design, solid combat and an interesting story. Sadly it has some flaws that seem to be in most big games in recent history.
- huge world with a lot of repetitive side quests that are annoying after a while
- random loot
- "grindy" hunting + crafting
(this is really just a slog - get 20 of this and 25 of that and 18 of this to boost your dmg, health whatever by a X%) It is lame, annoying and time consuming.
- buggy
- mediocre performance
- daily missions
- ingame shop to save time in a 60€ game ffs
- level based. there are games where this works, but in this one it is just completely dumb that the hippo on the right side of the river is easily killable and the one on the left tanks 150 hits. enemys are not reasonably stronger they just do more damage and have a lot more hp based on the level. => lame, annoying and not creative in the slightest.
I like the game I really do, but I am not sure whether I will get close to finishing it or just stop playing soon like I did with Nioh.
More playtime, bigger world, random loot and crafting grind = better ? Sadly this trend seems to be in most games.
Quantity over quality !
I am not saying that the game has no details, just that you would embrace these a lot more with handplaced loot and less side missions that are not as repetitive. Crafting is not bad in all games, but in this game it utterly terrible. A useless annoying feature. Same with the levels: make enemys more vigilant, faster, just more, better acccurary... Idk, but this is lazy ♥♥♥♥.
A solid game with some really annoying flaws and an ingame shop that basicly indicates "don't want to grind ? spend money". For me these flaws are so significant that I can't recommend this game for the full price. Buy it for 10-20€ if you want to pass some time. It could have been great.

AC Origins is pleasure to watch, it's incredibly beautiful and sometimes I just walk around to look at the details of a temple or a cave. However, I never play for very long a time, because it's actually boring. It's based on a series of small quests, with no underlying story keeping the player hooked up. Some quests are very boring, like one that consists in finding a dude's children who are playing in the temple and got lost......
I recently played Tomb Rider (2013 game) which was way more addictive because I had a clear goal since the beginning: escaping the island. And a lot of things happened trying to prevent that from happening. In AC Origins, this kind of addiction is not there, and I am playing it to enjoy the beautiful show... I recommend it on sale, for its visual content.
One more thing about AC Origins, it's damn intense on the hard drive !! I don't understand that: the hdd light is always on, loading content like in real-time !! Why not using the RAM instead of being so intense on the HDD, causing some lags in the game, despite a CPU and GPU .... Other AAA games don't behave like that, with comparable graphics.
The last horror thing is uplay... getting blocked for no reasons, etc... ubisoft should fire the team responsible for that software. And the buyers should go to similar games developed by other companies...

Good opening to the new generation of Assassion’s Creed series despite the questionable non-assassin vibes

For the price you pay you get a grand virtual history tour of Ptolemaic Egypt in ~40 BC with up to 50-ish or more hours of contents.
where else can you find anything like this?

– 9.5/10 (Exceptional)

Pros
- Revamped RPG-ish combat is challenging and rewarding
- Gorgeous graphics
- Great soundtrack
- Beautiful Egyptian environment
- Interesting story

Cons
- Lacking cool iconic counterattacks seen in previous games
- Less and less stealth assassin feel replacing with more straight-up fights and mythical monster fights

The game is truely gorgeous! Ubisoft really did a great job one this one recreating acient Egypt's scenery and culture, as well as Greek and Roman's in that period. Map size is enormous, vast, full of life and that added that value to the game in exploring aspect. I've been enjoying it so far, it is one of the game that I really enjoy both story and gameplay. Also, it is a plus if you are old school fan for the series who has played the first games, it tells the story about the first assassins and their creed which then links to AC 1 and 2 lore.

Although there are lots of changes for old fans, there are more RPG-like elements such as character and quests level system. Most EXP comes from doing quests, and it's almost impossible to continue the main quests if you are underleveled. I feel like these changes are not bad at all since the game is meant to be a fairly long open world game that players should spend time exploring it.

i like this game, i really do. but at this point in time I was considering to not recommend it. Which is really sad for me actually. The gameplay is good. Story is good. Environment and graphics are amazing. But you will see my point in the following paragraph. Here is my full take on Assassin's Creed Origins. Enjoy...

It takes some getting used to the new combat style, and after the frustrating learning curve it gets a lot better, i still prefer to stick to stealth and archery though. I liked the previous combat style. Thats one of my only gripes with this game. the one other being the free running aspect seems to have gotten more buggy and unresponsive. But, My biggest issue though, is the constant crashing. i dont have a monster computer by any means, it was a powerhouse a few years ago and has now fallen into the slightly above average range. I have the EXACT recommended specs of this game, not the required, the recommended. Yet i still have consistent crashing every 20-40 minutes. I have been able to play for up to an hour and a half straight before but it is pretty rare. I believe it has something to do with a memory problem. i am planning to upgrade my graphics card and ram so i will update if the issue still persists. if it does not then they should really change the recommended specs to something higher than 8 gigs of ram. This game and immersion breaking issue is the reason why I wouldnt recommend it, but i am going to due to the other amazing aspects that make up for the big flaws.

Im a big fan of egyptian lore and mythology and have been since i was a child, and ubisoft does a really good job of immersing you in the world. You are sort of forced into partaking in side quests in order to continue in the main questline. Which i found to be tedious at first, but after getting into a few quests I have found that i thoroughly enjoy the stories and characters in the sidequests. the world is well thought out and is very fleshed out as well. The impact Bayek makes is very noticeable and I really appreciate his character. usually the good guy feels cheesy and forced but in this story it is very natural and I really love how Bayek is a very considerate person who doesnt ask for a thing in return and only cares for the people of Egypt above all else. Even the side quests have emotion and make you feel impacted by the world and the suffering or happiness of certain people and events. The main story is compelling and decently detailed, I do care for the characters and plot, but when you are trying to do some very important thing and end up getting side tracked for literal hours to level your character to progress the story it does kind of fragment and derail the story, pulling you out of it a bit.

I actually find the hunting and resource collecting to be rather fun, even if it is a bit repetitive. Upgrading gear for minor aesthetic changes and increased capability is decently rewarding (im big on aesthetics and being able to modify the looks as you upgrade. the little details make the difference for me). Seeing your work pay off with a slightly upgraded look to the wrist guard or quiver really keeps things fresh and motivates you to spend some time upgrading when you begin to have trouble in combat.

The graphics, are wow. Not much needs to be said, its incredible to say the least, I even tried on the lowest setting to see how it looked and it still looks amazing. They have done an excellent job of bringing Egypt to life. The massive great pyramids covered in white stone and adorned with golden points. Surrounded by a vast and desolate desert. Dune after dune with small rocky outcroppings hiding a cave or camp or a lost temple. The beautiful nile and its rivers jutting deep into the land. The way the farms and cities surround the water ways. When you are at a high vantage point and you can see nothing but dead desert in the distance but the nile is extremely lush and fertile and filled with green and life. Walking the egyptian streets of memphis and their clay houses and ancient temples, or riding on horseback through the streets of the roman themed alexandria with the iconic white pillars and roman styled structures. Simply amazing, a lot of time and effort went into making this and it should defintiely be noted.

Overall the game is great, other than my stagnation to the new combat system and the crashing i mentioned, this game is absolutely phenominal. The story and environment are the best in the series. Oddly enough, it wont be one to stay in my library forever. Its fun to play and left a decent impact but im not obsessed with it in any way like i have been with other games (TES series, the witcher seriesl, etc...). So, even with all the good this game offers, its also pretty bummy to have to deal with sometimes. despite the really irritating crashes, I am going to recommend this. even if your game crashes every 40 minutes, you should definitely give it a go just for the experience, endure the annoyance, its worth it. I guess that would be my full breakdown, Thanks for listening!

Excellent new entry in the series. Its a bit simpler than the previous games, focusing almost exclusively on sneaking around and killing (but is MUCH more forgiving when you fail at sneaking). To make that more interesting the game also goes full RPG and adds a level and loot system as well as an ability tree. As someone who quit the series after Black Flag this was an excellent point to jump back in and I had a very good time with it. It also runs excellent and had no technical issues that I could see.

The new AI/Combat system could use a bit more polishing, and for some reason they ditched the awesome free running/parkour system from Syndicate, in favor of the older style from Black Flag.

Other than those few drawbacks, it's one of the best games in the series and will keep you entertained for hours.

I played it only briefly so far, but my first impressions for this game are positive. I played every single main Assassin's Creed game on console and this is my first true pc experience with an Assassin's Creed game. I bought the Gold Edition on release and so far it looks promising.

However I am tampered with some audio glitches and occasional stutters (even with a GTX 1080Ti) on my second startup. Usuallly restarting the game makes things better for me.

My first impression of this game is that it feels very different from the older Assassin's Creed games. There is no more minimap, in favor of a Skyrim-like location bar at the top of the screen. There are tons and tons of quests and this is the first open world from Ubisoft which doesn't feel blatantly shallow and empty to me. There are loads of things to do and see and makes the game even more wonderful. The new RPG-like combat system takes some getting used to, but feels like a nice change of pace from the usual combat systems this game series has seen so far. And the soundtrack... the soundtrack is truly incredible. The only things that may put some people off is the grind. There is quite a bit of grinding to do in order to get better weapons and fight higher level enemies than you. But after all, they switched Assassin's Creed to an RPG more than ever now.

If you're a fan of the series and you'd like to see the foundations of the Brotherhood and the early connections to the First Civilization, full with temple-like puzzles from AC2 to exploring a huge beautiful open world full of content and customize your character to your heart's content, this game is for you.

+ Bayek is a good lead
+ Story is decent, it also has some intresting plot twist
+ Modern day story is back with new protagonist not just 8 minute cutscene or less
+ one of the video games that has beautiful graphics when this review is made, and also has many settings on the graphic settings with preview of how they will look in-game
+ Realistic animation, especially NPCs animation looks fluid and lively. I still prefer syndicate/unity's animation for parkouring though
+ It has a better sidequest system than the previous game
+ The Hidden Ones and The Curse of Pharaoh dlc is pretty good

+- In the first half of the game, the story is basically "Revenge Of The Last Medjay". However, the narrative will improve as you progress the game
+- Aya character is sometimes out of place. Her son is dead but Bayek drowned in sorrow about it, usually a mother would feel more sad when her children died.
+- I could achieve 60fps but only on deserts area, in cities especially Memphis my fps would drop to 28-50s fps. sometimes this game felt choppy in the cities but it can be easily fixed by limiting the fps to 30 (honestly this game worth to be played on 60 fps).

- One of the most demanding games to date, i need to buy a new CPU cooler because this game just about to fry my processor. DO NOT EVEN HOPE TO PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU ONLY HAVE PROCESSOR WITH ONLY 2 COREs.
- The devs is more focused on the historical element than the actual lore of Assassin's Creed
- No Codex (WTF??)

I haven't liked the Assassin's Creed games for a long while now, but this one has brought me back. I love how smooth running up and down walls is without having to hold down a button to do so. Feels far better than any previous game. I run this with a GTX 980 on the highest settings with no frame issues. Don't know what other problems people are having, but none of them have yet to occur for me. It runs great, it feels great and I am very happy with it.

Honestly Ubisoft is one of the most annoying companies if not the most, trying to force you with a garbage program "Ubisoft Connect" that doesn't allow me to play the game ( I OWN ) because poor souls can't authenticate my ownership via U-Connect... what a joke honestly, I wish if people gather around & agree to not pay a cent to there outrageous policies...

Time to spit some facts!

This game is amazing, quite literally amazing. From the start of your adventure things start off with a bang and you are presented with a tense fight and some temple exploring (post fight). To me, this sets the scene perfectly and gives you everything you need to know about the atmosphere and incredible graphics the game presents.

Once finishing the "tutorial" and established an understanding for mechanics you are off to the races with "!" markers, now to a seasoned vet like myself for management in games like this it was very easy and not difficult at all. Some advice from me "keep going" treat each area as a story, learn what is going on and take your time doing everything in an area before moving on (unless it is high level).

If you go in with an open mind and really allow yourself to be immersed in this amazing world you will have a blast, in 2020 the game still looks great.

Happy hunting and do not for a second think "oh just another Assassins Creed game" this is different!

After putting in a few hours, this game has exceeded my expectations and disproven my worries. The game is fresh and just what the series needed after lots of the AC games suffered from repetition and overall just being rushed out.

Taking part in ancient egypt, the game takes you back to the start of the creed and you take the role of Bayek, Medjay of Siwa. Along with this revamp in story, the game has also been changed for the better in areas such as combat, which feels fresh and like it actually takes skill and thought in comparison to old games, where the concept was to spam the attack button, with it being more in-depth due to new variations of weapons and abilities that we can play around with.

For the first time since Black Flag, i have felt like i actually care for the characters due to inclusions of more backstory containing details of their life and struggles. Furthermore, though i am not near finishing the story, it has kept me gripped and interested and i feel as if the year off for the team has really gone far in the development of the story and characters.

In conclusion i think that this will go down as one of if not the best AC games made, and for anybody contemplating their purchase, i strongly recommend it. 9/10

Extremely repetitive...

It's really fun for a bit, but the game is way too easy which makes it boring quickly. The story is also quite predictable.
The setting is cool and the locations are interesting, but it really doesn't make up for the lack of quality content. This game is prime example of quantity over quality.

A wonderful game, just like any other of the games in the Assassin's Creed series!

However, It has alot of problems.
First of all, this game contains micro transactions. Something all gamers should stay far away from.
The game is also broken in multiple ways, for example, Surround Sound is completely broken and some very unlucky people are even having issues hearing dialogues at all in the game.
This feels like another money grab from Ubisoft.

Another thing thats also very dissapointing, is how the recommended system requirements is so very wrong.
This game dosen't run stable at all on my higher-end pc, wich is way past those recommended system requirements.
My friend is also having the same issue on his rig.

TL;DR
The game contains Micro-transactions, is very poorly optimized and contains alot of bugs.
This feels like another money grab from Ubisoft.

I'd recommended everyone to stay away from this game until it goes on a sale, or a majority of these issues are solved.

The game itself is enjoyable, side quests are meaningful and rewarding to do and the new combat system is better than in previous assassin's creed games. The story had grabbed me and i wanted to see more and know what happens to the characters involved, but with the glowing praise i give the game i can't recommend it because of the poor performance of the game. Random frame rate drops litter the game, and it isn't an issue of turning down the graphics settings, that actually doesn't affect anything, i get the same frame rate on very high and on low settings. There are rumors of being 2 pieces of drm integrated into the game and is causing CPUs to run at 100% and thus cause performance issues and possibly damaging computer systems. So until Ubisoft removes these drm programs i am giving this game a negative review and highly recommend boycotting assassin's creed origins even if you are desiring to play it greatly, ubisoft needs to be shown they can't do this, wish i knew about this drm crap before i bought it.

When I was at school, we had a chapter on Egyptian Mythology, it's culture, traditions and stuffs and I used to skip that part, pertaining to the fact of how weak I was in History! Now, after playing Origins for 100+ hours, experiencing every bit of its journey, I can now understand, what those Pyraminds do or how mummification process works or about the livelihood of the people there! With breathtaking adventures across Egypt, getting to Relive the era and fighting with Gods, I mean...can't expect anything more from a game! Although, as a Asssassin's Creed game it fails to provide that Assassin feeling, getting more towards RPG elements, average side quests, unsatisfying combat and not so much of a sneaky ride...but still..the gameplay, huge arsenal and beautiful world with a nice touch of fighting Gods at the end and mummies, just a great value for the bucks!

Overall 8.5/10....Get it on Sale if your PC sucks...cause Optimization is not good..and Microtransactions, well..forget it..you don't need it.

Im writing this review from around act 2 with 44 Hours clocked in.

First of all, i've been an die hard AC fan since the very fist one, i completed all of the games on multiple platforms on 100%.

When i got this game, i was amazed. The amount of beauty in this game is astounding, the mechanics feel satisfying and really good to play with, the combat is completely revamped with added parrying, better dodging and actually manouvering around your enemy.

The game is filled with things to do, im 44 hours in and i still haven't even completed Act 2 because i get distracted with the amount of stuff you can do in this game. Side missions are broad and actually fun to do instead of them being a drag in other games. They actually make you feel like you're accomplashing something for the people.

Hunting feels great, the various amounts of bows and weapons really make hunting more effective against the various animals that are out there. Now when you kill the animal, like in previous games you will have some sort of crafting system, though this time you're actually upgrading your gear directly from your gear menu and it tells you how much its going to improve.

The story is great, it really brings back the old AC feel for me, like how i used to feel when i played the second game in the series, the Ezio trilogy were some of my most beloved games period. This game really makes me become addicted to AC once more.

The history in this game is breathtaking, from pyramids to mummies, to sphynx' to gigantic deserts. This game is packed full with it and it all looks just beautiful.

To keep it short: I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love this game and i recommend it to anyone who is either an AC fan or just a really big fan of history, as the amount of history in this is amazing.

I was not sure if I want to buy this game or wait for it to be cracked but I went for the purchase eventually.
I am not a big fan of the recent AC games, they got repetitive, the story got a bit confusing, the mechanics were the same and the must frustrating thing, ironically, was the fact that way too many time, my character climbed a wall when I didn't want him to, randomly jumped in a weird way off a building, stuff like that. And the combat got super easy, you just counter and oneshot or smoke bomb and oneshot. There was no real sense of progression.

ABOUT ORIGINS
The simplest way to describe this game: if Witcher, Farcry and AC had a child, this game will be it. And it's a pretty healthy and cute kid.

The game looks gorgeous and I really enjoy the gameplay aswell. I'm not deep into the story but so far I like it. The leveling system gives you a really good sense of progression, the map is big enough, you encounter a lot of different enemy types that require different tacticts and yes, you can still hidden blade one shot people (if your blade is good enough, more about that later).

COMBAT
If you played Witcher or Shadow of Mordor, the combat system will be familiar but with a very big difference. There is no hand holding when it comes to combat. There is not button that flashes when someone is about to hit you, so you can perfectly counter, dodging wont transform you into SSJ3 Goku and you can't hack and slash your way into any base like an invicible god just by smashing the attack button.

You know when you fight groups if enemies and you are attacking a dude in front of you and you want to switch to someone in the back that's a bit farther away and your character would make a mini leap right in front of him and start attacking? Witcher and Shadow of Mordor are perfect examples of that mechanic. That's not happening here though, if you switch targets and the second targer is 0.5 meters away from the edge of your blade, you will hit the air like a dummy.

This may a be a deal breaker for some but I personally like it. It gives another dimension to the combat system. You have to actualy position yourself in a good spot, block arrows with your shield, have priority targets, use specific weapons against specific enemies and so on. It makes the combat a bit harder, with a higher learning curve but when you end up learning how to properly fight it feels good to take down multiply enemies not because you are the main character but because you mechanically outplayed them.

The combat is also pretty smooth and satisfying. One thing I do not like though is the fact that characters seem to move oddly fast when they charge or when you raise your shield and move around. That may take you off of the emersion but it may be a personal thing idk.

Every weapon is different, they have different attack animations, attack speeds, some swords will make your enemies lose balance and expose their back for higher damage while other weapons will straight up hammer them to the ground.

You have power up attack which is different for every weapon type and a sort of "ultimate" ability that charges up when you fight which is also different for every weapon type. This allows you to really make up your own fighting style and it's pretty satisfying.

When it comes to bows, you again, have multiple types for different situation. You got long bows for long distances that have higher damage but fewer arrows, bows that fire multiple arrows in a row or bows that fire 5 arrows in a single shot for massive damage and so on. They are cool to use plus you can ride your horse/cammel while sitting backwards and fight enemies that are chasing you, like your in the next "Fast and Furious: Burnout Sand" movie.

GEAR "Do it for the loot!"

The rpg system really kicks in here and you have a pretty goot looting system. The outfit is cosmetic but you can upgrade your hidding blade for dmg, "bow glove" for dmg, quiver for more arrow, the other glove for meele dmg, chest thing for health and tool pack for more slots. You upgrade them with resources found all over the map, from killing crocodiles for skin to bandits for wood and other ♥♥♥♥. It has a really cool Farcry vibe.

You can upgrade low level weapons to your current level at the blacksmith. Weapons have different qualityes, from uncommon to legendary, each level up having more perks (like a legenday mace witch is alwasy on fire and you end up burning down everything around you, fun but maybe not for every situation).

GAMEPLAY
I wont talk much about the story since I'm not that far into it but so far its good. The sidequests however are way better than expected. They are legit witcher level sidequests. They have multiple parts, with multiple types of gameplay, from rescue to straight up assasinations and you also get plot twists and good mini stories. I found myself doing a lot of these not only to level up but also because they are good.

I'm playin on Hard dificulty and the enemies are actually hard to beat and it's a good challenge.

The movement got redesigned. It's a whooooole lot more responsive. You always run (there is not sprint button which may sound weird but it feels normal) and if you want to climb up you press a button, if you want to climb down, you press another. No more "aaaah no, no, don't climb that door for no reason, noo why would you jump there, no.. no that way.. "

If feels responsive and smooth. It's a similar to syndicate but more polished and way better than Shadow of Mordor. One thing that I never liked is how you can make every single jump and you always land perfectly on every single edge while sometimes your character literally flies in a really spiderman way to the next building. In Origins, if a jump looks a bit shaky then most likely you won't make it and that's a good thing. You feel more in control and aware of your surroundings.

PERFORMANCE
Yes, the 100% cpu thing is real. It happend to me in Alexandria. BUT I dropped to 40 fps while playing on ultra.
I have a 980ti, i7 4790k and 32ram. The game runs smooth 90% of the time and I'm hopping the fps drop will get patched out but for now it's not a deal breaker. I'm not sure how people with way better PC's than mine are experiencing constant 15fps like I saw in the reviews.

OVERALL
If you liked Witcher and previous AC games, you will like this one aswell. I think it's a really good direction, it still has that AC vibe but with a richer experience. I'm glad I bought it.

Despite the hate about the Denuvo and VM protect controversy surrounding this game, it still performs alright.
It's a fun game, lots of exploring and not as much hand-holding as in the earlier games.

+ Combat improved since the last games.
+ Massive open world
+ Bayek's character (really like him for some reason, he seems more human than the likes Ezio, Frye Twins and Arno.
+ Lots of things to do (No collectibles like in the earlier games, You do quests and get loot and XP.
+ Arena and Hippodrome (Two fun side activites if you are short for cash).
+ Music

- Microtransactions to make the game easier for you.
- Even playing on highest difficulty the game still isn't that hard...
- Some glitches and bugs, not like unity, a game meant to be buggy couldn't even be that bad :>

30 Hours in and I love the game at the moment, have heard people say that the story gets weak nearing the end, but haven't finished the main story yet so I'll have to wait and see.

Running a GTX 780, i5 4670k and 16 GB's of ram, haven't really encountered any big performance issues, some small FPS drops (drops of 5-10 fps in cities at times) but otherwise the game is running at 60 FPS or above, (keep in mind that I am playing on High settings, not ultra).

I don't usually write reviews, but I kind of felt obliged to. As a long time fan of the AC series, I have enjoyed the playstyle of the games. This game, however, is… different. I will note that this game was a gift, and I am happy and thankful for it; I don’t regret playing through this game.
As a game, not looking at it as part of Assassin’s Creed series, I have to say that it is a great game (hence the recommendation). But looking at it from the series perspective, I would have to say that it has disappointed me in the segments of gameplay I used to find very enjoyable in previous games.
(might be a few spoilers, I am not sure how far into the story you are)

First off PERFORMANCE
This game is demanding, ok? It demands all your attention and the attention of your gaming platform (PC or console). I must say… it is kind of worth it. So, unless you have recommended system requirements, or above, don’t expect this game to run perfectly. Sorry….

COMBAT
Next, I have to comment how the combat mechanics were dealt with. I admit that I am a huge fan counterattack, and only place where I was able to experience it were ship battles. Yes, it is true that Bayek can, in a way, counter attack, but it is a bit clunky, at least it was for me. Having to perfectly execute it (at times) made it a real annoyance because more often than not, I would miss because of my positioning. And that leads me to targeting system. You need to specifically mark your target, which I don’t mind; I mind the fact that if you do not mark it, your attacks will often miss, not be executed properly, or you will just run past your desired enemy. This is not the combat I am used in AC games; I liked previous system, which is a big reason why I liked the games so far.
(extra comment: Flavius fight is just… awful, very very annoying)

THE HIDDEN BLADE
Speaking of combat, I also need to point out the value of hidden blades in this game. I am used to being able to stealth kill, well, anyone and anything while exploring new areas. If you take your time to inspect your surroundings and execute a perfect stealth attack, you would have no problem in killing any enemy. But in this game… unless you max out the upgrades on your blade (once you finally get it), it will do unimpressive damage… It might kill weaker enemies, but brutes, commanders and captains will still need your additional attention.

LEVELS
Now this is one of the main aspects of the game I despise. Levels. I love AC series because you do not have to grind your way up a levelling tree. Don’t get me wrong, I like to do side quests, but off my own accord, not because I am missing 3 levels to continue with the main story arc. It felt very underwhelming to do no damage to an enemy, and he kills you in one or two swings. Never have I been denied the chance of exploration because of imaginary number above my enemies head (well, not in AC series at least). I am used to walls that tell me ‘hey, idiot, you are not supposed to enter this area yet’, but this was just too annoying; especially the phylakitai who were a constant thorn in my side while doing missions. One of those resistant enemies that can’t be assassinated just using the blade.

GRINDING
Not sure how I feel about this… Sometimes it felt fun looking for resources I needed for an upgrade, but it was also annoying to grind for certain items. And near the end of the game, I was just sick and tired of having to go around looking for what I needed for the last upgrade. Of course, level gringin included.

MOUNT
I don’t actually have anything negative to say about this. Mounts are nice and responsive, mounted combat is really fun, actually, and you can even loot mounted! (I had to get off of my high horse (or a camel) and get arrows myself, though). Another good feature is that you can set a mark you need/want to go to, and make your mount run to it! You still can’t just let it auto-run and go get a drink, because you could run into enemies (damn you random phylakitai!). But for the most part, you can just lay back and enjoy the sights!

ENVIRONMENT & EXPLORATION
Beautiful. That’s it. This game has an amazing sight; from deserts to lakes, to mountains, everything is stunning. They did a wonderful job, and exploring every region was a pure bliss. (also, you can enter people’s homes and break their pots)
Not to mention that it will take you some time to explore every nook and cranny, so completionists beware!

EAGLE VISION
It is… different… Mostly because you literary are using an eagle 0.0 Not sure how much I like it… mostly because I often miss a few enemies that ruin my stealth approach. Don’t get me wrong! I love Senu! Just not sure how much I like this process (Although, extra points for looking yourself auto-run from eagles perspective)

STORY
Ok, I admit, the story was amazing! It has a great story arc, and amazing side quests. (On my way to level myself up) I couldn’t stop searching for more side quests who just give more to the overall story. And I was really disappointed when some of those quests were for higher level… that is the only negative thing in this. Other than that, side quests are really engaging and, in a way, are a small story arcs in their own right.

BAYEK
Of course he deserves a category for himself. I really enjoyed the development of this character, and I must say that he has become one of my favourite game characters. Also, his voice actor is amazing, and I love his sincere responses to events in the game. (He has the sweetest laugh!)

AYA
No. Just… no. She is a very disappointing female character. I hated every moment I was forced to play as her. When she was first introduced, I had noting against her, she seemed like she could be an interesting character. But as the story progressed, so did she. In the wrong direction. As an assassin, I have nothing against her. She has her ideals that go well with the creed. But, since the main focus of this game is Bayek, I am watching her from his perspective. And from that perspective, she is very disappointing character in my eyes.
Also, I have spent all my points getting Bayek to be as deadly as he can, modifying his abilities to my playstyle, and having to play as her, a mediocre assassin compared to him, was a real disappointment. I lost the ability to change gear, lost all my upgrades, and was downgraded from gold/purple items, to blue… Dealt almost no damage, and was better off scurrying in the shadows than fighting (even against one opponent; I swear I have no idea how I got out of some of fights alive!).
As for the rest of the things I think of her and her story… I better not start, because there are so many things I did not like about her, I don’t know where to start. Thankfully, her parts were short and soon you were back to doing missions with Bayek.

~ OVERALL ~
I have to say that it is an interesting game. Not a true Assassin’s Creed game for me, but a good game in general. Has a nice story and setting. You get and eagle that follows you and harasses your enemies, you can tame a big cat, your horse has GPS, and you can watch Aya die first hand.
9/10

This game is a welcome return to the Assassins Creed franchise. The last few installments have been lacking compared to the earlier titles, in my opinion, but Origins has been superb. The story is rich and the characters are well built, defined and interesting.
As expected with AC titles, the graphics and scenery in this game is incredible. It looks almost perfect. And there is plenty of it for you to explore, as the map is extensive and there are no shortage of available missions/extras. Almost 50 hours in and I have still not completed the main storyline (although I am getting close), but even when I am I have a vast amount of side missions and exploring left.
There have been many reviews stating that people have had FPS and graphics issues with this game, but I have found the opposite. I did expect some issues, as the game defaults to Ultra settings (at least it did for me) but nothing to date aside from a cow that glitched from the sky. Also, YES there are things you can buy from the store, BUT they are not game changers, they are mostly cosmetic and you dont HAVE to buy them. I havent and I have no intention of doing.
All in all, glad I spent the money on this, its been well worth it!

I cannot recommend this game until they fix whatever is causing peoples processors to tank. There is absolutely 0 reason that this game should push your CPU usage to 90-100%, im not saying its whatever DRM they're using, but clearly something ridiculous is going on, there is absolutely 0 reason for this game to push my CPU into even the high 80s let alone 90s to 100, if a console can run this just fine than the problem clearly lies with ubisofts optimization of the game or some other issue that is specifically computer related. If this issue gets fixed I will change my review but as is I cant play this game without worrying about frying my cpu.

will wait to see if any optimization improvements release but yeah there is no way i can play this game at the temps it pushes my CPU too and the fact that it pushes them so far is a little ridiculous.

I would like to thank ADankPineApple for reminding me to post my specs.

Assassin's Creed Origins is a refreshing and beautiful new addition to the franchise. The graphics are stunning and there is so much to do and explore. Unlike the last few additions of Assassin's Creed, Ubisoft took their time on this one, and it clearly shows. The base game is huge, and with expansions soon to follow, you will be finding it hard to put this one down. If you are a fan of the Creed then this title is a must buy.

Really glad they took their time with this one. New combat system is refreshing and the story is enthralling. Even the sidequests are all story-driven with their own cutscenes.

Some people are calling it the best in the series and I can see why. Very happy with this release. Quality over quantity pays off, Ubisoft.

So I have never written a review on here before, but I feel obligated after listening to all of the bad reviews. I almost didn't buy the game at all because of all of the people who argue that they have elite computers that have to try too hard in order to play the game, or saying they couldn't play at all because of framerate, etc. I'll address some of the issues I have read, and then leave a more positive review at the bottom.

I'm pretty positive most of the people who argue that their computer is overpowered and should be able to easily run the game, have a computer greater than mine and I completed the game with relatively no issue. I did have a couple crashes, but I changed some things to keep my computer cooler and the crash rate plummeted. I rarely, if ever, had a frame rate issue. No, my settings are not maxed, because I don't need to boost my own ego and rate the game based on if my computer can play it on ultimate settings rather than the actual game itself. Most of the comments here that are negative, do say the game is great but they disliked something Ubisoft did. Ubisoft has virtually always screwed the customer somehow, but you knew that before you bought the game and if you really didn't like them you would have stopped buying Assassin's Creed way earlier in the franchise.

The next review I read was about having to rush to complete the community event. After the event became active, the players had a full week to get to the required level and complete the event. At no point at all did I rush through any part of the game, let alone the story, to achieve the level needed and complete the event in time. In fact, I have almost double the hours in the game as one of the posters who made this complain and took my time to complete literally everything. I have all of the achievments for Steam and all of the available ones compelted for the Ubisoft Club. I loved the game, the view, and the experience and I'm not understanding how anyone needed to rush when you were probably a quarter to half of the level requirement before the event came out because I even got the game late.

The last group of reviews I want to counter is the cost and the additional DLC. I did buy the Gold Version for the season pass and I'm not at all put off by the company offering additional resources for more money. Why? Because they are not at all necessary. There are outfits and weapons available, which you can easily get equal to or better versions of by actually playing the game or some of the free options Ubisoft offers. The resources offered are literally called "Time Savers" as in when you are too lazy to grind like in any other RPG and get the things you want, you pay for the easy way out. I admittedly did use one of these items with the free Helix points you start with and so there is no loss to me, only a little boost. I will admit the resources can be short if you don't prioritize what you're spending them on, but without spoiling parts of the gameplay I can't really go further into that. I guess that falls into the "feeling rushed" comment from earlier. If you actually want the items/upgrades it is very easy to simply work for them. Want vs Need. It's basic.

For the actual game, it is extremely large. There is nowhere within the map that you can't go; most buildings are open and you can climb virtually any mountain when walking to a destination. Some battle types were a little frustrating, but that was just a personal thing really and the game itself was great. The kill animations for all of the weapon types were awesome and well though out. You never end a battle just dropping a guy and walking away. There is a bow and weapon combo for everyone.

The story line was very intriuging and after doing a little research I found there was actually a lot of truth to it (as in most of the Assassin's Creed games) and I enjoyed running into a lot of the historical figures and handling the plot twists throughout the game. The game also has a unique way of starting the Brotherhood since this was suppose to preceed the other games.

TL:DR, Game good, reviews bad.

Guys, guys,.. be more righteous. This game is absolutely georgeous. Certainly there are some issues to polish, but on the other hand it can be lived with. I saw your problems about FPS dropes. GTX 1080 had about 11 FPS? WTF.. It isnt possible. I have got i7 8700K GTX1080ti RAM32GB and at resolution 1440p ULTRA ALL it is around 70-90 FPS all the time. Gsync hasnt to be set on. The game has dropped down to windows a few times but the last save is always at the last point of progress. This game is "must be". This and Witcher 3 are the best.

A bit dissapointed about the gameplay. Disappointment is merely an emotion. Emotions are merely the abstract fabrications of our consciousness. Our consciousness is merely the byproduct of sensory input. This game is neither good or bad as both are irrelevant concepts. The sheer acknowledgement of the meaningless of existence is freeing and actually helps me feel more up beat and positive on the inside

Awesome gameplay, which has been a standard for the series. Gather equipment throughout the game was fun till the end. The 'mini games' are okay. After 2-3 matches in one you start to feel bored, but thankfully you do not have to play them so often to progress.

Sadly the story is not as good. As the title says it is about the origins of the assassins, so you expect something epic and awesome. There are two moments during the game where you get that epic feeling. But the beginning feels like a cliché and the end leaves you with a "really?" on your lips.

Assassin's Creed® Origins, while definitely a must-buy, is not a "revitalization" of the series that everyone claims it is. I've liked all of the Assassin's Creed games to date and this simply furthers the franchise into great environments and time periods.

The game play is essentially the same as every previous entry, with the exception of a new combat system. The new combat was at first unlikable, but once I got used to it, I really liked it. Everyone seems to be praising the "RPG elements" and how this has revitalized the franchise. It appears however, that anyone will call anything an RPG these days.


Let me be clear: There are absolutely no RPG elements found in this game. You can purchase different weapons and different outfits just as any previous entry. The main difference with Origins, is that the mission structure is less linear. The game is open world and you can choose whether to engage in the main quests or side quests. Granted, side quests are better than in previous entries, where you would go around pick-pocketing others or doing small assassinations. Here, the side-quests are a little more involved.

Does that mean this is an improvement? Well no. Side-quests suffer from the Fallout 4 problem. "Go here, kill this. Go there, kill that". There's not a lot of variety and most of the side-quests are boring. The issue with this is that the game has an artificial level system. Once you get enough experience, you level up. But enemies have levels too, and many side-quests and main quests are restricted to you until you level up, simply because the enemies become almost impossible to beat until you reach their level. This means that in order to progress the story, you need to engage in a series of boring side quests to level up. In this regard, the game actually suffers because of its so lauded "RPG elements".

That being said, the story was engaging and the environments fascinating. The contrast between the Egyptian, Greek and Roman cities brings quite a bit visually to the game. Egypt itself also has a number of good looking environments, from rocky desert mountains, to sand dunes, to the marshy delta of the Nile. It's quite fun just to ride your horse from objective to objective, taking in the scenery. The game also does show you the origin of the Assassin's Brotherhood, as well as the Templars, but I found it all a bit rushed. The main focus of the story is the vendetta of Bayek (the main character) and the origin of the brotherhood takes a back-seat. The story itself was great, but it was hindered because of the leveling wall that kept getting put up. I was engaged enough to want to continue the story, and yet I couldn't because I had to do some lackluster side mission or five in order to get where I could progress.

Concerning some minor spoilers, I wasn't a fan of the way Caesar was treated in this game. He was quite out-of-character and was put in a position that he shouldn't belong in. I've also heard rumors of the next entry of the Assassin's Creed franchise going with a Medieval viking setting. While I would be interested, I would hope instead that it goes the route of continuing the evolution of the Assassins in ancient Rome, as this game seems to set up.

Origins has a few other features worth mentioning. Gladiator fights, while limited, are extremely fun, due to the new combat system. You can also engage in chariot races, though I never really got the hang of it. Some might find it fun, but I didn't invest enough time in it to get any good, so I wouldn't know. Origins also returns naval combat to the game, though it is limited to just a few story missions. It was fun to blast other ships with barrages of fire arrows and ram them, as opposed to shooting off cannons. Naval combat isn't nearly as in-depth as Black Flag or Rogue, but it is welcome for short segments and is just present in just the perfect amount.

So is the game worth a purchase? Besides its flaws, I still recommend it. As a fan of the franchise, I liked it just as well as all the previous ones. The so-called 'RPG elements" are annoying and hinder your progress, but overall I found the game enjoyable.

If I'd like to tell long story short, I'll say that game is really nice, total rate is 8/10. But to be honest, from first game of series only hidden balde, stealth-mode, hood and entire-game long dream to revenge have left.

If I'd like to tell every criterion one-by-one, I'll say that:
1) Graphics and entire game world 10/10
2) Big objects physics 9/10
3) Small objects physics 5/10
4) Did I really wanted to get through all game? 8/10
5) Main characher story, also other people stories 9/10
6) Did I really wanted to get 100% after completing main story? 2/10
7) Fighting and synthetic intelligence 5/10
8) In game and real life history matching 9/10

And now about all of that criterions:
1) Graphics and entire game world
Graphics are really awesome. No lags, no freezes and other stuff like that on ULTRA-preset. Really beautiful surroundings, animals, cities, deserts etc. And all of that is in really HUGE world. Can't even understand how had Ubisoft done that in 4 years.

2) Big objects physics
Big objects physics is well-made. I've got only one bug with horse in my 22-hours long game. Horse just became mad in one moment and flew away like in space.

3) Small objects physics
By small objects I mean clothes, touching etc. I've got like have of a million times, when some parts of my outfit went crazy and just started flying. Hands felt inside other bodies really often. And a lot, no, A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. Those things looks really ugly for me

4) Did I really wanted to get through all game?
Main quests were really interesting BUT (!!!) you sometimes you can't join main quest because your level is too low to do it, and you have to do secondary quests. And like half of the secondary quests were so boring, in which I had to get on other side of a map, kill 2 000 000 enemies, get one piece of bracelet, get back and understand, that I forgot to loot this piece from dead enemy. 12/10 of really interesting side quests.

5) Main character story, also other people stories
Despite of the fact, that we starts game without any info about main character, after completing entire game player understand all of things, that he haven't knew. That +1 point for level of interest of main quests.

6) Did I really wanted to get 100% after completing main story?
When you've done main quests and kill of the bandits, you won't play any more in AC:Origins because of boring side quests. You may just enter the game for like 30-40 mins, but after that you'll fall asleep.

7)Fighting and synthetic intelligence
Fighting system is retOrded. Definitely retOrded. You have to use only 3 buttons to kill everyone in that game. Awesome, interesting, alluringly. Fighting system is same retOrded as a synthetic intelligence. When you killed an enemy, no one of his (enemy's) friends will notice that. Also you may hide in 2 millimeter-tall grass and no one will see you.

8) In game and real life history matching
Really amazing Cleopatra's and Caesar's pictures. Cleopatra looks like real one (wanted to get some balls inside her for entire quests around her ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ). Also you may see that Caesar were killed in same way as same called salad was cut. Noice.

P.S.
I really like that game, with considering all of that bad sides. And yes, I'm not a big fan of open-world games, this game is 4th in that type of games. So don't appraise my review so hard.

A fresh take on the Assassin's Creed franchise. The game is great overall. The combat is tough to start with but, becomes super enjoyable once you learn it. The map is huge, but I wish some of the deserts were a little more populated with anything, even viewpoints would suffice but they're for the most part completely empty. I'd give the game a 9/10.

This is the best game ive ever played! There is so much to explore and so much to do in the game! Its such a big map too that you can spend hours just exploring if you whant. The best is that its not only land you can explore but also under whater and in caves and pyramides. Mabye the game is taking alot of time because you need to hunt for animals etc to upgrade your armoure but it can be fun to do that too! I dont care if it cost 50$+ its so worth it! The grapics and fighting system are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing i played 38 hour in 2 days. Defently buy this game! You wont regret it!!! Mad props developers!!!!

This game was great when until it does not start, I can not finish it and I have tried several fixes. This happened with AC:Odyssey but I was within the 48 hours grace period for a refund. This issue has been ongoing with several AC games and Ubisoft has done nothing to patch it. I used their support for another game breaking glitch and was not satisfied with the assistance.

I have such a love hate realtionship with this franchise, I love what Assassin's Creed is, but I hate what Ubisoft has been doing to it.

However I can tell you right now, this ones a real winner.

It almost seems like the blag flag team has completely read my mind and addressed almost everything I hated about the old AC games.

- No more 90's collectathon gameplay. Secrets are no longer just stamped on your minimap just waiting for you to pick it up. This game actually expects you to explore and look for these things on your own, with some items giving riddles that lead you on to possible sidequests. FINALLY

- The long awaited move away from the batman counter combat. It feels a little floaty, and it's not quite there yet, but it's such a huge leap in the right direction.

- Sidemissions are FINALLY induvidual and varied. THANK GOD.

There are some fps drops regardless of what settings your on. This game needs a CPU optimization patch, other than that it's still a beautiful open world with a lot to do. Honestly, for the most part, this game is really good mostly because it borrows heavily on the best from other popular games, but it's leaps and bounds better than what has been going on. I can only hope AC continues to go down this path.

Absolutely fantastic gameplay and ancient lore. The game has so much to offer, the content is very rich and takes a lot of time to discover it all.

Graphics are so vivid and incredible. It's really the most beautiful game i have played so far. Runs smoothly and is well optimised. You don't feel bored that easily and it seems to me that you have an infinite number of side quests to complete. In addition, there's plenty of items for a player to find, unlock or buy. Different horses, camels, chariots, outfits and of course weapons.

Soundtrack is great, I especially enjoy the one which plays when you are in a hostile area.

Honestly, I didn't find a single thing to complain about the Origins. Hands down, the perfect game for me and I would recommend it to every player.

Surprisingly good! Those 2 years break were perfect for Assassin's Creed. This game is so much fun, there always something to do and it doesn't feel repetitive, the map is huge and full of details and all the secondary missions are quite interesting, reminds me of The Witcher 3.
This is definitely one of the best AC games released to this date!

probably one of the worst optimised games i've ever played.

frame drops and stutters almost every few minutes, after you once get used to the stutters next comes the never ending grind, the levels and the usual ubisoft fetch-a-thon, go there, grab that, kill that and rinse and repeat to the point it just gets annoying. just watch a youtube playthrough.

Although it doesn't giving the old AC aura but there is a new work on the series. They changed the combat system which is i like more in AC Odyssey (much more like a RPG game), level and skills system also changed (there is a couple of skills which are already needed to had Bayek from start of the game) and etc. By the way i liked the game.

Ubisoft, for future reference, if the player is holding the button you designed to "climb down", then JUMPING is the last thing the character should do.

The game looks and feels amazing, however I either have major FPS drops and chugging or I have a ton of crashing. I do hope this gets patched.

Its been a while, but the game had been patched enough to make it through the story and to continue playing. Graphics are sadly, only beautiful during cutscenes and are otherwise a visual mess or blurred colours.

Problems aside, I do recommend this game as its gorgeous and a blast to play.

I don't like the RPG format for AC. It's absurd that I can kill the crocodile over here in 1 hit because it has a low number by its health bar but I have no chance of killing the crocodile over there because it has a high number by its health bar. In a fantasy setting I don't mind so much but in a historical setting like this it's just silly. Main plot is the usual political intrigue involving a who's who of famous people from the era, the side quests are pretty good; somebody at Ubi must have played the Witcher 3 and taken a few notes. It's not a terrible game by any means, just bloated and forced against its will to be an RPG.

AC:Origins GOTY

Edit: After 40+ hours I can honestly say I have not encountered any bugs or noticeable framerate drops or excessive cpu usage that others are reporting.

The game is rather fun with what feels like skyrim levels of side quests popping up.

Just finished the main story line at 53 hours with a lot more content to get through, considering the price tag for this game I can safely say it is worth every penny.


Overall I highly recommend this game.

Running on an i7-6700k, msi gtx 1080 and 16gb ram.

Just completed the first city. The story, graphics, gameplay, and sheer amount of things to do make the game very enjoyable. Cutscenes are full of emotion and I'm really liking the story so far and the side missions for the most part actually make you want to play them instead of previous title that just felt like busy work. The new combat system took me a little getting use to, I still draw a bow 1\10 times when trying to pull my sword out but the Ai is very forgiving most cases so I feel more comfortable with it now than a few hours ago. If I had to gripe about anything it would be that the game has shut off on me in the middle of a load screen once and before I used vsync at adaptive the cutscenes were wavy, but I take that as fine tuning. In all I'm loving my experience and recommend for any AC and/or open world fan. Can't wait to get back in and explore the other 95% of the world created here.

Product refunded

As of right now I can't recommend the game. I bought the gold edition due to it being on deep discount during the fall sale, but like some other reviewers have stated, the game doesn't launch. I have tried every fix I could find online. There seem to be tons of others who also can't launch the game (going by Ubisoft and Steam's forums), and none of the fixes or workarounds seem to be working for them, either. I don't think this is everyone's experience, but buying a game shouldn't be a crapshoot as to if it will work.

I will be happy to come back and change my review in the future if I ever buy the game and it launches. For now I have asked for a refund.

The best Assassins Creed game since Black Flag.

You can spend hours roaming the different environments in search of a new weapons or crafting materials to better your character and it's exciting when you find that shiney new loot you've been wanting.
The new combat system actually made the game challenging instead of 'Press E to counter-attack' every enemy you come across and insta-killing them.
The map is HUGE, and that's no exaggeration. The map is divided into many regions which you unlock when your travel through them for the first time. This uncovers the region on your map and you can now see points of interest such as villages and towns throughout. The story doesn't take you through all regions, so exploration is promoted to see what is within.
People complain about optimization and fps drops ect because of the DRM. For me, I've had no issue, the game runs smooth for me at high settings and I've had only a few crashes due to my own faults.

An Assassin's Creed game with a bigger open world, with lots of side missions to do, treasures to discover and relic to explore.
A successful and innovative sequel to Assassin's Creed.
A game worth picking up even if you havent played any of the Assassin's Creed games before.

PS: The optimizaiton is okay, it runs fine on my laptop ( I5-6300HQ GTX 965M 16GB ram) and the graphics are AMAZING!!

Oh, forgot to mention there are trading cards and achievements on Steam.

Assassin's Creed® Origins is a great game. One of the best in the series. It drags on for long hours, knows how to take the soul plot and is extremely bored. But there is simply too much in it, and "a lot" is not always good. In some places, the project suffers from controversial decisions, in places - from an overabundance of content and "figures", and somewhere simply because of technical roughness. Yes, and artificially delay the passage at the expense of a system of levels - the idea is still stupid.
But if all the "game-services" are the same as "Origins" (with stories, atmosphere, breakout, and worked out worlds), then the future of a single regime is no longer so scary. Love this game)

Unique background, lots to be discovered, needs a controller for better experience, Ubi combined a lot of good game mechs from recent titles into this game, overall a nice game. Also I trully feel sorry for those who thumbed down this game just because their PCs cannot handle it, the optimization is not that bad (like fallout 4 and Nier), get a better PC LUL.

If you came for a assassins creed experience turn away NOW. This is a level based RPG that is more about power level, weapons, and grind than it is about being a skilled assassin.

========================================

I have to say no on recommending this for a few key reasons. Once again assassins creed has to force the Uplay BS which is broken bc i have to reauthenticate my account EVERY SINGLE TIME i want to play this game. This means just to launch it i have to launch steam, Uplay, google and emails, get the code, apply it to Uplay and only then can i even think of launching this game... why is it in 2017-2021 we seem to have lost the mystical art of launching a game the simple way?

As far as the actual game I will admit i have not played assassins creed since black flag and the whiplash of all the collective changes really hurt my view of the game. It feels nothing like the older titles leading me to believe that they abandoned that original vision that started this ohh so long ago.

The game is built in a very arcade simplistic style compared to other games. graphics were better in basically every older AC title with exception of maybe the original and that is perhaps a tie. The combat system got revamped to boost difficulty and, while i like seeing them try they did a very poor job at it. target lock sucks to use and since you don't auto-position for parries it basically forces you to dodge so it feels a lot more like dark souls than anything. I often skip target lock on most enemies bc it is so bad. camra inside buildings absolutely suck. if you can't make it work. don't try it. The whole level system is just dumb imo. whoever came up with that needs to go back to the drawing board and try again.

As for the good things. I like the callable mount and i wish you could summon a boat. we already have the horse/camel so why not. The leveling system did introduce some interesting skills though some of them blatantly ripped off of shadow of war such as the slo-mo while shooting arrows mid air. the world feels very alive for a AC game and the environment is very immersive. I really enjoy the weekly challenges and other similar things.

All in all its an ok game but, there are some major backtracks for what little we gained in comparison to older AC titles imo. its not worth 60$ by any means. maybe half off its ok.

I've said that many times before, I mentioned it in my Syndicate review and it annoys me that I have to say it once again almost like an old and thousand times repeated cringe meme, so here it is: it's better... but it's just another generic Assassin's Creed game nowhere close to good old AC2 times.

It's much better than Syndicate, no more direct copypasting, the missions now actually have a point. But all the missions I played are built using the same repetitive scheme

1) Meet a generic NPC you probably won't remember tomorrow because it's just a model with a voice, usually no personality or something that would make you feel like you met a person
2) Listen to a generic boring conversation
3) Go and kill

One would say that more games follow a similar scheme and yes that's right. Yes, this is a game with beautiful graphics, a huge open world, similar to many successful titles. So why am I bored in AC... again? Why do I have to force myself to keep playing? Because it feels empty, lifeless. It feels like it lacks a touch of someone who cares about it and not just about the money. It feels pointless.

Even basic things like riding a horse lack polish almost like no QA happened - textures blending to each other.
And there's still Uplay, another needless proprietary layer running on top of that. ♥♥♥♥ Uplay. ♥♥♥♥ that piece of ♥♥♥♥.

I think the last thing that made me give up and uninstall this game was Valhala going EGS-exclusive. This means the story will remain unfinished and I lost the main reason to play this game or even care about Assassin's Creed at all.

Ironically the "present/out-of-animus" parts of the game were more interesting than the actual game.
Whether you'll like this game or now depends entirely on the games you played before. I'm afraid if you played any actual good game, this one will be unenjoyable.

One of the fews good thing I can say about it is that it runs perfectly in Proton.

This is my definite 'goodbye' to Assassin's Creed and probably Ubisoft games in general.

I did not expect a Ubisoft game to be THIS good, highly recommended!

Great story, unbelievable graphics and fun combat.

The start is very tough and hard.
The missions in the start and the place Siwa is very boring, but basically the more you play, the better the game gets.
(Siwa is the start location)
The story is really good.
But amazing game overall.
8/10

I got ASSASSIN'S CREED ORIGINS and ODYSSEY at about the same time. These two games are the only ASSASSIN'S CREED games I have ever played so I cannot compare it to previous games of that series.
ORIGINS is a 2017 release while ODYSSEY is a 2018 release and is technically superior, despite using the same engine. I cannot really pick a favorite out of the two - I prefer the setting of ORIGINS (Ancient Egypt) to ODYSSEY (Ancient Greece) but that is just personal preference and does not mean that Greece is boring. I did prefer playing a female character (Kassandra) in ODYSSEY, ORIGINS has no character choice, although the character Bayek is well voice acted and much better than Alexios from ODYSSEY.
I guess ORIGINS is closer to the AC series, as the characters in ODYSSEY are not really assassins but mercenaries. They are over-powered, especially in the later part of the game and you are not required to use the stealth apporach, in the conquest battles you cannot even use stealth at all, while Bayek from ORIGINS is more vulnerable.
Both games allow maximum exploration, which I love, ODYSSEY has the better leveling system, you level faster and get to chose the perks/skills you want directly, while ORIGINS seems a bit slow and requires you to chose skills that you do not want in order to get those that you want.
Storywise ODYSSEY beats ORIGINS as well as in the side show: cultists, nemesis light, decisions(!), etc. the areas are of a specific level but will level up with the player if they exceed that level. All this stuff got me going on, just one more question mark, just one more camp... 50+ hours went by real quick.
ORIGIN's world looks better - again that Ancient Egypt bonus - even though is is mostly a desert, it looks marvelous. Also I felt more like an assassin on a personal quest rather than a mercenary.
There is however one major issue I have with the AC series: the animus and the story bits in the present. They tear you out of the immersive world to do really stupid "quests" (drink coffee, eat something) with a bland, uninteresting character (Layla). It serves absolutely no purpose and is annoying as hell. I wish Ubisoft would just ditch that entire present day garbage.

Played this game for 60+ hours with intermittent crashing. However the crashing has become so frequent I can't even play the game anymore. As soon as my save loads the game freezes within seconds and takes me back to the desktop. I have tried all the tricks suggested in order to rectify to no avail. Otherwise seems like descent game . . . if I could play it. Not impressed!!!!

The AC:Unity is my my favorite, but I have to admit it, the AC:Origins is the greatest and the best AC game ever, it's definitely worth your time to playing it if you're a fan of this series games, so don't miss it on sale.

Okay, everyone, this is a little piece of my mind to whoever wants to buy this game.

I love & enjoy Ubisoft games a lot they are amazing ... but I will never buy Ubisoft games on PC ever again ... I will stick with PS4 or Xboxone X with this company ... I have a supercomputer that is worth 10K its should work with anything and it does with every other game I have on PC with no problems at all but I had to stop playing this game because of the big problems with it, its unplayable on PC.

This game is amazing when I started it I loved every aspect of it but after a while of going through the extream LAG & the inability to record my gameplay because of the 100% pc usage WoW I had to stop playing it half the way I put 60 hours in it without any satisfaction because of the PC problems again its unplayable on PC.

I do recommend the game its a 9/10 but I do NOT recommend it on PC 0/10... AVOID...AVOID...AVOID buying it on PC

P.s if you want to record and play the game with little problems you have to have one computer to run the game and the other to record the game and this is unacceptable to me.

Thank you everyone have an amazing day

I wanted to play it so bad because of all this positive reviews. However, the game crashed every time I tried to run it. I only managed to run it on windowed mode and screen went black when I tried to run it on fullscreen. That's not how I want to play it. Refunded. One year old and still such issues. I was able to run Shadow of the Tomb Raider on day one and it was just released! And that game is demanding. This is clearly poorly optimised.

EDIT: The game is gorgeous and very immersive. I gave it another chance and it didn't disappoint me.

Edit: (11/2021) 4 years later, new processor and gfx card (Ryzen 3600 and RTX2070), performance is perfect, technology solves the stuttering problem so the devs don't have to. It could be I used to have an Intel processor and now I have AMD, whatever fixed it the game now runs well.

This is my second go at this review, I really need a middle option because simply recommending AC:Origins or not doesn't cover how the game has performed for me. As far as gameplay and story are concerned everything seems good, unfortunately I can not say the same for performance. I am changing my recommendation to Yes, but I have reservations.

Initially I didn't recommend the game because my i5-6600, GTX 1060 6GB, 16GB system was having severe performance problems related to 100% CPU usage. This is something I consider unacceptable on a system that comes in above the minimum recommended specifications. Eventually after a few hours of trouble shooting I managed to get to an acceptable level of performance by having Environmental Detail on its lowest setting and using Adaptive Sync at 30fps. It is important to note however that this does not solve all problems and the game still freezes for seconds at a time, this is in the opening area, I fear getting to larger cities in case the game performance drops back down to unacceptable levels.

It would seem that now is the time games are going to push CPU's to the limit instead of graphics cards and that is a good thing, but it feels as though the development team have gone too far too fast with this game. i7 processors are nowhere near the norm for the majority of gamers and it feels like they have tried to push gaming forward by ignoring what i5 4 core/4 thread processors are actually capable of.

They have made a good game, this is not in doubt, if they had made a good game that performed well at the minimum specs they published it would be so much better.

OK This may very well be one of my favorite Assassin´s Creed game.

Plot: The plot focuses on a Medjay turned Assassin Bayek, seeking revenge against the Order of the Ancients, who killed his son because they´re a bunch of really mean jerks. Along our journey we come across many colorful character, including Bayek´s wife Aya, soon to be pharaoh Cleopatra, and military general Julius Caesar. All of these characters felt unique in their own way, and while their personalities could have been fleshed out more.

Gameplay: Gameplay has undergone yet another large overhaul, with many RPG elements being introduced, including weapon stats and a skill tree. Combat feels fluid and fun but without feeling simplistic. Enemies will rush and outnumber you quickly if you decide to take on several at once. Sneaking around an enemy camp, silently stabbing enemies in the throat with the hidden blade has never felt more fun.

Exploration: While exploration is mostly the same (find tall place, climb tall place, soak in the view), it all still feels fresh and fun. Origins boasts the largest map in AC history, with a multitude of different environments, like cities, deserts, and swamps. Along the way, you can explore tons of places and collect lots of items, making every place worth the trouble.

Overall, its a very good game . i can give it 8.0 / 10 !

I had a good time playing this game, and while I felt it could have done a bit better, I think they really hit the ball out of the ballpark.

Literally took 5 minutes to run the benchmark and I'm running an i7-6700k and 1080ti and my frames didn't get above 60 during 90% of the benchmark.

I alt-tabbed out of the game to check what was wrong in the Task Manager and I could actually SEE the mouse lag and typing lag from the Denuvo and other DRM.

It is unacceptable for games to absolutely DESTROY your performance in order to guarantee sales. Ubisoft has been known to tank performance and degrade graphics in the past, but this is just ridiculous.

One of the best, if not, the best Assassin's Creed installments since the 1st. You truly have to experience this one if you've played the rest of the games, same goes for anybody that is now getting into the whole AC story. 10/10 IGN

I always loved ancient egypt and to have a chance to walk around was amazing experience.

+ Big open world to explore
+ Story - dabbing, story telling and characters
+ Music
+ Views
+ Mythology
+ DISCOVERY TOUR (learn almost everything there is to know about Ancient Egypt. Better than history class?)

- Slightly repetitive
- Big leap from older AC combat system to RPG-like
- A lot of unused space (mountains, deserts etc)

From me its a big thumb up. Its fun to play.

Just finished it, ending gave me goose bumbs.

Loved the game, might be the best assassins creed of the many i played.

The combat is so much more fun, it kinda feels like mount and blade (which i love too) and especially the horse combat was something i used a lot.

Minor "complaints" i have is, that there is no town/ship/greater goal to invest in, i liked that about some of the old parts and that it is quite hard to obtain money and xp after the ending of the game to keep unlocking some stuff.

Cant wait for the dlc :)

I think it's a very good game, but it has got some programming problems:

1 - There are some bugs, but I hope it's going to be fixed in the future.
2 - It always shows a sign in the right corner of the moniter (Your video devices must be updated, bruh bruh bruh...)


From the good side:

1 - The story is very good, and the combat system is pretty good.
2 - I like how is the world very open and not like the old franchise series.
3 - like what have I read about the game, that it's going to be a new story everytime you play.

Some suggestions to make the game better:

by making new main stories every time, (whenever they want) but don't get rid of the game, and sell it like what did Asharf said, and promised us about new stories to the game, and continue some missing chapters after the end of the main story.

And fixing the tech. and programming problems.

I hope you read this, Asharf Ismail. and Thank you for your creative work.

Assassin's creed Origins is a game that you will instantly love as you get into it. Bayek is one of the best characters next to the greatest assassin Ezio Auditore... The story is really gripping and there is so much to explore in ancient Egypt... This is the introduction game to RPG version of assassin's creed and Ubisoft rocked...

Things that you should not miss in this game:

1) The 7 stone circles
2) Both the DLCs
3) Hunting Phylakes (you will get one awesome skin once you kill them all)
4) Exploration mode (Daily tour)
and there is so much more... Just go for it and you won't regret it

This is one great Assassins Creed game. The setting ( EGYPT ), what more can you say. Breathtaking landscape & surroundings, excellent gameplay and story. Go Bayek of SIWA !

You can't go wrong with this ! Enjoyed it very much ( even though a couple things still left to sort out ) !

Even after 1 year, this game still has overwhelming performance issues. With a GTX980, I7 4790K and 16GB of RAM, I can't get a stable 30fps on lowest settings. These issues can undoubtedly be traced to Ubisofts use of both Denuvo and VMProtect, which is only hurting the consumers who got AC Origins legitimately. At this point, pirates can play this for free and with better performance than those of us who bought this for $60.

Other than that, the game is alright. The story is nothing special, but it's not bad. The gameplay is actually really good, especially when compared to some of the previous AC games. The combat has gotten particularly better since games like Brotherhood, where countering was an automatic kill.

If you ask me, I'd say to buy this on 50% sale or more. That is, until Ubisoft (hopefully) fixes the performance.

This is a great game plauged by highly intrusive DRM. The first 12 hours were amazing with good framerates; then Ubisoft issued an update with more DRM that destroyed framerates. 100% CPU usage is not accepable for a non-prime 95 program.
Was this delayed update a ploy to get gamers to play past the refund time then lock-down the game? Very disappointing as the game is very good; however, with the DRM issues I cannot recommend this game. Hopefully a patch will be issued to revert back to the prior state of play-ability. (Not likely...)

I really enjoyed Assassin's Creed Origins, but it is not without flaws.

Pros:
The game heavily borrows from The Witcher 3 and that's okay.
The graphics were good, but not as good as AC: Unity. Unity had the best lighting, materials/textures, and character detail/animations of all the AC games.
Huge, highly detailed open world.
I played on Normal difficulty and found it to be a nice casual experience.
There's lots of options on how to approach situations like Roman forts, but I tended to go for the most efficient way of just sniping guards with the Predator bow. It really felt a little too easy, but that may also be because I was playing on Normal difficulty. If you play on Hard or Nightmare, you may need to use all the extra gadgets and techniques to be successful. Otherwise, all the extra stuff just felt like you had to go out of your way to set them up and execute them whereas just stealth sniping with the Predator bow got the job done very quickly.
Lots of different types of weapons to suit your playstyle, but I got the Legendary Mustapha's Blade early which has instant-charging and I pretty much stuck with that throughout the whole game. Instant charged attacks is just really really strong.
I spent a lot of time just enjoying the scenery and a lot of time sailing around the lake south of Alexandria.

Cons:
Bugs. You will encounter them every now and then. Nothing game breaking, just silly.
The world is huge, but the cities and towns felt small. I feel like Alexandria should have been 10x its size in-game. There's a loading screen tip talking about all the stuff in Alexandria and that doesn't compare to what we actually have in-game. Maybe I'm just comparing them to the size of Paris and London from the previous AC games.
Combat can be clunky. If you fight with your back against a wall, the wall will occlude your camera and you can't really see anything. When using your overpower ability, it doesn't target the enemy that you have targeted - it will often go for some random enemy behind your target or even something completely behind you, wasting the ability. You will get stun-locked often when fighting multiple enemies.
The tools were kind of useless. The poison darts didn't always kill the target and took awhile to run its full course. The sleep darts were great although the sleep didn't last very long. I played on Normal difficulty so I didn't really have to use them but maybe they were more necessary on the higher difficulties. The firepots were useless since they did so little damage. I guess you're supposed to throw them on oil pots but by the end of the game you have bows with fire arrows anyway. You can also throw infinite torches to light oil on fire. Berserk is okay but it wasn't in dart form like the previous AC games which made it annoying. It's just easier to assassinate a target than to Berserk them.
Telltale signs of content that was cut from the game. If Bayek catches on fire, one of his voice lines says something like "I should get that repaired", yet there's no repair mechanic in-game despite blacksmiths and tailors everywhere. Repairing was either cut or it's a jab at the repairing mechanic in The Witcher 3. There's another voiceline that I've only encountered once while randomly walking in a Roman fort talking about a "good boy". I didn't catch the name of who he was referring to, but I think it was supposed to be a horse since his eagle is female. However, there's no one horse like Roach in The Witcher 3. I get the impression that the devs were testing different things for horses such as having one horse (Roach approach), not owning horses at all, and the current approach. There's a lot of things that hint that at some point the player didn't have a horse that they could instantly call from anywhere because there are stables everywhere with a horse available to the player, there are horses just laying around the cities and villages that you can hop on, and even one of the abilities lets you hijack a horse that already has a rider. There's no point in any of those when you can just summon your own horse instantly from anywhere. The Bureau doesn't feel complete to the point of why is it even there other than to get buy the 1000 xp tablets.
There needs to be more variation in activities. It gets to the point where the activities are just clear a Roman Fort or loot a treasure chest. They are essentially the same activity since the Roman forts have treasure chests that you need to loot to "clear" them and the loot treasure chest activities usually are guarded by Romans. There's SO many of these activities and they're all the same. It was very grindy to finish them all.
I don't presonally like desert environments in games and there was a lot of that in Egypt.
There's not enough natural xp from cleaing all the activities and doing all the side quests to unlock all of Bayek's abilities. Once you hit level 40, you can keep leveling up to gain another ability point which is nice, but I've done everything so the only xp I get is from killing guards for 10-20 xp each or the daily quest. You can buy 1000 xp items for 1000 drachmas, but getting money isn't easy after clearing everything either.
Some of Bayek's abilities are just kinda meh. Why hijack a horse when you can assassinate the rider and then hop on their horse or just call for your own horse from anywhere?
Hippodrome is so damn annoying. It's basically RNG. Just keep playing it over and over until you win. If you're a masochist, complete it once and then never return.
I was let down by the Hoarde Mode in the arena. It touts being able to use your own weapons to fight, but you can't use your bows. I really wanted to use my bows in the arena. There's only two events in the arena where you can use a provided warrior bow.
I didn't like that enemies could be a higher level than 40 but I was capped at 40. That didn't make sense.
Rules that apply to you don't always apply to enemies. For example, I could be standing in a fire and catch on fire but some of the enemies would be standing in it fighting me and never catch on fire.
The Final Fantasy crossover quest was stupid and jarringly lore-breaking. I say lore-breaking because I didn't know that it was a Final Fantasy crossover when I started the quest and it really threw me off not knowing what the hell that I was witnessing and how it fit in with the Assassin's Creed universe.
The present day story didn't really advance much at all, just like the previous games. I'm kind of bummed about that as I'd like more on the present day stuff.

I give AC: Origins a solid 8/10. It would be a 9/10 if my above cons were addressed. If you like open world third person action RPGs, try it. I recommend the Normal difficulty to give a more casual experience. I can see the higher difficulties being frustrating with the clunky combat.

I am pleasantly suprised by this game and am just entralled by it. Mostly due to me having nothing to do with this game when I saw it at E3 and the notorious flops of creed in recent years. I picked the game up and was expecting all these issues with DRM and cpu usage but was greeted with a game that supports 21:9, amazing gameplay, and pretty good optimization.

The only issues I have seen myself so far would have to be pathing in some of the opening scenes could have been better but that is honestly it. This game is definitly worth a buy at the price tag and I can see myself getting upwards of 40hrs of gameplay.

If you are on the fence buy it through steam, if you do not like it refund it. Its that simple, and all these people ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about DRM yea I get its an issue but I mean from a retailer point of view thats pretty much the only way they can hope to thwart piraters early. I mean yea its going to get broken easily but at least for the short time they can feel happy.

Game runs perfectly on a 1080 and a i7 6850k @4.4ghz

"This game is the digital equivalent of fast food; it's not great, it might not even be good, but it's inoffensive. I put about 110 hours into the game and came out the end with no strong thoughts on it. Didn't hate it, didn't love it, just played it."

I got bored really quick with this one. Haven't touched it in almost a year and I feel no pull to come back to it. It's an extremely derivative open world with forgettable characters and boring sidequests that are variations of fetchquests or any other generic mission that would be found in a open world (ex. go to point A, bring back item B to person C.). the setting is awesome and the world is really well detailed. wish there was more meaningful content in this one.

buy if it's on a sale

Exactly what I wanted after taking many years off from AC. Last one I played in it's entirety was Brotherhood, the formula had gone quite stale for me. The additions and changes made for this entry work well and the settings works even better. Highly enjoyable!

At Launch origins didnt run well, though that was in part due to my bad cpu/gpu config at the time. since then ive revised the review and overall i can say that this is a really great game had an absolute blast over the years, both in terms of story and gameplay.
Ubisoft have always Aced the world design and i personally have played assassin's creed for world exploration 1st and story 2nd and they are just that good (some of the best in all gaming).
While im still a great fan of ezio's trilogy being the pinnacle of the series in terms of character progression given the amount of time between games and timeframe for the player to get a real connection to the character.
I think origins is a great contender, i just wish they continued with the story arch and progression perhaps even another trio of games.
here's hoping for the future!

$1/hr rule works out well can get at least 80+ hours with dlc and sidequests, though if you are a leisurely player like myself i can say at least 120+ hours not including New game +

SUMMARY
"We are the first to see the gods. The first to tame their beasts. The first to guard the soul from evil. We conquered this land and built an Empire. But there are whispers on the wind. A Brotherhood born in the shadows. They are the first to call themselves... The Assassins. The Creed will last forever. From now on, I will be known as the Hidden One. Papo? Jump !" (Bayek and Khemu). Assassin's Creed Origins is a third-person action-adventure RPG stealth game that will make you fall inlove with drama, romance and history in the times of CLeopatra, Caesar and Ptolemy XIII, all while building your Assassin Brotherhood. The title Origins means that beside unveiling dark secrets, you will find how and why the Brotherhood was created. It is without any doubt one of the best games of the Assassin's Creed series and definitely worth playing for its great story and good combat mechanics.

INFO
- This review is a personal opinion. Try the game for yourself.
- Game was played on max graphics setting and ultrawide resolution.
- The team at Ubisoft poured their blood and sweat in this game. It required around 1000 people and four years to develop this extraordinary game. Unfortunately, the game is quite underrated. While not having massive battles like in Odyssey, Origins has one of the best stories in the series, very interesting chain-quests and some awesome mystery puzzles.
- I played this game first time on Uplay when it was released and for the second time now on Steam (unfortunately you cannot link the Uplay games to Steam if they were bought on Uplay). On the second playthrough I did not find any bugs and even if I had already known the story, the feeling was still great. I would dare say I liked Origins even more than Odyssey.
- Plot starts in 49 BC in Egypt following the adventures of Bayek (a Medjay of Egypt) and his wife Aya. It also takes place in the present day following Layla Hassan, a former researcher for Abstergo Industries, uncovering artifacts and the truth about Bayek and Aya.
- The character's max level is 40 for the main game, 45 for the first DLC (The Hidden Ones) and 55 for the second DLC (The Curse of the Pharaohs).
- To get full legendary gear (and mounts) is fairly easy, but upgrading it to max requires a bit of grinding. Doing enough side-quests, frequent road-looting and looting treasures from killed targets and objectives chests should cover the costs. The same recipe of doing side-quests goes if you feel a bit under-leveled for some story main-quests.

PROS
- Full ultrawide support (very few cutscenes are pre-rendered in 16:9 and pillarboxed).
- A beautiful, well written story about the Ancient Egypt and the Assassin Brotherhood, featuring 128 chain story and side quests (the base game alone) plus more in two DLCs.
- A huge open world with a great, vibrant design of Egypt, along with excellent graphics and love for details. Each region has a different beautiful design, feeling unique and authentic. Egypt modeled in this game is a true spectacle, you will find yourself riding a lot without using the teleports or climbing on top of monuments just to see more of the beautiful scenery.
- A great sensation of scale, be it in the cities, or on top of the Giza pyramid or the Lighthouse of Alexandria. The attention to detail, from the outfits, gear, every house, every corner and statue in a city, to the majestic ancient monuments, the Nile Delta and the mountains, the horses, the ships, the chariots and the personality of main characters in the game, even torches or palm-trees, everything is a piece of art and a show of very hard-work.
- The game is trully a masterpiece from all points of view. On top of that, when you finish the game you get a narrated tour of Ancient Egypt with historical accuracy events and data.
- Egyptians AI are not scarce at all in the cities and they all speak real Egyptian. Each AI has a routine every day (such as working during daytime and sleeping at night and traveling on a set path). Most of the quest-givers do not stay in a fixed position. For most chain-quests, players can choose the time of day to assassinate their targets. Factions respond differently to players.
- Beautiful cutscenes, great soundtrack, good voice-acting.
- Very good, fluent, solid mechanics for combat, climbing / parkour, stealth, sailing. Once discovered, the "leap of faith" points can be used for fast-travel (teleport). Naval combat has its own mechanics and beauty. The night-day mechanic (where the character meditates to change it) is a good addition.
- Plenty of chain side-missions, puzzles and collectibles for completionists.

CONS
- The two DLCs (The Hidden Ones and The Curse of the Pharaohs) should have been part of the main game, or at least implemented into a Definitive Edition.
- Only one ending (compared with Odyssey where you have 9 possible endings or with Valhalla where you have 2 endings).
- In-game micro-transactions (drachmas, outfits, horses, gear, ability points and maps for hidden locations).
- As for all Ubisoft games, you must play it using the Uplay client (it is now called Ubisoft Connect).
- If you bought the game on Uplay and want to have it on Steam collection with achievements and all, you can't. You need to buy the game on Steam again for that.

I preordered. played for 35 hours no issue. Then, all of a sudden I crashed every time i hit play. I spent hours trouble shooting. finnaly I called it quits for the night and flipped on youtube to find out ACO has applied some new attatchments for piracy. I was waiting til I finished to review. but I can't finish. I can't recomend this game.
Update: after 5 days nothing is diffrent. The ubisoft support did nothing but give me busy work and then tell me they cant help. I change from can't recommend this game to don't buy. it runs poorly and ubisoft support will not help

I know people have their gripes with Ubisoft and Uplay. However this has been one of the best Assassin's Creeds since Black Flag. I can't stop playing it. I have a 980Ti and I am not having a problem running the game with a mix of Very High/Ultra settings. It looks great! The atmosphere is outstanding. I do wish there was MORE of a focused story but when it comes to the gameplay, RPG elements, combat etc it's very addicting. I've played almost 17 hours and have enjoyed every bit. My game has NOT crashed once. Those people complaining about not maxing the game out when you have the recommended requirements.... it clearly says at the bottom of the recommended requirements (VIDEO PRESET: HIGH 1080P). So if you are trying to run at 2K and 4K maxed out.... good luck. Its up to Nvidia and AMD to release dirvers to push those cards harder.

UPDATE: ever since the patch I am now running the game on Ultra Settings

This is everything I ever wanted out of the Assassin's Creed series in terms of gameplay. You no longer simply press counter to auto-kill your enemy, the parkour button no longer makes you sprint so now you don't automatically stick to every surface in the game while trying to navigate tight spaces and quests and items are more meaningful to your character's progression instead of being a mindless collectathon.

Out of the countless things I love about the game, the immersive nature of the world itself is my favorite part. Setting a goal for yourself, such as a quest half way across the map, and navigating your way there based solely on landmarks while getting into exiting adventures lasting several hours or more never got boring. There was always something new and interesting to see and do which is something I never thought I'd say about an Assassin's Creed game. If you're familiar with the series you'll notice a strong conscious effort by the developers to do away with everything people were annoyed with in the previous entries. Among other things it lets you untrack quests so there are no waypoints, you don't desynchronize if you stray too far away from your target and it's almost impossible to get stuck while riding your mount since it can jump over obstacles and down steep cliffs.

The story and characters of the Assassin's Creed games has never been able to live up to the second game's memory and I'm sad to say that still hasn't changed. Origins' effort is certainly an improvement over later entries but it still doesn't reach the same level of character development and mystery that Assassin's Creed 2 had. I think a part of the reason for that is that Ezio was a rich kid playboy turned super cool assassin and as far as living vicariously through a video game character goes it doesn't get much better than that. I also don't like that the present day plot is basically optional at this point. There are a lot of notes with plenty of backstory on present day events and characters if you read through it but it's never presented to the player as a priority. I see this as a blatant compromise by the developers to please both those who like the present day plot and those who don't. I'd prefer it if it was given a more prominent place in the narrative as a whole.

The best thing about the game however is that you can perform fighting animations in the animus loading screen again! That hasn't been a thing since Revelations and I've always missed it. Ironically I'm playing with an SSD now so even though it's back I still don't get to enjoy it. C'est la vie. And I'm not usually a sucker for social features but photo mode is quite ingenious. Now you can spend an embarrassingly large amount of time getting the lighting and framing just right before posting your picture only for it to be completely ignored by the community while a far more mediocre one gets thousands of likes. Just like in real life! The attention to detail is something I never expected to see from an Assassin's Creed game. For example, did you know that if you wiggle the left stick while controlling Senu she'll do a barrel roll? I'm very impressed by the game and remain optimistic about the future of the series.

I haven't finished the game yet, and as far as progress through the main story I haven't gotten all that far yet either, but I can already recommend this game very very emphatially.

ACO is essentially a return to what I loved about the AC franchise from the start. I fell in love with AC2, but unfortunately from that point on it seemed like the series lost its way. It wasn't so much about the basics anymore, and I lost interest because I played AC to, basically, be an assassin, not to rebuild towns or play some weird combination of AC and Civilization.

ACO strips all that other crap away and goes back to what I loved about the games. The setting is gorgeous, the cities feel alive, the plot is just enough to keep the motivation there without being too much. It's basically about just being an assassin again, and while the missions can get a bit repetitive the scenary is more than enough to keep me going.

So if you gave up on the AC franchise kind of like I did, give this one a shot. It might remind you why you liked it in the first place.

This is actually an Assassin's Creed game which is fun and together with Black Flag the best in the series.
Graphical wise this game challenges the attention of detail the Witcher 3 had. The crafted world is stunning. For the first time for me exploring was fun, as everything felt handcrafted and with a purpose.
The gameplay mechanics are also good.

But still, besides the beautiful world, this game leaves me disappointed thinking what could've been done with the solid ground work.
It's not that any part I will list now is bad, but music, story and characters are only ok or good.
With an amazing story and story characters you could relate to this game could rival the Witcher 3. But in it's actual state all that remains is a very good open world game.

Finally! An AC with a difficulty option! I remember enjoying the challenge of the very first game, but every game since has gotten progressively easier due to the mainstream crowd. In most of the AC games you didn't have to sneak at all except for the bad "instant game over if they see you missions". All you had to do was run into the middle of everybody and start mashing counter, or worse yet stand on a roof and point at people as your crew does everything for you.

All that is gone now. Just you, sometimes some npc's tag along for a mission but you can still maintain stealth even while they are in combat. YES! Haven't encountered any other stealth game that allows this.

Now you can slap this bad boy on Nightmare and actually be motivated to hide. If you get seen though? Go loud throwing bombs or even lead them on a deadly wild goose chase! No more instant fail ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!

Pros:
Setting is amazing. The art and world they have made is gorgeous. This is the best part of the Assassins creed series, feeling immersed in a different time and place, living the history. They nail it again.

The water. Wow.... Just wow....

The skill trees offer a meaningful choice of archery/sneaking vs Melee with tools and support skills as a support tree. I kept wanting to level up or get more points so I could get that edge.

Archery is awesome. The 4 different bow types surprised me and offers players an actual choice of bows for once. The sniping Predator bow is my favourite. In the right hands it can clear a camp full of guys from around corners.

Cons:
Characters felt lacking for me in this game. The main two protagonists are great, but there's too many characters with too little development in my opinion. Sometimes bad things happen to your "friends" and I had a hard time caring as they had mere seconds of screen time before dying or suffering.

Gladiator fights: Forces you to use sword and board. Opponents use a bow, Your ally uses a bow, why the hell can't I?

♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ loot boxes and microtransactions: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ why!? Yes you can play without them but their mere existance affects balancing choices the devs make. I don't want to grind in a single player game, but there's no WAY I'm handing over cash to buy some materials. Piss off.



Overall I'm really enjoying this game and highly recommend it if you like AC or stealth games.

Assassin's Creed Origins is the most unique game i ever played
. Ubi worked one more year on Assassin's Creed franchise and it's worth,
because they didn't like COD or how they did before, each year to publish a new game just to do big money. They really worked a lot on this game, every single object!
Ancient Egypt is just 100% i wanted to see and in this game i saw those 2 years of working of the Ubisoft.
PROS:
- Unique game
- A lot of work from the part of the Ubisoft. Game wasn't made just for money like they did before...
- Very, very big map
CONS:
- On my i5 4460/gtx 950/ 8gb ram/windows 10, i run the game on 1080p 20-40fps low-medium settings and it's a little awkward but it's playable.
Here are my 2 gameplays

Probably the most polished, bug-free, Assassin's Creed game to date.
A masterpiece in my opinion.

I love this game.
First Assassin'c Creed game I played longer than 30 minutes.
Graphics are really top-notch.
Plays kinda like The Witcher.
Glad my old Titan X can run this game at max settings without any hitch!

“This is Assassin’s Creed 2.0, as Baby’s twice as awesome as anything released before Witcher 3.” - Rebecca Crane

When developers learn from CD PROJEKT RED, this is what you get.

Amazing game, about 30 hours in and most of the map still undiscovered. Interesting side missions, main missions and characters.

Performance wise this game runs amazingly in most areas although cities can be quite heavy on hardware. After further playing, I've noticed my frames increasing when playing at 1440p as apposed to 1080p... weird.

Buy this game if you enjoyed Witcher 3 and love AC. If you thought the franchise was heading downhill, think again.

This game was not in my bucket list, nor i was considering it to buy it in near future. Saw the reviews of game which was positive, So thought to give it a try.
This is not the same Assassin creed Game which we are used to play. This is different from its predecessors, that's make this game unique and awesome. After the witcher 3 every single player games were doomed to me, But this is awesome.
The protagonist of the game Bayek is so relatable, the world is so big and beautiful, most of the time you will just roam to see its beauty created by the developer.
Side quest are awesome and have its own soul.
I have 50+ hours in game and i haven't yet finished act 2 after which 3 more story act remains.
I love the new mechanics of the game and how its play. There was some problems with the cpu usage, which is now fixed.
At 1440p High setting am running this game around 80 to 90 fps in big cities in games and around 100 t0 120 in open areas of the map.
There are also weekly challenges in game for the player who love to explore the game after the completion of the story.
Overall its a great game for the assassin creed franchise and the gamers who love it.

I was a big fan of Black Flag but found Syndicate too repetitive and that the storyline was dull. I had high hopes for Origins but, sadly, I’m really disappointed and wish I hadn’t spent the money. If you are an AC fan and you have to play this game, wait until it’s on sale.

The biggest problem for me is that the storyline is dull: the quests you go on are all around the same theme (I’ve lost this, someone has taken that – go get it for me and bring it back). The lack of variation makes it so boring to play and I find myself dual screening whilst playing. Levelling is irritating and adds to the poor experience of game play; when you are level 10 you can kill anything up to, and including, level 10 with ease but enemies level 11 or 12 annihilate you immediately, even if you have invested heavily in stealth tactics. Adversely, even on hard mode it’s not challenging enough to upgrade your armour and kit: ‘legendary weapons’ don’t require enough struggle to feel special or well earned.

I’m not even going to start on how badly optimised the game is…

Give it a miss!

I do not at all doubt that others are having performance issues, however, I'm not experiencing them at all. I read that some people with a 1080 and decent CPUs are having dips to 15 FPS but I am running a 1080 and a 7700 and have encountered zero problems. The game is a lot of fun and the free running feels effortless unlike Syndicate and Unity. Combat is refreshing and is reminiscent of The Witcher. World is massive but some quests feel kind of weak. Overall 7/10, pretty good.

Haven't even been able to get into the gameplay of the game, keeps crashing. Apparently if you can actually play it still keeps crashing. Have a look all over the internet, so many users have been experiencing this since 2017 (currently 2020!). Absolutely terrible, don't waste your money buy anything else.

Great refreshment of the series with a just big enough, immersive and good looking open world. The main story is a good experience also in terms of an Assassin's Creed game. Some side quests and locations can get repetitive at times but there's a lot of unique stories.

Amazing!.....That would be an understatement. This is the best Assassins Creed game ive played in a really long time. While there have been some issues plaguing this game since its release there has been a patch released to remedy these issues and there will be more soon! The new fight mechanics are a breath of fresh air compaered to Assassins Creed Syndicate and its terrible animations......And the map seems endless and its simply Beautiful in its presentation. The Story is also top notch with incredible voice acting. Im simply addicted to this game i cant put the controller down!

This game is a must have!!! 9.5/10

I got to say this is the BEST assassins creed game (well that and black flag), im so glad they held back a year to polish this game. I'm very easy to please and i cant say anything bad about this game. Runs beautifully on my pc, graphics are mind blowing, game pl ay is fun, doesnt feel tedius like other instalments.
Being an Ancient Egypt history buff, they sure do it justice, pure Architecture porn and "lore"
The RPG elements feel fresh but kinda poor comparing it to other RPGs, but the combat feels new compared to easy counter "guns blazing" previous Asscreed games.

while its not 10/10 perfect it was worth every peso to me.

Takeaway: A strange but competent entry to the AC series that continues to breakaway from expected franchise norms.

Pros:
-Good graphics
-Massive open world to explore
-Quests have a lot of variation and are reasonably long
-Some built in "cheat"/"game modding" options

Cons:
-Stealth feels more like a gimmick than an actual choice (really weird for an AC entry)
-Tepid revenge plot
-Very limited secondary weapon/tool options (compared to previous AC games, this felt like a big step backwards, & further hurts the game's stealth)
-Gated content (thanks to a new leveling system)
-Loot boxes & the accompanying grind mechanics

Conclusion:
Still good but didn't really feel like an Assassin's Creed game, it could've been called "GTA Ancient Egypt" with it's lackluster stealth experience & bizarre quests.

The best AC game since Black Flag. It is a huge change from the established AC formula but the series desperately needed one. This game adds some RPG elements into the game, including a skill tree, and a major focus on level progression. The combat system has been completely reworked. It is well done and precise, but the lack of variation in it can get pretty boring, at least in the beginning. It gets better once you start unlocking more skills, though. The previously mentioned level progression is some of the most extreme I have ever seen. Sometimes it works well, making certain enemies and areas a fun challenge if you choose to try them before you should, but many times it is way too over the top, making enemies literally impossible to beat. The difference between you and a standard grunt that is five levels above you is so drastic that it basically becomes a Dark Souls fight: don't get hit or you die instantly and hack away at him for 10 minutes. This is especially frustrating when it comes to the "Assassinate" ability, since you can't kill someone who is a higher level than you with it, which severally hampers the "stealth" style of gameplay. The best part of the game is by far the Phylakes. The are basically optional bosses in the game that can be found roaming around the map, or will come to you if you "mess up" while clearing the local fort. These are the intentional Dark Souls fights of the game whether you are the same level as them or not and they get intense. They also drop the best loot. The two DLC expansions are also pretty good.

After numerous dissapointments, this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game has renewed this series and brought back my interest in the Assassin's Creed Games. The absolute freedom of movement and beautiful graphics truly are a great selling point of the game. Combat is actually challenging and you have to know when to pick your fights becoming surrounded is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and will probably end up with you getting your ass kicked. Stealth is no longer stupid easy and also not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the same time, with the map now built more open, gives more chances on how you want to play.

An awesome experience. Definitely worth it if you're into Assassin's Creed.

Even if (imo) the gameplay/mechanics are different than the previous games, it's still a nice, fluid and smooth game - interesting story, and an amazing place to explore - loved going thru the old tombs and visiting ancient Egypt.

Plus if you dont have it yet, you'd probably be able to get it a good price.

Ubisoft really revived the series with this one. Everything about it is polished, the combat feels satisfying and rewarding, and not in any way easy. I played through the game on hard difficulty, and while it was not incredibly hard, posed a substantial challenge. The story really ramps up from the beginning, with the end of the game feeling as frantic and hectic as the designers must have designed it to be. Some moments in the game are funny, and they almost never feel forced.

The story is good, and while not being amazing, feels great to play and finish. It even stirred enough emotional response to make me want to cry and burst out laughing at the same time It was when the child got drowned .

At the beginning of the game, I believed that Bayek was more of a player insert character than anything else, but there were always moments that reminded me that he was not simply that. The world feels real and tangible, and all of the NPC's walking around and going about their business gives it a real lively feel. The music is good, but I did hear alot of the same tracks play over and over again.

The graphics, of course, are great.

Overall I rate this game 10/10 for it's ingenuity, world and story. GOTY? Maybe. Best AC game yet? Probably not. Revives the franchise? Certainally. Worth 60$? Id gladly pay 100 if all games were like this.

beautifull graphics, amazin' storyline, good combat and a lot of variety (or how you spell it :P )
even for the 60 euro the game is pretty much worth it.

Origins is certainly a bit more daring in its combat, but in other ways it moves the series even closer to the traditional RPG territory with which it has always flirted. In addition to its conventional levelling system, which gradually grows Bayek’s health and damage and keeps players from taking on tougher enemies before Ubisoft wants them to, players will also encounter familiar looking menus for managing quests, gear, and inventory, as well as a very straightforward skill tree that gradually develops Bayek’s abilities. I suppose some might criticize the lack of innovation here, but for me it was comforting. There’s enough to see and do in Ubisoft’s Ancient Egypt that I didn’t feel the need to learn a spate new systems to deal with it all.

And really, that’s the main reason to play: to see Ubisoft’s Egypt. Bayek makes a fine addition to Assassin’s Creed’s already strong roster of protagonists, and his story a nice supplement to the franchise’s complex and expanding lore, showing us the roots of the conflict experienced in games set in later eras. But the ancient and sand swept land he calls his home is the real star of Assassin’s Creed Origins, worth visiting even if it hadn’t any heroes or villains.

Awesome game. Strongly recommended,
One of my favorites, cool story, good world, good main character too
Learned a lot about Egypt too
Different from the old ones but if you like assassin's creed you like this one too. I liked more this combat style
Maybe wait for sale and buy with season pass too. DLC's are worth it

Assassin's Creed Origins has a huge open world with many side missions and tombs. Ancient Egypt looks amazing and Bayek is a great dude! You can use Senu the eagle as a spy and the game is working with a skill tree.
It is a pitty that you always have to play side missions to level up so you can continue your main story. Every move you make feels so long because the world is so large. Recommended!

Vivid historiacal characters (Cleopatra, Caesar...) and deities (Amun, Horus...). Stunning scenery. Intense combats. The assassinating system did change somehow (level barriers are really hard to get over...), but think about it: this is 49 B.C., the creed had just formed. Sometimes fightings are necessary instead of just assassinating all the time. You'll see how the first people of the creed gathered and learnt their ways of doing things.

The setting is Ptolemaic Dynasty - almost the end of ancient Egypt, which means that tombs of real pharaohs (or officials) throughout the ancient Egypt calendar, from Djoser to Smenkhkare, remain for you to explore. And these tombs are well-detailed, with hieroglyphic texts (fortunately Bayek knows how to read those lol), grave goods, mummies, and the four pots holding the organs... Have you ever wanted to dig into the three Pyramids in Giza? Or to get inside the Great Sphinx? Or to witness the mummification process? This is the game that can realize your wish. You'll even have the chance to face the deities themselves - Anubis, Sekhmet, Sobek, and so on - and get their theme outfits.

Okay this is not a Tomb Raider review (but again most of these are real tombs existing or existed) so besides that, great protray of famous cities - Alexandria, Memphis, Krokodilopolis... Also great portray of people's struggle in this time period, of Egyptians' anger and complaints about the invading Greek/Roman culture. People's everyday lives are simulated based on the day and night system over this huge open-world map of Egypt.

The Hidden Ones & Rise of the Pharaohs DLCs. The Hidden Ones is simply an extended map and story based on the assassins, which is not too much of a surprise. However the second DLC absolutely is to me. In this DLC, map of the Valley of the Kings is available for players, and a new long exciting story based on the revival of four of the most well-known pharaohs throughout the history - Ahenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamun, and Ramesses II. The first two are known for their abolition of the multi-deity god system, replacing which with one single god Aten. Tutankhamun, son of Ahenaten, after claiming his throne, re-established original deity system and is of course, also known for his golden death mask. Ramesses the Great, on the other hand, is not part of this disputation but is known for the great military power he brought to ancient Egypt during his reign. What I cannot expect more of this DLC are the chance players have to enter these pharaoh's afterlives, from their tombs, and the new lengendary outfits & weapons awarded after the afterlife missions.

The new Discovery Tour mode, offers the choice of visiting all important places around Egypt with a vocal guide, and no fights will be elicited. (You will not take damage from no matter how high you jump from.) Great design for people who want to chillax from all the fightings and enjoy their Egyptian vacation. Also, the built-in photo mode is an incredible tool for screenshot lovers. I've never seen anything like this in any games before.

Overall, a must-play for AC fans and for those who are into ancient Egyptian culture/mythology. Thank you so much for bringing these mythical creatures and lengendary sceneries back to life. Absolutely Amazing.

This game just got out from the original good stories of Assassin's Creed...
For me the story was boring and a lot of microtransactions in-game. I don't recommend it.
If u want to buy a new and good Assassin's Creed try the Assassin's Creed Odyssey for me was a better experience than this.

This game is amazing! I absolutely loved this title and everything about it. The quests and story are very engaging, The combat is visceral and rewarding. The skills are for the most part exciting and fresh. The world is beautiful and the game rewards exploration. The eagle is a great addition and it takes out the stress of finding every last treasure chest. It also makes stealth more tactile and worthwhile. I highly recommend this title.

Probably the best game I have ever played. Amazing storyline, very touching. The graphics in this game are stunning. All the details are so well made and it really makes you feel like you are in Egypt for real.

Only downside that I have is that the game requires you to have a heavy machine in order to run the settings on high or even ultra depending if you want 60fps or a slideshow. Other than that, great game and cheers to Ubisoft.

Ubisoft™ presents Assassin's Creed® Origins™

Assassin's Creed® Origins™ is a Ubisoft™ game that is part of the Assassin's Creed® franchise
in which you, the player™ get to experience the memories of Layla Hassan's™ Ancestors and see where
the Creed began and how it came to be.

That all sounds so exciting but but you don't really get to see a refined version of this until you get to the DLC™

OOPS.

Right, well the gameplay in this one was a big breath of fresh air for me, the combat for the series peaked at AC III-IV® for me and this was such a massive departure from how you expect an AC® game would play, that I just kind of fell in love with it. That doesn't mean that there aren't any drawbacks and stuff like that.

We ARE talking about Ubisoft™ here, so you're gonna have to go and do all that OPEN-WORLD-ACTION-RPG-MAP REVEAL™ type of stuff by getting on top of a really really high place so you can see more stuff. It is nice to see with this engine for like the first few times but since this map is MASSIVE, it gets kind of old pretty fast.

The weapon types that you can use are pretty fun, you might be overly reliant on the shield at some points and that would kind of devolve the game into a BLOCK-PARRY-ATTACK-BLOCK-BLOCK-ATTACK-BLOCK-HEAVY ATTACK-BLOCK sort of pattern sometimes. I'm sure many reviews have referenced that the CoMBaT iS dArK SoULs-EsQuE so I don't have to.

The levelling system is there so you don't progress to regions that you aren't supposed to be in until a certain period in the game BUT if you're just doing side quests here and there, you can be over-levelled for a story mission and the results are pretty funny when some random antagonist just talks trash or is hyped up during a cutscene and you just clap them cheeks hard in less than 2 strokes.

The story is pretty okay. Revenge is a good motive for a lot of narratives and it fits well here. Bayek® is a pretty well rounded character. He's got moments where he shows he cares, moments where he shows his resolve and moments where the man is at his most vulnerable. He's no Ezio® but he doesn't need to be. He's a good character who only gets better over time.

Now, the creed stuff though, a lot of it gets slowly fleshed out but a good chunk of that and the infancy of the Assassin® Brotherhood is seen on the Hidden Ones® DLC. There you'll actually see how they start out and sort of function as a working brotherhood, doing contract work and all that jazz. Pretty cool ngl but that sorta stuff should have STAYED IN THE BASE GAME.

Your mileage with this game may vary, cause the early hours of the game might turn you off completely.

It is a pretty okay game, decent time sink if you're looking to explore Egypt but don't wanna buy a plane ticket.

I wish they didn't re-use so many textures, but honestly a fantastic game. Fun progression, combat, story telling. Great atmosphere and graphics, just an enjoyable game all around so far. 67 hours in and I still see at least 100 more ahead of me.

Assassin's Creed Origins changes up Assassin's Creed by making it feel like a more traditional RPG, but manages to keep enough of the Assassin's Creed roots to keep the game feeling familiar. I haven't beaten the game yet, but I intend to as soon as I can find the time(which it will require a lot of).

Really fun game for fans of Assassins Creed and historical settings. This is my first AC since 3 and I have to say I am enjoying the direction it has went. The map is massive and there is alot to do. The RPG elements are a good addition. I recommend getting the game on sale since they went pretty heavy on trying to get you to buy microtransactions. None of them seem necessary but I will never accept them as something to implement in a fully priced game.

Cool game, beautiful environment, interesting characters, fun combat, and tried and true stealth - i.e. great core game.

Average story (its been done before), traveling can get monotonous, not alot of emphasis on exploration despite open world - i.e. significant missed opportunities.

EXTREMELY annoying grind when it comes to leveling, which you'll need to do to progress, glitches prevalent, gear is not just available in store despite it seeming that way (so dont buy anything from the store) - i.e. awful business practices.

It's a great game but unfortunately I can't even get myself to continue it because of the annoying grindfest you eventually reach. Purchase at your own risk, and if you're willing to put in the time. Personally, I don't want to pay dollar amount for a game that tries to get me to purchase stuff in its DLC by a) conveniently obscuring the fact that you can get gear items availalble in store, in game, and b) making progress and gear upgrades purposely slow

Personally wouldn't recommend for the annoying grind, and the distasteful emphasis on pushing you toward the store (think shadow of war), despite a solid core game. I'd personally get it at 50% discount, not full retail.

A VERY welcome change of pace and game mechanics in the Assassin's Creed series.
I wouldn't say it's ground breaking, but the change in mechanisms and gameplay is refreshing.

GREAT graphics, well made plot (although the vengence motivation is a bit thin...) and fun to travel around the ancient Delta of the Nile. Game is bug free, and the DLC is a bit redundant - "more of the same". It does kind of color the birth of the Assassin order, and adds a new trend of "supernatural" vibes to the game beyond the precursor race... but all in all the DLCs are a "take it or leave it" kind of deal.

All in all, a welcome change to the series and a fun game to play and enjoy.

Looks nice, 1440p maxed ultra settings runs 60-100fps, average around 74. The game looks great and runs decent. However its initial release has a sound hang in cutscenes that sound like driver hangs on windows lmao. Also laggy cutscenes. Surely the day1 patch will fix this. The intro is a bit unclear, who you are isn't but exactly what you are doing and why you are fighting is.


Pros:
-Great landscapes
-Improved freedom controls
-lively environment
-detailed lives of the people, irrigation systems and hunting/wildlife
-i love the avenge missions, like Shadow of War where you can avenge friends and find their killers.
-public screenshots appear on the map, but nonintrusively
-Subtle things that work that you don't notice. On the map location names become visible and fade.
-Chained sidequests that can sometimes be really neat. For example, the sidequest "Children of the streets, the victim you save wants you to continue helping by killing the perp. However she tells you to come back later. I followed her to get it, and she stopped at several places, inspecting the events of the quest before. Very interesting and something easily missed/overlooked that you would never know.
-Its the little things. Today I ran into 3 romans raising a dead guy on a crucifix. In the act. Pretty neat.

Cons:
I expected the music to be better and more authentic.
One speed for you and your horse. No running or galloping.
I had hoped the pyramids would be a bit more intricate and interesting.
I expected more authentic death traps and leverage puzzles.
Finding your way in some underground areas were maddening. My most unpleasant experience with the game.

In the past I have tried to be an AC fan. I could never really bite into the first one, all that Abstergo stuff, and the weird matrix borders in a game seemingly set in the past. It was like you could never really get immersed. But I loved the Prince of Persia style parkour, and the idea. Always loved the idea.

Then I played the fifth one, Black Flag, being a huge fan of nautical games I could not resist. And it was better, it fixed a lot. The world seemed more open, the character had more, well, character. It was highly enjoyable, but I always chalked it up to the fact they had thrown in a pirate theme.

So then Origins came out. And I watched, and I waited. Having played Witcher 3 to the point of breaking, I was looking for something similiar. This seemed right, but, I told myself, it is AC. There will be matrix borders and Abstergo nonsense, and I will probably not dig the character. No pirates.

But I rolled the dice. And I won.

This game is phenomenal.

I am not even done with the main story. I have completed tons of side things and have not even scratched the surface of the amount of side things. I still have I believe 6 or 7 regions I the map is dark on, a couple more the map shows but only because I peeked in and then left, and have not touched DLC. 70 hours of gameplay, and I feel like I am not even near 50%. And that excludes wandering around, taking photos, and just generally enjoying the scenery.

The map is HUGE. The world feels so alive, and just right. I read many reviews, and heard complaints of nothing to do. Nonsense. The map makes perfect sense. By the Nile there are tons of towns and tons of people, lots of activity. Out in the desert and the rocky platues? Not so much. Makes perfect sense to me. But just when you get comfortable with the idea that nothing is out there, boom, bandits ambush you. It is absolutely perfect.

Combat is beatiful, smooth. Weapons are varied, love the different bows for different situations.

Characters are excellent. So many good characters. I have found myself laughing out loud multiple times. Bayek is a really likable character, and yet kind of not. Which I feel is just right. It is like he likes what he does, as far as standing up for the people, but does not like what he must do. And I get that feeling as the player at times in this game. Seen some reviews negatively speaking of quests, and yes, many are essentuilly repeats as far as mechanics. For example you find yourself having to rescue someone from a cage a LOT. However it is the characters and the story surrounding the mechanics that I find wipe away the repetition. They did a wonderful job as far as I am concerned.

I have to say it, this game has made me, after years, and a few tries, an AC fan. It is so gorgeous. At first I wanted a way to turn off the shared screen shots on the map thing, thought it spoiled some views and tombs etc. But now I am actively taking photos and watching for them to show up on the map lol. Even the stupid photo mode gimmick has me hooked. Then there is the hippodrome for chariot racing which is quite entertaining, and the arena.

I really can not say enough about this game. If you are at all on the fence, and if you are looking for your next free roam open world game, this is it. My only regret on this one is not picking it up sooner. Although the sale price is amazing. Picked up gold edition for the price of standard. 150% worth it.

What I feel they could have improved upon
They could have added a couple of hours to the main storyline by either creating more character depth to the "bosses" or simply just by prolonging the storyline.
Increase the difficulty of the achievements.
The nightmare difficulty doesn't really feel like nightmare difficulty.

As a massive fan of the Assassins's creed series i cannot think of a single bad thing to say about this one. It took me almost 100 hours on pc to 100% this game (on ubisoft that is due to steam achievements being broken). This game has a wonderful combat system and, after stepping away from Ezio/Desmond, Bayek is one of the most unforgettable characters i have ever came across in all my years playing this game series.

The fact that you can fully explore almost every location, unlock awesome weapons that devastate your opponents and you get to unlock skills that help you on your journey to take down the "order". You can explore some of the most famous Egyptian locations like, The river nile to cyrene. The library of Alexandria to the Krokodilopolis. You can also see the great pyramids of GIZA, and they are historically accurate, with a few extra tunnels. If you are looking for extra sites to see and places to visit there is more, alot more to explore and visit. If you are looking for an even greater challenge, you can challenge the gods, Anubis, Sobek, and Sekhmet. You get some pretty sweet loot from killing these gods, but dont worry, they dont stay dead haha. Another great thing about this game is the story in general, it has one of the stongest story's since the departure away from ezio and desmond. It shows you how the symbol became to be and it will keep you wanting more and more each time you complete it. It also has one of the best questing systems a game can offer you and it has an exploration mode (this means no waypoints or guidance) so you can figure it out yourself.

All in all i say this is an assassins creed you cannot miss out on. 10/10 one of the best assassins creed to date. Brought the series back and (without ezio as a main plot) im sure it will be one hell of a new story to continue. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this with all my heart as it deserves it. Did not disappoint me at all!!!

If you experience game freezes that occur for like 5 seconds and have the NVIDIA Driver 451.48, uninstall it because this happens due to the new NVIDIA Driver. Roll back to 446.14 and the freezing is gonna be fixed. Otherwise, this game is really worth it

My favorite Assassin's Creed.

I've been a so-so fan of the Creed series. Really enjoyed III and IV, finished both of those but was feeling burned out in Syndicate, never finished that one. I enjoyed the characters and setting in Syndicate but the mechanics were starting to feel worn.

Origins revitalized the series for me. I like the changes in combat, no more waiting for enemies to rush one at a time so you can time the parry and insta-kill counter attack. Combat feels more involved and it's easy to get overwhelmed and beat down by numbers if you don't exhibit a little bit of caution.

The setting is fun to explore. One of the few games where I finished the main story line and continued playing to keep exploring. I discovered new areas not because the game mechanics told me i had to climb this tower to discover it but because i wanted to.

I liked the main story but many of the side quest were just as enjoyable. Many of the characters involved in the side quest are memorable for the story arc involved in those quest. The main characters were well portrayed as well, with every swing of my sword I felt Bayek's rage.

Highly recommend this game.

I just wanted to say thankyou to all artists , creators of Assassins Creed Origins, the dedicated who did the work the love for details and honest representation of Egyptian History and the way they have brought it to this game is wonderful. . I recommend this game for anyone who loves Egyptian Lore and desires an understanding of it.
This game includes a discovery tour which should be given an award.
Not only is it beautiful to experience but also gives the player a real opportunity to experience the history and get a good understanding how the game stays true to real life.
I applaud you Ubisoft.
Excellent Game one of the best.

Easily one of my favorite games of 2017, I can see why some people may dislike it - but I came into it with lower expectations due to the last few games in the Assassin's Creed series, and a dislike of ubisoft and uplay as a whole. However, boy was I wrong - all of my expectations surpassed.

The side quests can be annoying, they can be repetative and they can be very cliche... but that is pretty much the same with any game. If you enjoy games in the assassins creed series, if you enjoy psuedo-stealth games like Shadow of Mordor/War and Dishonored 1/2, then you will enjoy this game.

If you enjoy history, if even if it's being slightly altered to fit a game and storyline, you will enjoy this game.

If you enjoy an epic tale of a man who lost everything on a quest of vengeance that will change the entire political landscape of Egypt and potentially the future of civilized life as we know it - you'll enjoy this game.

The main quest alone is worth the price that I paid (I got it on sale), and the combat, exploration, and beautiful open-world, tombs, and mechanics on the game just made it all the easier to justify paying for this game.

3 important questions before i start the review:

1.Why is everyone in the game talking like Ugandan Knuckles?
(You cannot unhear it anymore, everytime the main character speaks or talks to tha qween)
2.Why do the main charcter and his wife look like brother and sister ?*yikes*
3.How many people do you need to plot the death of a child?

Disclaimer:
I stopped playing the Assasins Creed series after brotherhood since it was always the same rehashed game with little to no innovation and too easy ne hit kill everyone combat. I hated Assassins Creed.But Origins managed to get me curious again.

Difficulty:
Play it at least on hard if you want somewhat a challenge.

Gfx:
The Graphics are amazing but the game is demanding and iI think very cpu heavy. Some of the scenearies are breathtaking and everything looks handcrafted and the game is one of the biggest games I've seen yet. (That's what she said am I rite?)

Story + Lore + Setting:
Tbh I didn't like the story, the setting Egypt and the lore that much. Maybe that is just me.

Quests: Didn't find them enganging enough but there are much worse games out there.

Combat system: Much better this time around an quiet enjoyable.

All in all I think it was a really decent game with loads of content. If you are a completionist you can at least get 60 hours or maybe even more out of the game but since I dont like generic open world activities so I skipped lots of them.

In retrosepct I should have directly bought AssCreed Odyssey swince it has mythological creatures in it etc. Origins has a more down to earth approach (there is a dlc with mythological creatures though)

So yeah a recommend from me but I'd recommened it even more to buy Odyssey instead.

A fresh start

The Assassin's Creed franchise has been around since 2007 and this year mark the 10 year anniversary of the series.

Over the 3 last years Assassin's Creed had some ups and downs but one major complain that most of the players had was that the games were becoming repetitive and stale. Assassin's Creed Origins however feels new, fresh and shows how a franchise can evolve.

Assassin's Creed Origins is an RPG action adventure game that tells the story of Bayek, a Medjay from Siwa that seeks revenge from a group called The Order Of The Ancients, while we get to see how the assassin brotherhood that we know formed from scratch.

In terms of world design, Ancient Egypt is vast, full of colors and the locations feel unique from the barren deserts to the city of Alexandria, all locations have a different feel and ambience. The world is also full of activities for you to keep you busy like outposts to loot, tombs to raid and treasures to find.

The soundtrack differs from calm ambient music that is fitting for exploration to energetic music that pumps you up from for the combat.

Speaking of combat the parry and attack system is gone, now we have a hitbox style of combat that resembles the Dark Souls series. While the animations are rough in the edges, it finally adds some challenge that the series needed.

The side missions or this time around side quests are more open ended and you can tackle them whenever and however you like, also it is a good way for you to gain XP all the while you get to experience different stories and mysteries to solve.

Also it's worth mentioning two large activities : the hippodrome and the gladiator arena where you challenge yourself in tournaments that test your skills in chariot racing and combat respectively.

To sum it up its safe to say that Assassin's Creed Origins it's a solid title that will bring back to the series old players and also bring new players to the series. The game is beautiful from start to finish and that shows how much work the developers put into it.

I give it 9.0/10 and you should definitely give it a try.

P.S. Don't mess with the hippos.

After Completing the main story campaign and the hidden ones dlc i must its a good game , Recently i have also purchased Odyssey but it is very much different from odyssey but both of the games are a must to have if u are a AC series fan like me , I only skipped AC 3 and Syndicate back to the review I enjoyed it pretty much still i have to complete Curse of the Pharoahs but i have kept that DLC on hold as i am currently completing AC odyssey which is another HUGE game like this one plenty of stuff to do Outposts , Hidden Treasures , Animals to kill , Monuments to discover .

Arenas with champions to kill it a huge pass time of a game if you are a open world fan yeah, it has some grind in it if u play it as a loyalist but if u want to go rogue you can use a trainer as i did legendary weapons cost to much of coins in game approx 4500 and you get only 3 to 4 if u loot missions give some money along with treasure . Pyramids are a good site to see and explore and desert to ride your horse in . Overall its a fun game and good pass time if you want some me time aka Play Single Player games only as i did because i got bored of playing Destiny 2 and Division 2 over and over so i bought this and later Odyssey and i have not been disappointed. You won't as well i give it a 5/5. PS - Just ignore the grammar :)

If you hate the Assassin's Creed formula, you're not going to like this one either. If you like it, this is going to be delicious. It's not a revolution, but it is a step forward. Best Assassin's Creed since the second one and Black Flag, and I've played them all. Biggest negative is probably that some parts of the story feel slightly rushed.

I'm running a GTX 970 and an i7 2600k, and the game runs at 60 frames in the wilderness, with drops to around 45 frames in the larger cities. Performance is fine, though not stellar. Looks beautiful, though. No major bugs encountered either - game seems polished.

Totally worth it for Ubisoft to take a year off, all in all.

The game is just beautiful. I love the game play; the characters and the story line. The open world is truest huge and it feels alive with all those little side quests and details. The combat is different yet satisfying. It might take some time to get used to but it definitely becomes fun once you mastered it.

BUT.... I have to stop the game altogether. Even though It was one of the few games that got me hooked up for hours , I have to stop playing cause it’s pushing my cpu to 100% and its just too risky. This is probably the last time I have ever purchased any Ubisoft game. I gave a long break to this company and thought I can give them one more chance with this game . It’s just disappointing

Best game in its' series. Haven't run into any resource issues, runs just fine on highest settings.
Combat has been refined, and feels wonderful - no more simply parrying to kill everyone.
Weapons styles are all extremely unique - not just appearance.
Mounted combat is actually decent and viable in many situations.
Aim assist is almost necessary in some parts, and they do it well - no one's holding your hand, and you're not fuming from all fo your shots missing by not being able to guess where the enemy will be in 1 second while you're getting gangbanged by a mob of guards.
Story so far is wonderful - love the Egyption atmosphere, and the many places to explore.
The world is HUGE - each one of the 37 (i believe) maps has at least 3-4 hours of playtime before you have done all of the quests and storyline missions. Massive amounts of content that don't seem to repeat, always fresh.
Love the additional content when outside of the animus - characters are new, and well acted.
Spent a couple hours just reading emails and files to catch up on the back story.

Also interesting side content such as ship battles and chariot races that are actually sort of fun.
Crafting system is perfect - nothing is wasted, as everything you upgrade is just.. attached to your character and never replaced.

Well placed boobs, not overdone at all.

Perfect level of tactics and strategy by using your bird.
The hardest difficulty setting makes for a wonderful challenge - anything is Possible, but going head to head against anyone 2+ levels higher than you will be Exremely challenging, and will likely take multiple attempts.

Weapon upgrade system is great - have a favorite weapon? Just spend the money every few levels to keep it at your same level.

Blows my mind how the developers were able to come up with so much unique content in such a short period of time. Well done.

The graphic is great and that's all. After playing Zelda BOTW, The Witcher 3, all I can say is that Ubisoft do something about your quest in game. It's getting real tedious.

It's an okay asscreed game.

Certainly much better than that oddsay crap. At least the combat is properly balanced here, enemies on the same level don't sponge up 2 minutes of attacks before they fall.

Just a comment on the negative performance reviews:

I'm running this game on 2560x1440 with everything on the second highest graphical setting, and a few on ultra, with an old'ish Intel i5-2500K CPU (4 cores). Yes, its at 99% CPU usage all the time, but the game runs absolutely butter smooth. Theres definitely room for improvements and tweaks etc. but sheesh - you don't need a crazy expensive i7 12 cores CPU to run this game!

I'm getting avarage of 82 fps on 2560x1440 with:

64 bit Win 10
i5-2500K (unclocked)
12 gb ram
Nvidia GTX 1080 (unclocked)
SSD disk

On a sidenote, pretty good AC title!

One of the best ACs in my opinion and one of my favourites. Miles better than Odyssey, so if you're going for a recent AC game, buy this.

Egypt is beautifully handcrafted, and incredibly detailed. NPCs all have schedules, the audio design is perfect and it really feels authentic and lived in. This is in no small part to how diverse each biome is: they all feel distinct and provide a new experience, and make exploring really damn fun. Going for 100% completion feels like less of a chore, not just due to the biomes but because every single location you can visit to tick off on the map is enjoyable. This is because each location is individual: no two locations are the same, and that alone just demonstrates how much love was put into this game.

The characters and acting are top notch. Abubakar Salim makes Bayek one of the most relatable and likeable AC protagonists since Ezio. You can hear and feel the rage in the delivery of his lines: two notable examples are the cutscene with Rudjek at the start of the game and later on with one of the targets in the Faiyum. Alix Wilton Regan plays Aya, Bayek's wife, and their chemistry just makes their relationship believable, and more than just a shallow thing. There are other examples, but these two just do such a splendid job.

The gameplay is really fun. The RPG style combat feels fun and satisfying, and can be difficult on the harder difficulties if you don't know what you're doing. But regular enemies don't feel spongey whatsoever, so long as you aren't fighting a level that is miles higher than you. The bosses are of course more spongey - but they're damn good fun. The phylakitai (bounty hunters) you encounter throughout the game are awesome as you can either track them down or they will track you down, sometimes while you're in the middle of a fight or clearing a fort - making you adapt to the situation and making you think as to whether you can afford to face them head or or whether you need to avoid them entirely, and come back to them later. Stealth is also great in this game. It's challenging at times as you can get spotted really easy but it retains it's simplicity and fun, and you really do feel like an assassin clearing an encampment without any detections.

In regards to negatives, the only thing I didn't like was how rushed the story felt for the final few hours. You can tell because of how much effort they put into the rest of the game and the environment, they weren't able to fully polish and refine the final few targets. It feels as if you have no connection to these enemies and one has you wondering as to who the hell they are and where you've seen them before. But I feel this hardly detracts from the rest of the game as a whole, as despite the rushed ending it still delivers a satisfying conclusion.

Should you buy this game? Yes. Absolutely yes.

Wow.

Let's start by saying I am a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed series, and Witcher 3 is my favorite game of all time. Considering this game is like the two had an illegitamate love child, it is freaking amazing to me.

Here is my attempt to articulate why.

-Gameplay

Fantastic. Let's get one thing straight, AC origins is a long game. It took me near 80 hours to finish my first playthrough. Even at hour 79 I was still loving it. Zero boredom, even after I beat the main story and was just clearing the leftover areas of interest I had missed. The combat is good. Sword play is pretty standard, but once you learn some more moves it becomes a little more nuanced than just hack and slash. I really enjoyed the addition of real ranged combat. Not the silly auto aim hold a button to shoot from old games. Real, aim down the "sites", third person shooting. (with bows) The quest structure is great, in addition the the main story lines each section is filled with side quests that help flesh out what is going on. For example, an oppresed area may see you kill the head oppressor, but the side quests will have you helping out the various oppressed people in the area. Fun, varied, engrossing, and well designed.

-Graphics

A stunner. This is, in my opinion, the most gorgeous open world game I have ever played. Maybe even the most gorgeous game period. From the incredibly realistic water to the fire that pops off the screen, as vibrant as real life, this game is stunning. The wind sweeps up the dust that was just kicked up into the air by your footsteps, accurately illimunated by the suns rays. Different pieces of cloth bounce up and down individuily as you run, the layers moving independently yet interconnectedly. The smoke from the fires rises up in the air, some of it more visible/illuminated than other parts depending on if it is in direct sunlight or not. Deep green leaves, colorful foliage, even the golden sand is beautiful. Just gorgeous all around.

-Upgrade System

Man is it nice to have an AC with some character progression and perks to choose. Think FF 15 style upgrades. Branching paths of related perks that increase a certain aspect of your characters abilities. There is a ranged path, hand to hand path, and a "tools" path (smoke bombs that can hurt people, sleep darts, fire bombs, etc) Really gives you a reason to get out there and do every mission for that XP. Also, weapons and armor have perks now, and different levels of quality. This style of loot and character building fit into the AC gameplay loop seamlessly.

-Setting

Ancient Egypt is a really cool place to explore and quest through. From the iconic pyramids to the Library of Alexandria, it is incredible to see famous ancient buildings brouight to life in a convincing manner. They sure did their homework when it comes to what life would have been like back then. You meet well known historical figures, help famous Egyptian "Gods" (or animals they worhipped as Gods), aide roman oracles, all kinds of historically interesting activities. There are tombs to explore, war elephants to kill, landmarks to search for "papyrus riddles"in, all while roman/greek/egyption cultures are clashing in the background. They nailed it here. (I will say the game misses the animus database of previous entries. I have hope this will be fixed with Discovery mode, which should come out soon (early 2018))

So, ya, hopefully this helps someone understand what the game is about and what makes it, in my eyes, so great. I have never made a steam review, but this game was so good it compelled me to.

Good job Ubi, this game is a gem.

87 hours later and i'm still playing this game....(and havent finished the main story)

Runs great on my system (see profile),
Looks gorgeous,
Amazing lore (love ancient Egypt),
So much exploration,
So much to collect to improve kit and gear,
Mounts are a joy to ride,
Side quests really are top notch,

Worth it even though i got it at full price at release :)

Update: The ending and the relationship with Aya turned out to be awesome! ;-)

Product refunded

Don't get me wrong the actual gameplay is alright, and I like the skill tree and such.

The game runs like it was on it's first day of Early Access. The diaglouge volume is completely broken. Volume controls are either 100% or 0%.

Now to get started on the actual problem. The game, just like everyone else, hit's 100% CPU usage and stutters like no other. It's not as bad if it's the only thing I'm running. But if google chrome is open, forget it.

I'm running a water cooled I7-4790k and a MSI 1080 Gaming X, and it's installed on a samsung 850 evo. There is 0 excuse as to why this game is capping out.

I submitted for a refund about 30 minutes ago.

The Witchers Creed: Graphics Demo

This game tries to be too many things and it suffers from it. Stealth is nearly gone. Combat, uncommon as it is, is button mashing even on hard difficulty. Quests are busy work. The story and characters are flat, uninvolving and forgettable. The best part of the game is the graphics. This massive open world looks great, though it also feels empty and lifeless.

It tried to be The Witcher 3 in a lot of areas and came out lacking.

As far as performance, this uses a ton of CPU. Might wanna dust off your fans before running this. Still not sure why the middle of the empty desert takes so much cpu...

Disclaimer: If you ever wanted to play an MMO, but didn't like weird multiplayer experiences like raids, battlegrounds or arena fights, then this game is for you. Don't bother reading my review.

Leveling system makes this otherwise decent game entirely unfun. As an Assassin, I'd like to assassinate my enemies, which is impossible since any enemy 5 levels above me gains enough damage reduction to turn every normal enemy into a Dark Souls boss fight. When you finally do reach that level, you don't deal extra damage, but all enemies suddenly die in 3 hits.

This was by far not the only complaint, others being:
Various bugs like my character freezing up and unable to move, the game crashing on some occasions and major lags when starting the game (this has to be a bug, because it is completely gone after about 2 minutes played).
The fact that this game is best played as a hack and slash instead of an assassin game (use the warrior path. Assassinations simply don't work well enough).
And many more.
But they all would have been fine if the core gameplay was more fun, because the story isn't bad. Sadly that fun is cut short by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ leveling system.

One of the better AC episodes and I love the setting... and my camel lol. but, not surprisingly, it is lifeless without Melissanthi's acting. Play this before you play Odessey and you'll be right.

Only game I have played that crashes all the time. Multiple people have reported this for the last few years and I am playing for first time in 2021 and still no fix. The game finally crashed during a save and my "One" save, since that's all you get with Ubisoft, is completely corrupted and crashes on launch. After many communication exchanges with customer service, not only were they not able to fix this or do anything other than tell me to start over, they also refused any refund or exchange. If game developer says Ubisoft, I will pass from now on. Lesson learned.

I was burned out on AC titles for a while and Syndicate just couldn't hold my attention.
AC: Origins is refreshing, immersive and alive. I haven't been taken away by the scale of a game in a while but this does it.

Tbh, I've always been a huge fan of the AC series, despite that, I did not expect to receive such joy and pleasure from the gameplay. I found AC Origins a true masterpiece and 99 hours spent are not gonna lie. I bought the golden edition of the game and yeah, it is worth the money.

This is my new favorite in the series now.
Story is quite intriguing and the score matches it perfectly. The new "RPG elements" actually fit the gameplay. Bayek and Aya's personality and charisma (and their voice actors) makes them a perfect match as the first of the assassins.
Eagle vision is a literal eagle vision now, and I'm quite impressed with that. Senu is the best.
Siwa, naval battles, secret tombs, endless deserts, the Nile, roman and greek influence in Egypt, this game probably couldn't be any better.

It seems Ubisoft has learnt a lot from CD Project. This game resembles The Witcher 3 in a lot of ways. Its like turning the character from a witcher to an assassin.
The story-telling of this game can hardly compare to TW3, but we all know better than to expect a rich and memorable story from the AC series. Just ignore the story and focus on exploring, collecting, and killing.
Exploring and traffic systems are good, mounts run real fast, saving a lot of time on the road. The eagle provides a nice recon in case players cannot find collectibles.
Except assassinating, there are other activities including the arena and chariot races. Naval battles are awesome, but only appears several times in the main story. It took me around 70 hours to fully complete the game.
The map is huge. Game contents are richer than TW3. Although the price is higher(either on sale or not), I think it's worth it.
There is not much emphasis on stealth in this game. A sophisticated ARPG player can rush openly into fights and prevail in most cases. To old-school AC fans this might be not desirable.
If you do not care much about the story and tend to skip cut-scenes and dialogues, this is definitely your game.

Assassin's Creed: Origins


Origins is the first game after Ubisoft's soft-reboot of the franchise


Pros

- A huge and visually stunning map; the best I've seen (Aside from Odyssey)
- Dynamic combat which isn't as ability-focused as in Odyssey
- One of the best main characters in the series
- Parkour is intuitive and fun, especially in the forts
- Lots of stuff to go around and complete in Egypt
- Modern day story is finally back with a protagonist who is not a nameless drone

Cons:

- Can be grindy at times, but you won't have to do too much
- Pacing of the main story is jittery; the final part of the game has a large unspecified time skip
- Social stealth has sadly been removed, although the rest of the stealth is as fun as ever

Is it an RPG?

Yes, the introduction of levels and crafting mean that AC: Origins is very much an RPG; but these are still fun and engaging.


Verdict:
9/10

Get ready for good exploration and awesome story driven adventure. i really recommend this game for everyone. you can explore, hunt, stalk, kill, upgrade, even be a fashion model and dress up with new outfit if your old dress stinks with crocodile blood. there is drama there is love, a lot of different feelings mixed up in game. What are you waiting for? go and prove yourself that you are true hidden one!

After having lost interest in Assassin's Creed after Black Flag, this game has renewed my interest in the franchise. I feel like the series had run a bit stale for a while and I think AC: Origins injected some much needed new life into the Assassin games.

I feel like it has gotten increasingly difficult for AAA games to really make a large open world a dense and fulfilling experience to explore. It seems like there has always been a drive to make bigger maps but not as big a drive to actually fill the maps with content. This game does a pretty good job without overwhelming the player either. In fact, large stretches of desert regions are free of side quests and encampments that the player can choose to explore, with varying degrees of reward for doing so. But even if one were to discount these regions, you are still left with an impressively large and diverse landscape.

I was skeptical at first of setting an open world game in a desert environment, but they really went above and beyond in capturing Egypt and making each region of the map feel unique, unlike previous installments where most areas were indistinguishable from one another with all their copy & pasted resources. They really put an extraordinary amount of effort into reconstructing ancient landmarks and wonders as they would have appeared in the decades leading up to the birth of the Roman Empire. Getting to interact with the likes of Cleopatra was certainly a surprise as well.

On a side note, I think its really cool that they added an educational "tour" mode where you can just walk around places like Alexandria and learn about it all. I don't think I've ever really seen AAA game do anything like that before.

Back on the subject of the game itself, I also thoroughly enjoyed the story of Bayek & Aya and their quest for revenge. I think their relationship was handled very well throughout the game without giving in to tropes too much. And it was equally interesting to see the origins of the Assassin's brotherhood to begin with, that basically being the premise of the game. There is a pretty large cast of characters you meet along the way, including many famous characters from that time period.

My only complaint with the story, and this is one of the drawbacks of the current popular open world game format, is that you can get so bogged down with side quests and exploring and a million other things that at times you kind of lose track of what's happening in the main story. It would be nice to have the main story arc be a little bit more involved with the game as a whole, as the bulk of the gameplay is in the side quests and exploration. And as good as some of the side quests are, it does get a little bit repeatitive to go into some encampment, rescue a prisoner, and then find out that they stole some scroll which is being kept in another encampent, and yatta yatta yatta. It's not really story so much as Bayek doing his job as Medjay. And that's all well and good and is enjoyable enough, I just think the game weighed too much of its gameplay on the side stuff compared to the main storyline.

Also, I suppose another complaint I would have is that the modern day story is completely forgettable, but its such a small part of the game, its easily overlooked.

Speaking of gameplay, no complaints what so ever. The combat is fantastic with a wide variety of weapons for different fighting styles but almost all of which very satisfying. If I'm being honest, out of many similar games, I think this has some of the best hack & slash style melee combat mechanics of any open world game I've played. It really puts the old AC games to shame. The closest comparison I would draw is Witcher 3, but this game's system is a little simpler. It still has the tried and true assassinate mechanics with the hidden blade and all that, but sometimes I just stuck to my varies bows, swords and spear. Skill tree was also cool and offered some interesting combo unlocks that added a fun RPG layer of progression to the game.

I told myself going in: "Okay, it's another Assassin's Creed game, which means it's way more content than what can hold your interest, so don't try to 100% complete it." Well, nearly 80 hours later during the unexpected sudden increase in free time during the Covid-19 pandemic, I ended up completing all the quests and locations, the gladiator challenges and the chariot races. And I thoroughly enjoyed it.

By the way, if you don't want to bother with the old AC games, which are probably getting a bit dated now, this is a perfectly good game to start from, since in a sense, this is really starting from the beginning. And the Modern Day story arc is irrelevant enough to previous titles that you aren't missing much plot there either.

Basically, if you are a fan of open world games with melee combat I highly recommend AC: Origins! And on top of that, AC franchise aside, I can't think of another video game that really brings Ancient Egypt to life in the way that this game does.

Assassin's Creed® Origins
So far this is the best game in the Assassin’s Creed series.
Combat is awesome, stealth is awesome, exploration is amazing and the story is great.

I highly recommend this game.

Great experience, great improvement from the last generation of AC. The RPG elements are well put together. I've had some problems with Uplay and Ubisoft Support, but that's the risk you take.

Horribly optimized game, I run Odyssey on max everything no lag WHAT SO EVER. I come over to give origins a try and it stutters so much! i have messed with everything to try and fix the stutter but nothing has helped. Its really sad because it looks to be such a great game. Its a real shame to have it ruined because of optimization. I have gone down to medium graphics, still nothing, messed with Vsync, nothing, messed with Nvidia optimization and nothing, messed with the priority of the game through windows and still nothing. SHAME!

This game is tedious. I usually finish games before I review them, but the story of this game is so lame and nearly all of the missions were not fun at all. The combat is awful and it feels like a game from 2006. The characters are not interesting at all. And the main character can't even climb stairs properly. The only things that are not bad about this game are the graphics and the map. 4/10

If I am to call this the best Assassin's Creed I ever played it would be the honest truth. I have spent over 200 hours on the game, removing the fact that I had several times crashes, problems with Uplay that ruined my save, and whatnot, this game for me was an enjoyment.

I loved the setting, I am a huge fan of Egyptian history, and location wise was amazing.

The story was magnificent and the voice actor who did Bayek is by far one of the best voice actors I've heard in a long time. I can feel every time when he was passionated about his son and his desire to make a change and this speaks a lot through the writing of the story. I don't wanna spoil the game as it is worth playing 100%. It does feel like you're something else than an Assassin until the very end when you form the Brotherhood and you play the Hidden Ones DLC.

The Hidden Ones despite being a very short DLC, it felt like a pure blessing and a return to the true origin of the game, I finally felt I am part of a creed and I am working to build it. I honestly enjoyed it.

On the other hand, The Curse of the Pharaoh was interesting and beautiful settings, but it really disconnected me from the real world that was presented in the game and I honestly made me not enjoy it so much. It's not that it isn't good, but I feel the game becomes a little too SCFI for my own taste when it comes to Assassin's Creed. It makes sense for me the alien race to contact you through the whole process, but it felt like it makes no sense for magic and mythical beings to exist in the same time of the Egyptian period when Bayek was around. It just had a werid twist, but never the less, an interesting experience.

Last but not least, the game had this Exploration system that allows you to learn about Ancient Egypt, Rome and Greek, which was amazing. I loved it.

In conclusion, the game is worth playing 100% and I can't stress this enough how much I enjoyed it. I am glad I spend this amount of time to finish it as I really like the franchise and I look forward to seeing what the next Assassin's Creeds have to offer.

Just over 100 hours in this game and it's fair to say that it's a good game to play. I bought this game on sale with both the DLC's. It's a great game when it comes to visuals. The ancient Egypt landscape is beautiful and I loved exploring the massive open world this game has to offer. The main story is a bit lackluster but it's alright. The two DLC's are also a fair bit of content added to your game time. All in all, I 100% the game and got all the achievements.

Damn. Just damn. What a great ♥♥♥♥♥♥' game. Everything from music, to voice acting, to narration, just damn. These are the standards that other AC titles should aspire to reach. They only needed one game to fully make players immersed with Bayek, when they needed four games to immerse players with Ezio. Everything was perfect and pristine, and as an AC fan since the first game's initial release, I have absolutely no complaints and this is definitely my new personal favorite AC game of the franchise. Just amazing what Ashraf's team did here.

Mechanic-wise a great improvement in the Assassin's Creed series!
Movement isn't as clunky as it was in the previous entries (though not as good as Odyssey).

The game doesn't really portray you as an assassin (yet? Haven't completed the game at time of review), but as a Medjay, a title of someone who serves Pharaoh and Egypt - and enjoys the respect of all.

Story was a little lacklustre and shallow, and felt a bit rushed to me.
The modern day also doesn't interest me at all like it did with the original AC Trilogy. I never went to modern day of my own accord.

What I did enjoy:
- the main character, Bayek, and his badass wife, Aya.
- the type of music they composed for this title.
- the RPG-esque element that they've introduced, which isn't overdone at all; just right.
- bow and arrow gameplay

This one is skipable, in my opinion.
Bought it on special. Recommend it on special.

Came to AC:Origins after a recent completionist run of AC:Odyssey figuring it would just be more of the same, and boy was I wrong! I really liked Odyssey, but for me (this is subjective, of course), AC:Origins was far superior in almost every way, with only a few exceptions. The experience was much more focused, with the story, quests and the environment feeling far more hand crafted and organic overall. The tombs, quests and geography had much more variety and uniqueness when comparing with Odyssey. I also generally preferred the sound design, music, and look of the world in Origins. The more somber tone of the music and environmental color palette were spot on, capturing the atmosphere of ancient Egypt well.

AC:Odyssey was certainly fun, but it suffered somewhat from quantity over quality, where the environment and quests had a bit too much repetitious generic design. However, a few aspects of Odyssey were certainly better, or at least improved over Origins. The combat and character control were much smoother and less janky than Origins. There's a manual save system allowing multiple saves (Origins has an auto-save system). The skill tree and upgrade system in Odyssey were also a lot better and more interesting. And finally, although I found I liked the look & design of the world in Origins better, you have to give Odyssey the edge for overall graphical fidelity, which was just fantastic.

In any case, both are really nice games. Which one you prefer may come down to the kind of game experience you like. Origins is more of a focused "play an existing character's story" approach, whereas Odyssey is more open ended. For me though, the choice is easy, hands down it goes to AC:Origins.

The game though different from the standard Assassin's creed games is still a rather enjoyable experience .
Of course as any game on the market it has it's pluses and minuses.

+ The open world is indeed extremely beautiful and has a lot of variety .
+ The overall graphics are great and so is the lighting
+ The main story is mostly interesting
+ The more rpg style of the game suits it nicely

- The sidequests even though they are improved there is still a share of boring quests
- The game at times can be buggy (especially the chariot and the dead bodies)
- Some quests are not only boring but also annoying.

I've never played an AC release till Origins and it blew my mind. If you love History, Mythology and Lore, this one is a must. You choose how you play, set it up for stealth, go in and let them know youre there, or pick your targets off from a distance, Egypt is yours to devour.

There are many people who don't like the new Assassin's Creeds because it is changing too much. (RPG direction)
Personally, I didn't like the old Acs until I bought Ac Origins.
It's a very successful game with about 70-80 hours playing time + DLCs another 20 hours at least.
Beautiful graphics and no bugs worth mentioning.
Especially interesting is the photo mode, make sure to test it!

Got the Gold Edition on sale for $65, so when reading keep in mind that I definitely would NOT pay full price for this game and its DLCs.

After over 200 hours of active play, I can say that this AC game is like no others in the series. Completely changed equipment system, upgrade system, new abilities, drastically redesigned open combat, and so much more, I've managed to boil it all down to some pros and cons.

Pros

Awesome revamped combat system
Interesting and compelling story
Reasonably done loot/equipment system
Incredible amounts of quests and locations to complete. After having completed both the main story and the dlcs, I'm still at least a couple dozen hours from completing every location in the world.
Truly well done quests and locations. Some are challenging. Others frustrating. Some are emotionally draining gut punches (I'm talking about Hulk-smashing-Loki-like-a-rag-doll kind of hits here). This game has some of the best quests/memories I've seen in the entire franchise.
Thoughtful and believable backstory to the universe that we know and love
New and unique abilities and skills, mostly fitting with the time period
Hacking the Animus! There's a reasonable array of features that you can alter in order to play the game in a different/unique way. Not as extensive or as many features that you can edit as you might wish, but enough that you can have fun with them and get at least another few hours of gameplay out of them.
Fun way of pseudo multiplayer, by way of having pictures be broadcast to the internet, as well as allowing other players to "avenge" and being able to "avenge" your death and the deaths of others respectively.

Cons

Hidden blade does not auto-kill when fully upgraded in main game
Stealth system is poorly done with no skills increasing it, worthwhile incentives rewarding it, or otherwise encouraging stealth and strategy other than not being mobbed by dozens of enemies in enemy laden areas
NO MEMORY REPLAY! You would think that the game franchise whose biggest, most iconic feature is to allow players to replay quests they enjoy as many times as they want, would keep that feature in their newest game. Nope. They added new game plus recently, but still no replaying individual memories/quests that you enjoy. While better than nothing, I don't want to have to grind through the first third of the game again before getting to the really cool/interesting/fun quests.
No way to earn helix credits in game. While in other games the helix credits just made life easier, here they do that and unlock legendary equipment that is impossible to find elsewhere. If you're going to do the second part, at least give us missions/challenges/nigh-impossible goals that will allow the dedicated and/or cheap players to unlock everything without spending ridiculous amounts of money for a game we already bloody bought.

Summary
If you can get it on sale, or the entire game + DLCs for 50% off or more, I would definitely reccomend it. Compared with others in the franchise, it's truly amazing and an improvement in a wide array of areas. The biggest thing for me, is the lack of ability to replay missions/quests/memories over again without grinding through the game again. If they added/fixed that one problem, I'd be willing to bump my reccomendation up to it being worthwhile to buy with just 20-25% off.

Overall, a solid 8.4/10, with points taken off for all of the above reasons. If the biggest issues were fixed (memory replay and helix credits) then I'd give it a 9.5/10 as it really is just that good, and just that much fun.

Assassin's Creed Origins has done a lot to differentiate itself from prior entires in the series, and I found that most of it was a renounding success.

The new combat system feels way more dynamic and large than any other Assassin's Creed title, but it still manages to keep that spectacle.

Egypt is a beautiful and different breath of fresh air, and the story is as fun as its always been.

The level requirements to do the main quest coupled with some boring side quests keep it from being as amazing as I wanted it to be, but it was still one great experience.

previous Assassins Creed's game is just confusing and boring, never be able to go through the first 30 minutes, but this one get me 3 hour+ on my first play time, so I guess this game is okay, might as well finish it I guess.

Graphic is gorgeous, gameplay is smooth, stealth is okay, battle system is engaging, story is okay, voice acting is okay, recommended to buy it on steam sale.

This game has really performed well. The graphics are really great including the combat system,climbing,stealth,swimming,leap of faith, and the landscape's.
It's a must play for the assassin's creed fans out there, just get the Altair or Ezio outfit and it should be good^^
I really liked the temples that you could explore and discover. It makes it more fun to have more things to do :) Dont tell me that im wrong Ubisoft ;) But please remember that if you use the picture mode and take picture of the animals and children, use the the gray and make it look like an old photo xD

Out of all the Assassin's Creed game I have played this one has to be the most complicated and deep. The game is great if you have the kind of rig that can handle it (suggest you examine the PC requirements before buying). This Creed is very deep in story(even in side quests), offers gear crafting which adds to its complexity and longevity to the game, and also has a very different combat system from the other Creeds. You will also see the origin of important components of what makes an assassin, an assassin. Iv'e been seeing a lot of comments of those who don't feel comfortable because of the rituals performed in this game, well beware there are ALOT of spiritistic/ritual type settings throughout this game (they aren't light senses either/plus it IS themed in Egypt.)So if you think you might be offended, then you might want to think twice about buying the game. Other than that its an awesome game, decked out in gold! Should deffinately try it if you are up for the rich history of the Assassin's Creed <3

This is where Ubisoft first started their attempt in revamping the Assassin's Creed franchise. This was the last game worthy of the "AC" name imo. Odyssey and Valhalla were good games, but they were in no sense Assassin's Creed games.

Anyway, I liked AC Origins for the most part. Some of the RPG elements that the game introduced into this series were good, ancient Egypt was fun to explore. And the game was able to make me care about Bayek's family and his story overall.

What a game indeed, as all the reviews already suggest... this is one of the best Assassins creed games out there, the sequel definitely needed a refresh and as such it has gotten one.. and a really great one.

If you are an Assassins creed fan or not, this game is a must play.

I love that atmosphere. The most beauty is just to walk through the landscape and enjoying everything. The romantic sound of the cracking burning military camp in your back, a snorring cat to your feet, you see the fantastic lake in front of you and have in mind: to this pyramide in the very far i will climb up and surf it down.

This game is amazing I'm still early on but have enjoyed every minute the new combat is great, leveling up your character and having a skill tree is done well, besides you most likely need to play a lot of side quest to get up to recommend level for that mission besides that the visuals are great and great characters and its definitely a good game to get right now on sale

Good Assassin's Creed game up to date. And I finished this game 100% (except for the achievements)

The reinvented combat is fun and creative to play, although some weapon's stats are still useless and the armors does not do anything beside looking good.

Not require to be stealthy in every mission, but encourage player to be. To compare: AC Syndicate force player to play their boring and lengthy steathy game (usually with Jacob, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ steath assassin).

Good acting in every moment. The story is great too, except for the last part.

One of the best Assassin's Creed games ever.

If you played previous games before this one, you might be a little confused, because Origins looks and plays completely different. Previous games were more like action adventure and this one is action RPG, I think that some people might not like it, but I loved it..

I have a unicorn. I am amused.

I have loved assassins creed games since I first started playing them (assassins creed 3). This one is just the next level of amazing. I love the hunting and interactive parts with the animals. The fact you can get a camel or a horse as your trusty steed but also that there is an ability to TAME ANIMALS. If you LOVE having a fellow companion to bring into fights as you explore the map, this is just a great feature, reminds me of Far Cry.

Other things about it... I just love the story, Bayek of Siwa seeking revenge of those who caused his son's death. A loving but dangerous woman he is married to (i think owo). And the two who continue the animus project in a hidden cave in a desert! Just amazing gameplay and even the weapons are amazing. (I suggest any predator bow for extraaa accuracy!)

9/10 Mechanics
10/10 Visuals
7/10 Main Quest (way too small, good thing they have tons of side quests plus some new DLC's coming up)

Overall I highly recomend this game! Even though you never played an AC game before or haven't enjoyed it. This is, like they say, a new beginning. One of the best aspects is that you can simply explore Egypt. Secrets, hidden stuff, the monuments... there are so many stuff out there to explore.

On the other hand, let's be honest, it doesn't feel like AC anymore BUT still, very enjoyable. Its new stealthy mechanics and direct combat is very nice and smooth, you can dodge, attack, parry, overcharge attack, charge with your shield, many many stuff. You have sh** tons of weapons which is good, you can be agressive, defensive you can even prefer attack speed instead of an overcharge attack. There is just a large variety of weapons.

Origins now have become on of my Top fav List, I have almost every Single Assassins Creed game xD Never enjoyed like this one since from a long old Assassins Creed game. Story i found little bit short, if you keep doing like that, without doing anything further. You have force level system, you have to Level up your Player, or You might die Instantly within secs after high Levels attack you. Story is great, Graphics are awesome, there are many every single details, they really worked great in terms of Graphics wise. There is a Performance issue, but fix little bit after this new update, still there is, when you visit a City type area such as Allexandra, fps goes like 25 :/ and for other parts it remains stable 60+

Once you start the game, you will loved to gave more time in your own, just to build more.

and the Side quests are so many, it will extend your another extra time, which you will loved that too, also every activity you do, you will get more XP.

Definitely one of the best installments in the series. They finally fixed the combat system, the story is solid, and the setting is just to die for. The world is MASSIVE. I've spent probably around 40+ hours just exploring the open world so far and I've still got about 10% of locations to hit up. Definitely worth your time and money.

Exactly the change this series needed. The gameplay mechanics will be very familiar to old fans but, AC: Origins makes more than enough additions and changes to make the game feel fresh without being extremely glitchy or feeling repetative. It's crazy. I'm no game publisher but, giving a game an appropriate amount of development time seem to be beneficial to the overall quality of the product! Weird.

I have been playing the Assassin's Creed series for many years and this is by far the best realease in the series.


Where do I begin. The game uses a new mechanics system and already this makes the game so much better, my favourite part is the auto sprint and crouch features which make the game a lot simpiler in a way. Plus they have a new addition of the bows. There has always been a pistol or something along those lines at hand, but the bow is a real necesity where as the pistol was just something you used to get some quicker kills. Another excellent aspect is the campaign. The campagin draws you in as the "Assassin's Creed" series usually does, but the campagin in this game doesn't dissapoint with the awesome story and the enjoyable memories. Another execellent feature is the "Mount" feature. The mount feature allows you to call a ride from anywhere anytime, you can choose between the horse (the faster option) or the camel (the stronger option) to take you and help you around the whole map and through your epic adventure. My next favourite feature is the "Senu" feature. Senu is a bird that you can call in to be your eyes in the sky. Senu will help you find the objective, collectibles, resources/animals and even loot chests. Plus as you progress Senu can even harass and distract the enemies for you so you can get a cheeky assasination or get one step closer to your objective. My final favourite feature has to be the graphics. This game defiantly has hit the bullseye with the graphics capabilities. I run the game with a GTX 1080 and a 4K monitor and I have never seen an assassin's creed game look or feel better. With vibrant colours and awesome blood affects might I add, this is a beautiful game. I get a stable 60-200 fps on highest graphics settings and 4K. Overall this game is a perfect addition to the series.

Assassins creed origins is a great game.

World:
This game is in Egypt while the brother of Cleopatra is farao, it's open world and there is much to do.

Details:
The game is historical accurate, except roman soldiers loadout... But give the devs some artistic freedom.

Gameplay:
It's mechanics are good, far LOS because the rendering is amazingly done. The controls can be a bit difficult at first, but it won't take long to master them. The level up and upgrade system is great in my opinion. While you're getting to the maximum level, you'll need to spend points carefully on upgrades to suit your playstyle.

Lore, quest and story:
The storyline is good, I'm not going to spoil it. The quests can be redundant and boring, but there are enough quests. The lore is just the history of the old Egypt and the background of Bayek, so not much to do wrong there.

Combat:
The combat is really refreshing, normally the assassins creed games are mostly focussed on stealth. This game gives you the choice: stealth or open combat. The weapon selection is great, although the power creep of some weapons kills the diversity.

Minigames:
There are two types of minigames: arena and chariotrace. Arena is quiet funny and challenging to do, but I dislike the chariotraces... The chariotraces are insanely difficult to do and just like arena there is a more difficult challenge to play.

Additional:
The devs try to keep the game alive and I am very thankful for that, but I am a little bit twisted inside about microtransactions... In free to play games I do not mind microtransactions, but when I payed good money for a game and they still ask for more money outside of dlcs I feel my blood starting to boil...

Conclusion:
This game deserves a 9.5/10, but microtransactions and the chariots brought it down to 8.5 in my opinion...
So my final review is 8.5/10 for Assassins creed origins.

I've played all of the Assassin's Creed games up to AC3 and then I just stopped playing. After hearing the good reviews for Origins I decided to try it again. Oh man, it was worth it. Egypt is beautiful, the lore is top notch, and there is so much to do.

Restored my faith in the AC Series.

Whats good about this game?
A beautiful story with a beautiful environment. RPG style story, I'm glad its inspired probably by the Witcher 3. The side missions are fun and levelling up isnt that bad compared with witcher.
You gotta grind to play the story as most require a good high level to play but its definitely fun to do the side missions. Players have to craft gear as well and I love the variety of options we have for combat. Theres spears clubs and crazy stuff enough for everyone's favourite preference. Plenty of land to explore, plenty of side missions to do, and its really fun to play!

I've played every AC game and after Black Flag this was the only game that I'm enjoying a lot. The story is wonderfully written and the endings gave me goosebumps with the new Ezios Family music.
Bayeks story is a quest for revenge and it feels great to meet the iconic historical characters.
Sync spots are also not bad, earlier it used to be "sync or no vision on map!!" Now its much better.

They've thought about a lot of minor details in the game such as guard rounds and desert illusions.
Graphics are absolutely stunning and the draw distance is probably the best I've ever seen in a game. I’m glad Ubi kept their promise and didn't downgrade anything much this time.

Whats bad about this game?
The denuvo + vmprotect DRM ♥♥♥♥ which takes some hit on performance and leading to dropped framerates in cities.

Kudos Ubisoft you finally made a hell of a game!

Overall rating 8/10

I've gone back and forth numerous times on how to review Assassin's Creed: Origins. On one hand, when it works, it's an excellent game, possibly the best in the series. This despite being a drastic deviation from the "classic" Assassin's Creed formula, which had honestly become quite stale in recent years.

Changing the game to be more of an open world light RPG with loot mechanics ended up being a really good idea, because the gameplay feels fresh again, while still maintaining some of that Assassin's Creed feel. There's a buttload of content, both side missions and main missions, and especially the side missions are really imaginative, fun and varied.

The world is also really good. It looks gorgeous and is full of interesting stuff to explore and just look at. Heck, they're patching in a non-combat mode where you can just casually explore the world for historical purposes, and that kinda tells you all you need to know. To me, the world alone is almost worth the purchase.

All that being said, the PC version is not amazing. It's got a ton of different settings and options you can tweak, but none that solve the real problems the version has. I first started playing on a Core I5-4670K system and the game ran like a turd. Every time I got into a city, the framerate would plummet to the low 20s or even below, and frankly that's unacceptable. But hey, you can always upgrade your system, right? Well, now I'm running a Core I7-8700 with a GTX 1080 and the fastest consumer SSD you can buy, and the game STILL runs poorly! Not as poorly as before, because now my CPU doesn't always hit 100% usage, but instead hovers around 91-93% most of the time. The game stutters, the framerate fluctuates wildly and occasionally this will actively impact gameplay, because the combat is fast and reaction based and when your framerate is pogoing between 20 and 60, that's not a great combination.

So, do I give the game a thumbs down because performance this poor (especially performance that's apparently caused by DRM run rampant) is not acceptable and publishers need to learn that they can't dump on paying customers in an effort to protect their bottom lines? Or do I give the game a thumbs up, because hidden under those technical problems and bad management decisions is one of the best games of 2017? I guess I'd rather give a thumbs up to a creative team that did amazing work than a thumbs down to a management team who need to pull their heads out of whatever orifices they're stuck in.

I feel the combat here is alot better than the arkam style combat style, because it gave a challenge to every encounter. It also works into the whole, proto-assassins aspect. Huge open world of ancient egypt to explore, and even allows to venture into the tombs and lairs.

An extremely well-made game, probably the best I've played in a while.
Vivid world, stunning graphics, smooth gameplay, engaging story, amazing historical accuracy.
The level of attention they pay to the littlest detail really blew my mind.
and the screenshot system is amazing, I can literally spend all day taking screenies in this game.
Plenty things to do postgame if you are a completionist.
I honestly don't have anything negative to say about this game. 10/10

I have an average game completion rate of 17% on Steam. That's actually quite embarrassing, but I mention it only because I just completed Assassin's Creed Origins. It's rare for me to really finish a single player game. For whatever reason, I tend to get into games like this early on, but when the mid-game grind starts rolling in I typically lose interest.

That wasn't so much the case with this game. I played about 37 hours before rolling the credits. That is uncharacteristic of me, which should speak to the quality of this game. Taking a year off in the development cycle seemed to pay dividends to Ubisoft here. I have not experienced such a vibrant open world in a game for some time. In fact, the world they have created here is easily in league with the likes of Skyrim and The Witcher 3, if not better. That's not to say the story or game mechanics are superior, rather it's just a comment on the quality of the open world. Ancient Egypt feels alive, atmospheric, and it begs to be explored. The Assassin's Creed style of traversal, with all its climbing and free running, lends itself well to the setting. Whether you love or hate the franchise, I don't think there is really any denying that the game environment here is a huge win.

As for the combat, I found it almost as satisfying as the exploration. I found myself being tempted to engage entire camps of enemies at times, rather than cautiously picking at the weak spots of an enemy outpost slowly and methodically, as the series namesake would suggest. Taking a stealthy approach was just as satisfying though, which I felt kept the game very fresh from a combat perspective. The combat itself is akin to a faster paced Dark Souls style, though not quite as deep. You'll face enemies with different capabilities and you'll need to be adaptable to succeed. At times, the game will force you to engage various groups of enemies or bosses in combat without a reasonable option of taking a stealthy approach. Other times, you may find yourself pouncing on a major enemy from the shadows, swiftly eliminating the threat while the only danger is being seen. The choice is really yours, and being able to play most of the encounters either way kept things interesting for me.

Then we come to the story. Here's where I have some mixed feelings. Because of the adoption of RPG elements, I found the urgency of some of the major story elements to be rather unbelievable. What I mean is that you'll be hot on the heels of an enemy who has done you an injustice, your character seething for revenge. A near miss, and he escapes. But there's a lead - he's gone to a town somewhere across the map and you'll need to go scout the area to try and find him. Thus one quest is complete, and you're issued the next quest in the chain. However, the next quest is above your suggested level, and suddenly all the baddies in his entourage are a few levels higher. They're firmly out of your reach now, as you can only effectively take out enemies about 2 levels above your current level. You may not even be able to assassinate enemies, rather you'll perform a "stealth attack," which takes a large portion of their health but they'll still react and potentially alert the rest of the camp. Granted, you may not want to rush through the story and perhaps you'll enjoy this pacing. I found myself wanting to know what would happen next, and felt disappointed when I had to open my map and search for adequately leveled quests to take on until I caught up enough in levels. This happened on numerous occasions. With that being said, many of the side quests lead to great rewards, and are great experiences in and of themselves. They tried to take some influence here from The Witcher 3, and it's made the overall experience much better. The stories still aren't nearly as good as The Witcher 3, but that's setting the bar extremely high. Let's just say you won't be bored out of your mind with side quests, and leave it at that.

Now, I purchased this game on the PC rather than console for a higher framerate and some better effects. I knew that the PC version was reported to have issues, and I experienced first hand that it does. It took me quite a while to figure out that the game is completely incompatible with surround sound options enabled on my Logitech G933 headset. By opening the Logitech Gaming Software application and setting it to stereo sound only, the problem was solved. It took me quite a while to find that solution though. I did experience some random bugs throughout my 37 hours, but nothing game breaking. I would expect Ubisoft to fix these issues eventually, but if given the choice again I would still stick with the PC version. I played it with both a Playstation 4 controller and an Xbox One controller, and found both these options to be superior to the keyboard and mouse. The combat was much more satisfying and movement felt more precise.

As an aside, I feel the need to mention the micro-transactions. I am upset to see the gaming industry gravitate so heavily towards liberal use of micro-transactions in fully pay to play titles, especially at the premium price point. I will say that in this particular case, it seems to be a very fair system. The real temptation would be to purchase crafting materials in order to avoid the mindless grinding of "hunting animals" in the game. To max out your gear, you'll spend a considerable amount of time fighting wildlife. It's not the most exciting thing in the world, and the temptation to skip some of that is great. Otherwise, the thing you should know is that there is no actual armor in the game. You'll use crafting materials to give yourself a flat increase to various stats, such as ranged damage, melee damage, health, carrying capacity for arrows, etc. None of these "items" shown on the inventory menu have any in-game appearance. Your weapon will have its own appearance, but your "armor" provides stats and your "outfit" provides an appearance. You don't really earn many outfits through simply questing, and you may get very bored of the way you look when your appearance doesn't change throughout the entire game. There's another temptation to succumb to the micro-transactions. The game balances this somewhat with a daily quest system which has the chance of rewarding random legendary items, though they're usually swords. Other high level quests give you certain outfits which are pretty cool as well, but while you're going through the main story of the game just be aware that you won't be able to access these yet. Just something to think about.

For my final thoughts, I will say that I do highly recommend this game. It's not "the complete package" in the way that games like The Witcher 3 or Breath of the Wild were. By this, I mean this game isn't really changing the industry and it doesn't hit the nail on the head in every category. It has an extremely rich and vibrant open world that feels alive and worth exploring. It has combat and stealth elements that entertain throughout. It has a story that is worth playing through and side quests which are usually pretty enjoyable. The game lacks character development for most characters aside from the main protagonist, who also isn't terribly interesting. I didn't really mind though, because I wasn't expecting this to be truly epic when it came to the story. With all this being considered, I would say it's worth paying full price and you should experience it. Be warned, it gets off to a somewhat slow start. Push through it, give it an honest 6 hours or so to start, and I believe the vast majority of you will find some enjoyment in it.

That's my two cents, I hope it helps someone make the decision. Thanks for reading.

I gotta say, At first I thought it'll be a failure like Unity and Syndicate because you know it's Ubisoft but Assassin's Creed Origins turned out to be way better than what I had expected it to be. The world is stunning- Sliding down the Pyramids, Kicking the crap outta War Elephants, The Soundtracks, The Side Quests and The God Slayer Events- all these things made my gameplay lovely as hell. I took my time, I enjoyed the scenic view from every high place, Taking photos and capturing the Scenic beauty of Egypt. It was beautiful. I really love the minor details this game has, like Eye reflections, weapons going down the desert, NPC's daily routine, How the arrows catch fire mid air, The Mirage and Desert Hallucinations, all of them. And yes, you can play with cats I accidentally killed 9 of em around me. I'm sorry! and make Senu do dem rolls mid air.

Senu is more useful than Eagle Vision.
THERE. I SAID IT!

The gameplay isn't that different from the previous installments but the combat style is totally different and Insane. The game's got 4 difficulties to offer i.e. Easy, Normal, Hard and Nightmare. The first three difficulties are okay-ish but the Nightmare mode is where the sh*t gets real.
In Nightmare mode, You can have your a** handed to you by some foot soldier if you're just fooling around and not paying any attention.
There's the Enemies scale level for hardcore players.
And of course, you don't have to hold "E" to loot anymore, silly! There's a skill available in the game for auto loot after you kill the enemy.

The game was a little bit buggy before they released the patch. It still is though, at least for me. The AI is a bit retarded. Dead body or an injured NPC climbs back to the top after you throw them in the Nile, what the heck? Also, The game will use 100% of all your CPUs cores. It will feed on them. "Why?", you ask? Double DRM layer, bro!

To be honest, after completing the main story line, I wasn't satisfied with the ending. I mean I expected more but oh well, you can't have everything in this world now, can you? "The Ezio's family" soundtrack at the end tho, gave me goosebumps.

Overall, the game is f***ing amazing and has it's pros and cons. To me, this is one of the best open world games released in 2017 and I highly recommend buying this game as Ubisoft did one heck of a great job resurrecting the series after a few failures *cough* Unity *cough*.

This game is beautiful to look at, the story is interesting and I am greatly enjoying the over all experience. I would like to see them optimise the game more because I don't understand why I have other games that easily look this good but those games aren't so resource hungry. I am lucky tho as I have a pc thats on the higher end with the fastest gtx 1080 on the market and a core i7-7700k processor, 16gb 3200mhz ram and the game is installed on my toshiba ssd. I am connected to a dell 27" 1440p 144hz monitor and running the game at ultra high preset I average 70+ to 90fps and in busy towns it normally runs in the 60 fps range with occasional dips into the 50fps range and sometimes low 70 fps in town. I am NOT running any OC on my components and after a 5hr straight game play on ORIGINS my gpu and cpu never got over 60C. My cpu is cooled by a corsair H90, and my gpu has triple 100mm fans. I do run an agressive fan curve!

A story about vengeance with beautiful visuals and a huge map though some region are empty because there are some desert areas. The game's RPG elements are fun but can be a little too easy sometimes. A must-have game for new experiences in Assassin's Creed Series.

We are Medjay No More.... We are ASSASSINS!!
Assassin's Creed Origins decided to take the AC Series to some height in the hopes of rebuilding the charisma of the franchise and fortunately, it took the series to an height you'd ever expect to see it scale after we saw what happened to AC Unity and maybe Syndicate too in a way. AC Origins has brought out the best you could ever get from AC. From the classic horses to the ship battles, we are taken to ancient EGYPT and with all the elements that the devs have decided to put in, I can say everything has worked out pretty cool and indeed, AC Origins has emerged as one of the Best of the series after the Ezio Trilogy.
The Game is pretty well optimized and there are no gliches or bugs of any kind as per my knowledge and experience.. The game never ceases to amaze us with its features and given that the enemies are less forgiving, it means they ARE FREAKING STRONG! The game mainly emphasizes on the player taking up the side quests before attempting the main story in order to level up, gain new abilities and weapons of all sorts before facing the main baddies. But, the side quests don't, in any way, make the gameplay cringe-worthy, all seem connected in some way or the other and all are quite unique. Story is amazing! Avoiding spoilers here, so do check out the game.

Vittoria Agili Assassini!!

I'm loving this game so far... Graphics and gameplay are awesome... Good story... Optimization could be better but it's already better than most of ac games... Overall I'll give 9.5/10... So far it's my second favourite ac game after ac black flag...

I honestly haven't enjoyed an AC for years but this one has me back on board.
The setting is large whilst still being interesting, there are plenty of side missions and the weapon selections are better than they have been.

UBisofts decision to take a one year break from the yearly releases of an Assassin's Creed game was a wise decision. The yearly releases were taking a toll on the game making every game seem way too similar and also causing fatique among the fanbase.
Flash forward to 2017 and the release of Assassin's Creed Origins and we see a very different but also very familiar game like its predecessors. Much of the annoying tropes (e.g. infiltrate and eavesdrop or follow a suspect etc) of the game have been removed and new gameplay mechanics have been introduced. But even with these changes it hasn't altered or changed the very distinct 'flavor' of the Assassin's Creed world.

The game is now a huge open world divided up into provinces and you're free to roam anywhere in the world once you finish the initial inroduction of the game. The game for better or worse has become a RPG, introducing experience points and skill points used to access a 'Skill Tree' system to further improve your characters abilities. Hundreds of quests not related to the main story are also a new part of the game helping you to gain experience points but also helping to flesh out ancient Egypt and make it feel more alive.
The fighting system has also been totally overhauled. Gone are the days when you could counter almost every attack and with very little effort instantly kill your opponent. The new fighting system is much more involved making you block or dodge out of the way of your attacker and than counter attack. Although the combat can be more frantic it makes for a heart pumping and rewarding affair.
The beauty of the world is truly something to be seen. This is one of those games you use to show off your new graphics card! The Assassin's Creed series has always been known for the incredible worlds that have been realized and Assassin's Creed Origins has raised that bar. The graphics quality are simply stellar and the level of detail is mind blowing. Especially when many people who play the game may never see half of what is in this world!
The story is done well and the protaganist 'Bayek' is a likable and believable person in the world. Dealing with a personal tragedy only to unearth an incredible conspiracy.,
Assassin's Creed Origins is not only the tellings of the beginnings of the Assassin's Order but also serves as a solid foundation for future games.

Assassin's Creed Origins is an excellent adventure located in ancient Egypt, with a rich background story, characters and greater diversity than any game from the series.

+ Egypt is a beautifully realized setting, showing off distinct cultures and activity
+ Incredible visuals and fidelity that possess great detail
+ Engaging story and lead character keeps things interesting
+ Plenty of noteworthy and memorable side-events and missions

ESSENTIAL 10/10

Assassin’s Creed Origins is an amazing game with beautiful graphics, great new combat system, giant open world with so many activities, looting/upgrading/different weapon types, and so much more that it really differs from so many other AC games. Origins is a huge step above Syndicate and delivers a massive world with many side-quests and lootable items and really relies on the player to take advantage of the area around them and adapt to it. The story is alright and the graphics are absolutely great in some many ways!

+More of an open world game with so much to do compared to a huge empty world of citizens and little activities like the other games
+Lots of quests that aren’t that similar
+Ranking system/Skill trees
+Different weapon types for different play styles
+Different types of loots with different debuffs, with different levels
+Ability to upgrade specific pieces of equipment (health, melee damage, etc.)
+Beautiful game overall, many locations are absolutely breathtaking
+Photo mode
+New combat system that is really fun and suits the current time period
+Hud is really good looking
+Tombs
+Bayek can seamlessly climb on almost any surface even when it looks impossible to climb, making it less annoying to have to run around an entire building just to find the one way up
+A hopeful better start to the present timeline
+Somewhat “hunting” aspect
+Re-added underwater exploration and naval warfare
+Lots of attention to detail
+Chariot racing
+Gladiator fighting
+Lots of Greek & Roman culture throughout the game
+Several high level/tough enemies that add a great challenge throughout the map
+Desert hallucinations
+Able to fight the Gods
+Steam achievements!
+Nice ode to Final Fantasy
+Animus Control Panel is actually really cool
+The Virtual Musuem Tour is so good and is worth the try it is very interesting!

-Several hidden button short-cuts to change looks/abilties that are never mentioned
-If you finish Diocoles misson before ending the main story everytime you boot up the game again Bayek will say "I wonder how Diocoles is doing?"
-Uplay
-Uplay notifications are annoying
-Microstranstations
-Quite the performance issues
-You can burn the ♥♥♥♥ out of/execute allies and they just walk it off
-Hitbox issues with several enemies
-Felt that the Ancient Civilization tombs just had really cryptic and odd meaning behind them and wish they were in the story more
-Overall tombs weren’t that entertaining, would have wish they could of have made them like an hour long exploration that would be amazing the entire time
-Wish there were less side quests popping up near the end of the game
-Certain allies will lie on the ground for awhile and won’t get up for minutes regarding to quests
-The chain attack move set is awk when you throw an instant kill weapon at an enemy yet majority of the time it hits their shield yet it kills them... what.
-Constant reminders to fight the Gods is annyoing
-Felt that the option to lower the sound isn't really an option so the game is always loud

Origins is a much better game than Syndicate with a beautiful and vibrant, living open world game. The story is as what you would expect from an Assassin’s Creed but isn’t overall that bad. There’s ton of side-quests and activities to due as well as a new leveling system and tons of different equipment to use. However there is a lot about this game that could have been slightly tweaked or altered to make better but overall the game is amazing and I think Ubisoft should take time to create more of their games like this instead of pooping one out every year. Quality of quantity.

TLDR: I recommend the game, if you enjoyed Black Flag you'll like this one

This is my first review, so please bear with me.

I've played Assassin's Creed 3, 4 and Unity all on PC. I loved Black Flag (4) but Unity made me lose faith in the franchise, however this installment drew me back in. I’ve also played Far Cry 4.

I haven't even finished a sixth of the game yet and I’ve already sunk 10 hours in and look forward to each time I go to play.

I feel that the development team taking a year off did them very well. Origins feels like a mixture of Far Cry + Assassin’s Creed. It feels like an RPG, I constantly want to kill animals to get their skins and ambush soldiers for their goods to upgrade my gear. It is a grind but it is quite fun and drawing. There is a form of microtransactions in here, it’s not as nearly as bad as Unity was but if you look through the store you can get some great gear for Helix credits, however you can still play and have large amounts of fun with just the vanilla game. The store is quite good and grasped me quickly.

I do have one grip with the game, when you clear military camps or locations and complete the location (killing the general/commanders and looting it) I feel the zone should become neutral and no longer be controlled by the enemy but that’s the thought process Far Cry has installed in me.
Regardless of that the game is fantastic and looking at the upcoming DLC I’m very excited.
So far I’ve encountered no bugs and no crashing. I do get some FPS dips and stuttering but I’m running every option maxed out @ 1440p (I have my PC Specs listed on my Steam Profile) and I get a constant 60 FPS I can’t really complain.

I do have a Logitech G933 wireless surround sound headset and I’ve read with some players having sound issues with Logitech headsets but I’ve haven’t encountered a single one, prior to playing the game I did make sure my Logitech Gaming Software and headset firmware were both up to date.

Overall I highly recommend the game 👍, I bought the gold edition. If you’re looking to save money I’m sure the U-Play only edition will go sale more often and most likely sooner than the Steam version but if you get the U-Play edition, there isn’t the trading card drops or Steam Achievements.

when i defeated Anubis i did not get the scroll can u please fix it and also this game is amazing except the glitch

Also there is an outrage about hekix coins? whats do i think about it, i dont mind it does not really limit you from playing the game or the mission and for those that say they can buy furs and bronze etc, does it affect your gameplay? Its not like there is multiplayer or anything.

Assassin's Creed: Origins is a beautiful example of Ubisoft's best game mechanics combined with an amazing environment (visually and immersively) and a great story structure that is immersive and engaging, but doesn't railroad players and allows for exploration of the amazingly detailed world.

To put play time in context, it took me about 2 hours to 100% the first area. This review will be just after those first two hours.


I completely recommend this game. Those that buy it should be aware that i believe it is a big change from the last assassins creed i played, which was Black Flag i think. I am still very much enjoying this game, and have had only small technical problems which may or may not be my fault maybe? After alt tabbing the sound started having little bits of feedback and echoing, after this i stopped playing tonight hopefully ill remember to say whether it was still there after reopening the game. Edit; Cannot figure out whats causing the feedback it only happens in this game sadly. makes me not want to play

For all the people who are worried about the complaints that the game is way too heavy on peoples systems ill add my experience.

Im Currently running:
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700K CPU
Geforce Gtx 1070
16 gb ddr5
Boot Drive ssd
Game is saved to a 7200rpm hdd

With this game, discord, uplay, steam, norton, and about 10 tabs of google crome open after two hours of continuous gameplay i was sitting at 60% average cpu usage. My GPU was sitting at about 15 % or so and at ~55 degrees Celcius. Quality was set to High as that was the default setting ( i was too lazy to update my video drivers so maybe thats why?). My frames were smooth at over 300 in the begining but after about 10 minutes i did cap it to 144. Edit; Updated video drivers made it better.

Played some more of this on the weekend. It is a magnificent game. Combat is fun, music is excellent, and graphics are beautiful with amazing atmospheric effects. Lot's of very interesting places and caves to explore. I am enjoying the storylines and side quests.

I've encountered three bugs so far:
- Had to unplug my Thrustmaster HOTAS to be able to use the mouse in the game. It sticks in the centre of the screen if I have them plugged in.
- Had a buzzing sound with framerate freezes and missing speech. Fixed this by disabling all audio playback devices except for my Sound Blaster Z card.
- Sometimes animals glitch and get stuck in rocks and other landscape objects. I've also seen NPC's glitch and get stuck in the geometry.

Later edit:
Almost 70 hours into this game and I am still enjoying every minute of playing it and look forward to loading it up every day. If there was ever any doubt Ubisoft is one of the masters of the open world game then this should be the prime example of open world done right. A stunning achievement.

This game was a lot better than I expected it to be, lots of side quest to do, only down side is that you're forced to do some in the beginning, not everyone will like that, but I don't mind.

If you do a lot of side quests throughout the game, by the end of the game you'll be too high of a level, so everything is kind of easier than it has to be.

One thing that gets repetetive is the camps, there are 3 types of camps, level 1, 2 and 3, but whats good here is that they don't look the same, but the concept is the same, loot treasures, kill captain(s) and commander(s).

I remember one thing I hated about Black Flag is that every area felt the same, everything was really green and just felt the same, so this was something I was worried about as it's the same people who made this game. I feel like they nailed it in this game. Each area is differerent, at least I haven't seen areas that remind me of somewhere else in the game. Only thing is a few houses in a city which might have the same interior designs, but that's nothing really.

Not sure if I missed anything, to sum it up, one of the best Assassin's Creed games I've played in a long time. If you're an Assassin's Creed fan and have been dissapointed these last few years, then you wont be by this game.

Its pretty amazing so far!

It has a huge open world to explore with plenty to do and its defenitely a fresh take on the AC series.

Just a few things that I like are the ability to us 1h,2h, dual blades,bows,xbows, and other weapons. The combat
is no longer just spam parry and counter, you actually have to multi task and fight with some thought.

The world is very detailed and beautiful, it runs 40-60fps on my GTX 970. I would also recommend using a
controller as there are alot of buttons.

In short, I was hopeing it wasnt just another AC. It turned out to be, IMO a completly new experience and would reccomend it.

Could the legends be true about the double-DRM?

Enjoying it so far, but the random frame-drops are extremely offputting. This could easily be my favorite asscreed game if they are able to fix the DRM. It runs fine on my desktop, but my laptop's i7 processor just craps itself, regardless of which settings I have the graphical options on.

If your processor is made out of the melted flesh of Godzilla, then I'd say give this game a go, it's pretty gewd.

This game is incredibly impressive. Just to start off by the fact that I have been blown away from just a mere 2 hours gameplay. This is most possibly the best Assassin's Creed game to date. If by chance you're on the fence of deciding whether to buy it, definitely give it a go !

Thıs game ıs a great example of how a game should progress durıng a long series. Action, Adventure, Scenery, Story, it's fantastic.

As I'm now completed the main story, uncovered the map and towards finishing side missions, there is much to be had, the scenery is gorgeous and there's always action. The story has a twist at the end, and as one to love the Romans, it was nice to see Julius Caesar and Cleopatra in the game. Thanks Ubisoft for one of the best AC's yet! I even felt shivers as I rode a camel in the Desheret Desert with the beautiful view and loneliness feeling.

Set in 49BCE, Julius Ceaser is coming to power and Jesus is 40 some odd years away from being born. The start of the Assassin Brotherhood starts here. Using a 980mGTX/4GB,32 GB of RAM, i7-4600k settings are all on Very High to High. 45-55fps stable.

Game looks beautiful, i adore the RPG elements in the game. As if I don't always feel like I'm playing a traditional A.C game. That's a good thing. Lead character is a bad a s s , and I can't speak much of the flow of the story so far being only 2 hours in, I'm pretty happy with the theme of the game and the time period.

Some minor audio issues, aside, I think it's optimized "ok", but could be better. If you are a fan of the series, I would most certainly pick it up.

Love the Egypt setting. This game is more RPG than the previous Assassin's Creed games.

CPU usage is high on my old processor but the game is playable. During gameplay, I don't notice any slow down or low frame rate.

Terribly "optimized". Ubish*t seems to have put VMProtect to protect Denuvo, and hogged a ton of CPU usage thanks to that. I have a i7-7700k OC'd at 4.8GHz (stable) and a GTX 1080 OC'd to 2100MHz but still can't maintain a stable 1080p60fps. Don't buy it, wait till they patch it.

Edit January 2018:
It's a decent game. Still laggy af but the beauty of the game kinda makes it worth the purchase on sale.

Gameplay: So-so, a step up from previous AC's lackluster combat and weapon system. Stealth option are much more viable and enjoyable overall. Didn't do much swordplay aside from forced combats so won't comment much on that. Though there's too much grinding, but can be skipped with trainers optionally.

Story: Not the best out of AC-verse, but it's alright. Interesting and cheesy enough to make it worth while.

The world is expansive, beautiful, well-crafted. (Almost) Every frame is a picture. Just that there's way too much clutters on UI, but if you turn off UI completely then it lacks specific features needed: For example, there's always a giant "Press () to call Senu" when objective is nearby. It's completely unnecessary and should be optional, considering how quest log gave actual hint on how to find target. Yes, you can turn call senu off by turning hud to minimal, but then the quest log hint will also be gone.

Ubisoft please make UI customizable.

tldr:
6/10 for gameplay+story as is.
8/10 if you want to enjoy the story and the beautifully-crafted world and willing to compromise to use trainers to soften the grind (or skip it completely).

Amazing game, would reccommend getting even at the high 60 dollar price for new games. The graphics look amazing even at low settings, the combat experience is great, its balanced it doesn't feel like you are way stronger than the enimies, or way weaker. ALSO THE STORY LINE IS AMAZING, BEST ASSASSINS CREED EVER

First of all want to say thanks for my good friend who gifted me this game, love ya! :)

Finished this game completely and base game was good but not best.

Main story from base game was interesting but not the best compared to earlier games from series.
Some new interesting game mechanincs but not to much changes which is ok for me as a fan of series ;)
Owerall base game is ok but not the best from series.

About dlc's:

The Hidden Ones - kinda boring story except basicly like 2 missions from it.
The Curse Of The Pharaohs - this is a proper dlc i must say, story was really great, you meet famous Pharaons which is really fun :) Area of it is much bigger than The Hidden Ones which is great.

As a fan of series who played all AC games i can totaly recomend it to everyone :)

We wuz kangz!

If you like Assassin's Creed, this game is great. (Although it took me a couple hours to adapt to the changes, especially in the changes in combat).

If you value video games based on dollars per hour, I doubt you will find a better value in a single player, offline experience. It reminds me of the pastrami sandwich at the Carnegie Deli in New York, that uses so much meat, it is hardly recocnizable as a sandwich anymore. Their goal is to make the sandwich so big, it can't be eaten. If you eat the whole thing, the chefs feel like they failed. That is AC Origins.... even without DLC, without digital deluxe nonsense, without the loot crates, there are hundreds of hours of quality game here.

The story is great, the environment is amazing.... But do not try to 100% this, there is too much content, you will make yourself sick.

EDIT: DO NOT BUY AS OF RIGHT NOW. GAME CRASHING CONSTANTLY FOR SEVERAL PEOPLE. WAIT UNTIL GAME IS FIXED.

ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW (THUMBS UP):

Great game. Still haven't finished it yet.

That being said, take its historical accuracy with a grain of salt. My only problem is the "historical" marketing pitch.

As in other AC games, there are obviously artistic liberties and fictions to make the story work. Specifically, there are elements of fantasy in the characters, weapons, magic, etc. as in other AC games. And, as in other AC games, many of the historical settings have elements of fantasy/fiction to make the story work.

If someone told you to get this game for your kid or something to learn history, don't. If someone told you you could learn a lot about ancient egypt, wrong. The game is obviously trying to push a present-day political message, and prioritizes this over portraying a more historically accurate egyptian cultural setting. Most notably, the game attempts to make many of the problems about modern notions of race in the following ways:
1) The game portrays pretty much all the Ptolemic Greeks as pasty, pasty white. They sort of white-washed it for lack of a better term. In reality, only Northern Greeks were thought to have light skin. Greeks that would have been living in Egypt at the time would have had a much darker complexion.
2) The first point normally wouldn't have been noticable. But, the game portrays the primary issues as being ones of skin color, where the Greek regime attempts to segregate and oppress the black egyptians (at one point a priest tells you that all the problems are racial, and tells you to "just look at your skin, Siwan"). In reality, historical evidence indicates the ancient Greeks/Romans did not use skin color as a justification for slavery. Additionally, evidence inidicates that Greek/Roman society was not segregated, ever, by skin color. In fact, parts of the empire that were in modern Africa were considered 100% Greek, and black citizens were considered completely Greek, while Northern Gauls from Germany/Russia and Nordic peoples were considered barbarians. The aryan barbarians were likely the largest slave pool for the Ancient Greeks.
3) The game, as stated above, attempts to make skin color an issue when it was not at the time. The term "Ethiopia" roughly translates to sun-burnt. The textual evidence we have indicates that this was not an insult. Thus, "Ethiopians" are thought to have been regarded simply as permanently sun-burnt Greeks.
4) The game has Greeks calling Egyptians "barbarians." The overwhelming majority of Greek textual references to the word "barbarian" were in the context of Eastern Slavs and Norther Gauls, not Egyptians. In fact, Egyptians at the time were regarded as Greek citizens in many parts of Egypt.
5) The game portrays Greece as imposing its culture on Egypt in an attempt to erase Egyptian culture. While the Greeks/Macedonians did conquer Egypt, historians to this day tend to agree that Greek culture was heavily influenced by Egyptian culture. Greek leadership embraced Egyptian culture, many even electing to be mummified, and some worshipping Egyptian gods.
6) Cleopatra is all jacked up.
7) The game appropriated subsaharan African culture and inserted to Egyptian culture. Bayek's Siwan gladiator friend obviously was meant to portray subsaharan African people, as there is little to no evidence indicating that any Egyptians dressed, pierced, or scarred their body like that.
8) Many of these issues are also present in the "museum" mode that was meant as a learning tool. In fact, Ubisoft even disclosed publicly that they changed some things in the learning mode to be more inclusive/politically correct at the expense of history.
As far as the monuments, map, cities, atmosphere, they did a great job. The skin color of the Egyptians was fine in my opinion, as no historian really knows from text what Egyptians looked like skin-wise. All that is largely agreed upon is that they were at least as dark as, and probably much darker than Souther Greeks. Anyway, the Egyptians seem to have a more diverse range of skin tones in the game. Thus, anyone complaining the Egyptians in the game are "too black" should probably do some more research.

I don't care about politics, and the message the game pushes (e.g. white people oppressing black people in the modern sense and it needs to be fought against; The protagonist should always fight to live in harmony and peace) isn't a bad one in my opinion. But, do note that the game sacrifices A LOT of history to push this message. As an Egypt-lover, this was somewhat off putting.

Summary:

Pros:
Awesome game.
Buy it if you love RPG's, Witcher 3, AC, open world games.
It's worth the price for once Ubisoft.
Cons:
Dishonest marketing as a "historical" game when the devs have openly come out about sacrificing historical accuracy for inclusivity.
Don't buy for any historical value.

Amazing graphics, 'nice' storyline (you can be halted until you level up, unless you pay for "timesaver" ((not microtransactions :p)) or do sidequests until you can go back and pick the storyline which may get you confuzed since there are so many), there is this awesome feature in which you can 'hack' the anumus and play a cheat-enable version disabling achievements but you play however you want!!.... except the newly force-merged ubisoft connect disabled it and no longer works.. then there is ubisoft connect which .. well not that great, you have to play offline mode if you don't want to be spoiled by players taking pics of secret places or getting constant "avenge" quests from other players ((this game has a GOOD system unlike valhalla in which you can't evade the quest, this version you have to interact with a corpse which does not trigger endlessly warnings about it))
combat... is.. meh... along with movement.. it's just.. another AC game.. move along... the parkour hasn't been upgraded nor updated since day 1.. the same way you got stuck trying to climb THAT door frame in AC1, AC2, AC... AC-valhalla is here, combat is... better... ish.... each version of AC has it's own pros and cons. enemies can stun you easy and depend on their level, type and attack they may stagger or just ignore all and just hit you or 1shot you through your attacks
stealth.. is buggy as hell, sometimes they can't see if standing in a tiny leaf with 9999 corpses piled on it, others.. they just ignore everything and even when they don't know where the corpses are or even that they died.. they just walk to the corpse and pick them to carry away... (???? don't ask, they just do it for me, if i'm hidding near the corpses they will spot me regardless my cover) others their pathfinding goes DEEEERP!! DEEERP!!! and they decide to take a 10 mile route around the map just to turn left or right.. others they will just walk straight into your hidding spot away from everything cause.. why not?..
exploration.. i LOVE it, wandering for hours in an endless desert, tundra, sea, forest... just.. breathtaking ... until bandits pop and force combat or any wild life decides to have me for snack
music, it's great
ambient sound... it's.. erm.. half good.. half i wish i could rip my ears off... walking in the night can make an WEIRD sound be heard from the lower front of your headset which can be a bit nerve breaking since there is nothing that could be making it, sadly, as all games, no option to customize sounds at all, so if you are ok with sounds of metal crashing constantly in fights, yells, sounds of spiders, bats, etc well you won't have issues.. i don't either.. except the weird sound i mentioned which made me evade aqueducts in the night

recommend it.. but... get it on a sale or for wait for a "free weekend" to see if you can run it without issues

Superb graphics, nice design, lot of action. Can be boring after a while as the there are repetitive actions, but I put it aside for few months and now is again exciting. Story not as good as some other AC games, but isn't so bad too. Overall I recommend it especially if it's on sales! Gl hf!

Assassin's Creed Origins is an open world RPG set in ancient Egypt. Like nearly every AAA game, Origins is being sold for 60 euros, but is it worth it? Let's find out.

The good, the bad, and the mixed

THE GOOD

-Egypt is an interesting setting for an open world game.

-There's lots of stuff to do. Every area has a bunch of side quests, animals to hunt, loot to find, etc. And of course there's the main quest.

-The story is somewhat interesting.

-Gear and abilities work well.

-Mounts are OP. Need to kill a pharaoh? Just run over him with a horse. Who needs assassins?

THE BAD

-The game sometimes crashes for no reason or gets stuck in loading screens. CPU usage is also off the charts. This is what happens when you pile DRM on top of DRM.

-Microtransactions in a 60 € singleplayer game. Well, at least the game's true ending isn't locked behind a paywall. (I'm looking at you, Warner Brothers)

THE MIXED

-The combat is a bit messy but not too annoying.

Conclusion

It's best to buy it during a sale. I myself paid the full price of 60€ for the non-DLC edition and I think it's a bit too high due to the DRM mess and such. This is my first Assassin's Creed though so I don't know how good it is when compared to the earlier titles.

Final score: C for Crocodiles can sink ships

If you like trailing missions play this game
If you like a predictable story play this game
If you want boring combat and murdering in a game about ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ assassination play this game
If a feather is your weapon of choice play this game
If you want to have an experience that is just like dragging your balls on a running motercycle wheel on fire in hell then play this game

don't waste your time and money. microtransactions in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ single player game. you'll find yourself under-leveled and unable to progress, so you either play the soul crushing minuscule xp side quests to level up, or pay over the asking price for "xp boosters". this is a horrible game

Is actually a good Assassins Creed game, the new rpg style isn’t stale at this point, but i’m unable to play the game due to uplay link, i got signed out of my uplay account and into another, unable to find the old account so i literally can’t play the game. Sorry Ubi cause for once you did good, STOP FORCING US TO LINK GAMES TO UPLAY ACCOUNTS UPLAY IS ♥♥♥♥

Game looks absolutely amazing, but this game isn't a slouch. If you aren't running a complete potato computer you easily be able to hit a solid 60 fps plus. I am getting a solid 60 fps with max settings on a 1440p monitor with my GTX 1070, a 970 just isn't going to cut it anymore these days. If you actually have a computer that can play newer games from the past two years, the game should run fine for you. Also don't forget to download your latest gpu drivers!!! Theres plenty of new features and the gameplay does feel like its completely changed compared to the other AC games which is cool because it feels new and fresh. It still does have certain elements that have the AC feel, but it almost feels like a completely new IP. Like I said earlier the graphics are amazing, the attention to detail and draw distances on such a large map are absolutely amazing in this game. Really love all of the different loot and weapons and such you can get and the expanded skill tree in this game is really cool, def makes the game feel a lot more RPG than just an action game. Overall really enjoyable so far!

I hate this game for wasting my time
70% of the game so far (20+ h) has been me getting from A to B.
side quests so disconnected from EVERYTHING and are only there to grind. Everything feels repetitive... and according to video game press this game is "the first AC game that ISN'T repetitive"
HAVE THEY EVEN SEEN BLACK FLAG YET?

I know the press LOVES to compare this game to the Witcher 3 (a game that does NOT waste your time)

so let's see...

Witcher3:
Literally every character you interact with is unique, I care about literally every one of them. even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ merchants have personalities, the map is not unnecessarily big, every area feels different. every quest ties into some form of side plot in some way...

AC Origins:
Graphics are great. Senu (the bird) is kind of a cool concept. less bugs than in The Witcher 3... oh and the main characters are brown people and we love to see it.

and that's it. that's literally everything positive I could come up with. I don't care about any of the characters, not even his generic sun and wife. They all look act and feel the same.

also... ♥♥♥♥ Ubisoft for having the audacity put micro-transactions in there...
yes you can ignore it completely... I don't give a ♥♥♥♥.

Best open world game set in Ancient Egypt that i have ever played. Absolutely stunning re-creation of ancient Egypt. Gameplay is fun and the story is great. This game is definitely a must play and a positive move in the right direction for the assassins creed franchise which was becoming so boring. It also runs much better now than it did on release so you should definitely play this one.

This is by far my favorite game of all time. I've played through the story three times and have 100% completed the base game, DLCs, and tour mode. I love it -- it is an unforgettable adventure and speaks to my soul in so many ways. As someone who's working their way towards becoming an Egyptologist, I very much approve of this game.

Hello,

My name is Alberto Martins, and I am that kind of gamer that loves something about the games more then actually the game. In my case, it is maps. I'm a map collector, and I've been looking online for people that sales the physical edition of maps, even digital versions. Recently, I've been looking for the Assassin's Creed Origins map, and because I'm from Brazil, sometimes it's not easy to find a physical version. I know that others games have the map content on Steam, like The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt. So, I'm writting these words to ask you guys to provide me a version, digital version in PDF, so I cant add in my collection, and even to print, to frame and put together in my wall, with the other ones that I have.

I really appreciate,

Alberto Martins de Lima Junior.




Olá,

Meu nome é Alberto Martins, e eu sou daquele tipo de jogador que muitas vezes gosta de algumas coisas sobre games mais do que o próprio jogo. No meu caso, são mapas. Eu sou um colecionador de mapas, e eu estive procurando online por pessoas que vendam versões físicas desses mapas, e também procuro por versões digitais. Recentemente, estive procurando pelo mapa de Assassin's Creed Origins, e por eu ser do Brasil, as vezes não é tão fácil encontrar a versão física. Eu sei que outros jogos têm o conteúdo do mapa na própria Steam, como é o caso do The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt. Então eu estou escrevendo esse texto para pedir para vocês disponibilizarem a versão do mapa do Assassin's Creed Origins para que eu possa adicionar à minha coleção, e até mesmo imprimir, emoldurar e colocar junto aos outros que eu tenho na minha parede.

Agradeço antecipadamente.

Att,

Alberto Martins de Lima Junior

After 4 hours I found a beach in north-eastern Alexandria with naked ladies. They seem to like my hawk-mask.

Update:
Day 6. Still at the beach. My falcon is getting bored and starts attacking random topless ladies. Think I have to get rid of him.

Beautiful, playable and immersive AC game.

The antic Egypt is captured perfectly it feels exactly as you are there, at least as we perceive it.

Story is ok and main character is excellent on his road to vengeance.

Locations, deserts, tombs, Nile, pyramids and cities are really beautiful.

This is a great game for everyone, especially AC fans.

Pros

New Combat is rewarding and challenging.
Beautiful graphics, the landscape leave you in awe, building or environment textures are superb.
Main and even repetitive side quests feel rewarding.
Stealth is fantastic
Loads of gear

Cons

Crashes often, mostly on start up or loading screen. It once crashed 5 times in 3 minutes for me.
NPC models look outdated.
Unoptimised for PC, you really need a current day(2021) beefy machine to run this game on ultra and get 90 FPS+ in 1080p which is unacceptable as this game came out in 2017!


It is the biggest overhaul in the series to date in terms of gameplay and it is welcomed. I have found that the past AC games get boring and fast but for some reason 50 hours in, I am completely engrossed.

Buy on sale.

base game is very enjoyable, the hidden ones is also a good time, curse of the pharaohs is the weaker dlc in my opinion but that's only because it is likely you'll be overlevelled by this point in the game but still has a lot of cool moments.

It is such an amazing game, the wonderful graphic, and I really like the level system with the quests. I played many other AC games where the story is a little bit better in my opinion, but I really searched for a game like this one. I love Egypt, the gods, the tradition and everything about it. Also you have soooo many hours in playing this game if u want to complete it 100% and thats great because i want to never end a great game like Assassins Creed Origins. As I said i like the quests log system a lot. I love the fact that you can go to a person who needs your help and you can help this person whenever you want. Also the quests have cut scenes and imagine doing so much work in this game, all over the world are voicelines, so many little details you may have not seen. And if this is not enough, they have a discovery tour beside the story game. I love this game. I definitely recommend it c:

This is where it all begins, The creed born out of the shadows, Assassin's Creed Origins is one of the best games of the entire franchise and comes in line with the Ezio Trilogy in terms of story, The game design, World map/Level Design is amazing and is perhaps the best in the whole series. They managed to get the mystical feeling of Egypt just right. I really loved Bayek as a character, with Abubakar Salim giving tremendous performance. Bayek deserves one more game for sure. Ubi really missed out on this one. Odyssey is absolutely trash in front of Origins, in terms of well, everything.

buy this instead of Odyssey.

The only other Assassins Creed I've enjoyed was Black Flag so take that for what you will, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. After trying to pick up just about every game released between black flag and now, yet never really finding any enjoyment in them I was quite happy. I have spent many, many hours exploring egypt and have never found myself bored playing this game. Often I would tell myself, ok just a bit more after a 10 hour marathon session and still find myself running over to the next camp or trying to grab the next treasure. The side quests are enjoyable and are similar to the Witcher 3 in that they are not repetitive pointless quests. The game is beautiful and truly a sight to behold. I still can't quite believe the sheer scope.

10/10 worth way more than I paid.

This one is probably the best entry in the Assassin's Creed franchise. The new combat system feels good and so does the new RPG-like system. The open world is simply amazing with many secrets to explore. This entry also shows us the beginning of the Creed.

Story and gameplay
You play as Bayek, a medjay from acient egypt. After a secret cult kills your son, you go on a quest to kill every single one of it's members. To do so, you'll travel through Egypt (yes, all of it, the map is that big) and meet some known names such as Cleopatra and Julius Caesar.

This game also marks the first time that heavy RPG-like elements are introduced. Your character (Bayek) as a level that goes up when you gain XP (duh). Main and side quests have a recommend level for you to complete them, you can try and go underlevel but it will be tougher than normal. There are also various types of weapons to buy and discover. From regular swords, to daggers and spears; from a regular hunting bow, to a super fast light bow; each weapon as it's own benefits and drawbacks.

Weapons of the same type vary between them in rarity, from common to legendary. The higher the rarity the better that weapon will be. Epic weapons and above come with special perks that might set your weapon permanently on fire, or might apply poison to your enemies as you hit them.

Finally, you have abilities that you can equip. There are 8 slots, 4 melee abilities and other 4 ranged. You can unlock abilities with ability points that you will gain as you level up, or when you complete secret locations on the map.

Veredict
Assassin's Creed Origins is, in my opinion, the best of the Assassin's Creed so far (even after Odyssey and Valhalla release). The open world feels alive and it's graphically incredible. The RPG-like elements are done well and the game doesn't feel to grindy.
I definitely recommend buying this game whether you are or not a big fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise.

11/10 game, would get one shot by a random snake again.

I picked up this game during the 2018 Winter Sale for like 20 bucks. So far, it seems to be a pretty great experience overall. The story is interesting, the main characters aren't bland, and the side quests and other things happening in the world tie into the main story quite nicely.

As for the gameplay, it's more like The Witcher than it is like Assassin's Creed. Classic stealth is still an option of course, but combat is more varied and dynamic than ever which I think is a good thing for this series and was a breath of fresh air after 10 previous games struggling to have engrossing combat. The game is a bit grindy as other people have said, and you pretty much have no choice but to do side quests and some of the busywork that Ubisoft is famous for to progress through the main story. Which isn't a terrible thing I suppose as the gameplay, while repetitive, is fun in and of itself.

Graphics are beautiful, especially when the settings are maxed out in 4K HDR, although most people will struggle to maintain a playable framerate under those circumstances. You can really tell the developers had a good time making this world and the extra year of polish really shows. It runs pretty well for me; it doesn't scream of terrible optimization although it could be better. If you have a low end PC you will struggle though as this game is very CPU intensive so keep that in mind.

Overall 8/10
+Good Story and Character Development
+Beautiful visuals
+Immersive world and soundtrack
+Fun combat and RPG mechanics

-Somewhat poor optimization (although I am not affected much by it)
-Repetitive and grindy at times
-Uplay is a requirement

Just a a massive fresh take on the franchise, in one of the best, well done settings yet. As a continuation in the ASC collection, or a standalone, this game is fantastic and considering its price during any of the quarterly steam sales, an easy recomendation and a great addition to anyones collection.

ahh, easily the best assassin's creed game, completely revamped. even the newcomers will love it. the story is mysterious and engaging, kept me hooked to my seat. combat is challenging now compared to previous games, but it is fun, i can keep on going to the arena for fights and only fights. looks beautiful and runs good. i wont rate it because this game needs no ratings, it is absolutely flawless. would recommend it to all the citizens of the earth, and if animals could play i'd recommend this game to them too. have fun

8/10

Pros:
- Great Visuals
- Well Composed Music
- Diverse Environment
- Plenty of stuff to do
- Revisiting old historic locations
- Good storyline (only for those who have played the series)
- Excellent Combat controls & a good variety of Combat Actions
- Predator Bows are very fun to use
- Ability to scan locations with an eagle
- Runs very smoothly, No Bugs!

Cons:
- Boring Characters
- Storyline too driven by vengeance and unrelated to the overall AC story (except at the very end)
- You will never get to obtain some of the best Armor & Weapons in the game unless you pay for them
- You will be stuck with terrible weapons & outfits for the first half of the game
- Not enough in-game money available to buy Rare Loot, and not enough XP to max out the Abilities Tree.. I have finished the game 100% and there are abilities I wasn't able to obtain..
- Very low number of arrows given even if you fully upgrade pouch
- You don't get rewarded for Completing Side Quests and Collectibles.. you only do it for the "Old Habits" achievement.
- So few costumes available.. Good costumes can only be bought online..
- Too much open space.. Plus, most of the map is mountains and villages..
- You won't feel like you're playing Assassin's Creed .. it feels like a totally different RPG game
- No Rooftop Jumping, most buildings are separated
- No Multiplayer or Co-Op..
- Aya (main character's wife) is probably the least interesting character to have ever been introduced to the series


** If the next AC will feature Aya then I predict it will be an utter disaster, they tried hard to give her a good introduction, but sadly she is just too boring to withstand..

Following the decline of the Assassin's Creed franchise, I'm glad Ubisoft made the decision to build this game from scratch. The overall gameplay feels fresh yet retains the essence of an Assassin's creed game.

STORY: Storywise, I have no complaints, I won't say it is better than some of the other successful AC titles, but it is good nonetheless.

COMBAT: The combat here is my favourite part of the game so far. Gone are the days of just an attack/parry button, the new combat controls make fights more challenging, yet satisfying.

GAMEPLAY: This game takes on the more RPG, open world game approach, with countless side quest and places to explore. Although the sidequest may be a little tedious to complete sometimes, every one of them is different and unique. There is plenty to do around the map of Egypt, from exploring tombs to hunting animals, to saving villagers from bandits. The developers really added lots of detail to make Egypt lively and immersive. Another thing to add is that events and community challenges such as the Trial of the Gods, offers more content to players who have already completed the main storyline.

GRAPHICS Nothing much to say here, the graphics is amazing. Egypt is vibrant and beautiful.

PERFORMANCE On my setup with a gtx1060 and a 4th Generation i5 cpu, the game runs smooth, averaging at around 60fps. In towns, it drops to around 40fps, which is still playable. However, if you CPU isnt powerful enough, you may encounter an issue where NPCs take awhile to render. Resulting in faceless mannequins, or clay model looking figures in place of the NPCs. There is a picture in this thread [forums.ubi.com] otherwise, there should not be any issue that might make this game unplayable.

Overall, this is a great game, and i would definately recommend it.

Origins was an okay game that had the potential to be a good, even great game. While the game is beautiful, this aspect is, unfortunately, it's best quality. The dialogue is redundant and there is very little character depth. The quests all seem to follow the same general pattern; infiltrate a barracks or outpost and assasinate the commanders, rescue some NPCs and loot some treasure. While this is fun for awhile, the developers could have made more effort to increase variety. Overall, Origins is a B- game that had a lot of potential to have a better narrative and deeper character depth.

A very good step up from the older games of assassins creed
This might very well be the best game in the series.
Pros+
+colours are vibrant
+Very good graphics
+pretty good optimization
+big map
+some online activities, not like unity's though
+Great story
+great combat, more difficulty
+more responsive
+movements are more realistic, feels less like a scripted thing (e.g you can actually perform leaps of faith wrongly now)
+exhilerating boss battles
+The Hud has been minimised for immersion
+The first truly RPG open world assassins creed, with findable swords, hunting, crafting, and many hidden dungeons

Cons? Not many
-Needs at least a high end graphics card to play at somewhat decent graphics
-High pricepoint as of now
-Needs a good cpu as well
-Not very linear, may be a con for some

Overall, a solid experience. This is my new favourite game as it beat ac 4. Made by the same team,no less, I feel like Im playing an entirely new series compared to the others. Combat has been improved to a more dark souls-witcher 3 kind of combat, now requiring actual skill to play. No longer can you just 1v the entire guard population. One thing that Im not very happy about is the fact that armour is not customizable, unlike the witcher 3. This game truly brings back the AC franchise after a horrible Unity and a mediocre-decent ac syndicate

this game is very good overall. it's a beautiful game that grabs your attention the minute the story starts.

pros:
-voice acting
-beautiful graphics with a nice open-world of ancient egypt
-fun quests with plenty of side-quests and other things to do
-photo mode is great and fun to look at photos that other players have taken. you can get very creative with them.
-gathering resources
-the music is good and immersive
-senu is great. you can locate objects, treasure, enemies, and resources with him

cons:
-combat can be clumsy
-bayek's story is REALLY short and kind of basic. it draws you in but it wasn't a creative enough story to stretch out very far. for me, the final main quest was finish unexpectedly and i was a little salty about it
-ship combat is slow and annoying
-the leveling system gets kind of slow, espeically when you're trying to grind XP after finishing all main quests.

It feels like they realized their own mistakes with the latest games before Origins. The itemhunt/collection is severely tuned down and they seem to have put thought behind each collection and area. The fact the game after all these hours reminds me of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Witcher says a lot about how they taken influences from other games and tried to revamp Assassins Creed a little bit.

The combat is completely different from previous games and it is much better, it's fun and requires more active participation than previous games, less button spamming and more planned attacks. Sometimes a little too easy and sometimes unforgiving. For those looking for a challenge, do play on hard difficulty.

It's a fresh new start to the series and I hope they can continue with future AC games in the Style of Origins, rather than going back to Unity, Liberation or Black Flag games. AC: Origins was a blast to play from first minute to the last achievement and that is coming from someone that isn't a diehard fan of the AC games lately, I did not 100% Unity cause the collection and gameplay simply wasn't that fun. I never fancied Black Flag that much, but I loved liberation.

If you enjoy games like BOTW and Witcher, AC: Origins is right down your ally. There has been claims of poor performance, stuttering and high CPU usage. I cannot comment on that since it ran fine for me from start to finish on a 970 GTX.

This is BOTW with fancier graphics and a more signficiant story. Speaking of the Story it makes sense, it engages and holds quite a few surprises, but it never breaks away from AC logic and honestly it was a great Origin-story. The "Secret of the first pyramid" DLC was however a let down and completed in 15 minutes. It's a nice addition, but it doesn't stand out from any other quest.

My favorite games this year has been BOTW and Hat in Time, but I do believe Assassins Creed Origins is going to have to join them. It is honestly a relief that Origins is what it is. It's a breath of fresh air the series needed.

Simply not fun.

Kills are not satisfying as in previous games, and it completely ruins the flow when you assassinate a target and have to 'confirm kill'

I've been sitting a while on this one, not knowing if I want to review it or not, I just couldn't settle for a good enough reason or reasons to give this game a proper 'yes' or a strong 'no'. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either, it has it's issues, some things feel good but others don't. This game is like a gray puddle, if you will.

It has a lot of decent content, it definitely isn't a great game, it has some flaws, but I don't dislike it, I think I like it.

The game has a HUGE world map, and it is as diverse as it is beautiful. I found myself wondering around for many hours at the beggining of the game, and I still do it, now and then, I just call my trusted steed, and ride slowly into the sunset.

Taking on the gorgeous surroundings, the deserts, cities, villages, of the ancient Egypt.

Ubisoft did an excellent job making the map, the world, the feel of it is just as good as one could expect. I for one, who loves history, I couldn't but almost find myself with tears in my eyes at the first sight of Alexandria, Memphis and the Pyramids. It shows that extra year of development the game had. It really does.

THE STORY, it is decent, not something that has not been told before in an Assassin's Creed game, it is one of revenge, but stands out from the others, it has a unique feel to it, as it is empowered by Bayek, who is alomst a force of nature, relentless, ruthless, and his anger towards the ones that wronged him may seem madness, yet one could only agree with it, as we all have a bit of madness in there. He is a husband, to a woman as driven and strong willed as he is. Both taking on the same quest to find the one responsible for their loss. Both sharing the same path, as a wife and husband should. Both Bayek and Aya, are in my eyes probably the best main characters in a Assassin's Creed game since Ezio's trilogy.

I'd like to add that I haven't finished the main story yet. I'm close to doing it though, but I take my time with it.

Along with the main quests, I found some of the side quest really well written, some not so much, but they weren't bad.
There are plenty of them, and if that is not enough there are a bunch of question marks on the map that will reveal forts, camps, bandit camps, treasure, tombs and hunting grounds. There are a lot of things to do.

THE COMBAT AND STEALTH, well I feel both good and bad about those two, as they both have good moments and bad ones.

The combat it is If I dare say, like in the Dark Souls games, also taking inspiration from the Witcher. To me it feels more Dark Souls than Witcher, but it is nothing near as good or polished, But you get used to it pretty quick. It may feel like a bad thing for some and that the way it has been till now was perfect, it wasn't. It felt so damn stupid before, as you could clear a whole city of guards just by waiting for one to attack so that you counter and kill all that was there to be killed. This feels much better, even with all the issues it has.

Stealh, is to easy, I play the game on Hard, and it just doesn't feel good enough, I mean, you simply just whistle from a bush and wait for the enemy to approach then you go in for the kill, similar to Black Flag, in many ways it just doesn't have the same think before you act, Syndicate had to a somewhat degree. In Origins, it just feels way to easy.
I got the achivement which required to kill 10 enemies on a row without being detected, in a camp in an area above my level without even breaking a sweet, early in the game. That just felt...wrong, I'm not that good, am I ?

PERFORMANCE, I did not encounter any big FPS drops or STUTTERS in the game, I have around 55-60 outside the big cities, and 30-45 in them, Alexandria just takes a giant crap on my 1070, literally. :).
Though Ubisoft says it's not because of the anti-crack thing the game has, which makes the CPU go nuts, I don't think a great deal about it, I could say I don't care...but I probably do, as I hate MY FPS BEING STUCK AT 30. I just look at that FPS counter and...Ah ! You don't want to know...
I almost didn't address this issue in my review because it didn't make the game unplayble, I expected it to have a bad optimisation...

Overall, Assassin's Creed Origins, It's a good game, I enjoyed playing and I think I will keep on enjoing it.
I recommend it to some people, mostly those that love the Assassin's Creed games, that played since Altair and didn't stop at the mess that was Unity and kept hoping for a good game, this is a decent one.
But to the rest, those that are 'fresh' to it or those that played the most recent ones, if you like the game from watching youtube gameplays or want to try it just because you heard it to be good from friends, buy it, but you would also like to consider buying during a sale.

I have to say the same for those wondering about the DLCs, It is not gonna be The Witcher 3 kinda ones, don't expect any 30hrs content, it's not going to happen, if you don't dream of that, good, I don't either. If it does happen. well, f*** me, I was wrong.

Assassins Creed was never my favorite series. I far favored games like Fallout, Skyrim, and others. It was such a shame too because they had such promise. The idea of assassins in historical times was always one that would excite me, but these were undercut with poor, predictable stories, glitchy mechanics and long swathes of boring missions. Origins changes all of this. The story captures attention immediately, drawing sympathy for Bayek and setting up the game like never before. Like previous Assassins Creeds, it captures all the historical aspects and events from the time period but makes them personal and causes deep reflection. The mechanics are near perfect. Your character can tell when you want to jump off a ledge, climb up a building, or fall from a great height. Unlike previous games where you could get stuck on a 2 foot ledge unable to make your character jump off, Origins delivers the perfect balance between fast running along rooftops without getting stuck and sneaky walking without accidentally falling off ledges. Lastly: the missions. Obviously with a game the size of this, not all missions can be fun and unique, but Origins comes very close. There are small follow missions now, instead of 20 minute long times where you just walk through a town following two people. Pretty much every other mission is unique in some way (except for Assassination missions, but those are more fun and challenging than unique). I also love the connection between magic and science, with curses and gods being mentioned often but then turning out to be something mundane. Overall I would give a 10/10, and it is possibly the best game I have ever played.

After, playing this game. i must say it is really very amazing, the graphics, the game mechanics, physics, the detailing, everything in the game have done quite well.
the only thing is fps drop issues i face at the combat time, that is a minor thing in my opnion, i know patch will be coming to fix the issues.

for those guys who have put negative reviews on the steam, just one thing i wanna say, wait. small issues will be patched soon.

A must buy Game, Ancient Egypt is really Beautiful.

I was boycotting Assassin's Creed after the terrible embarassment that was Assassin's Creed Unity. Then after watching gameplay and hearing almost nothing but good things about Origins, I bought it.
There were a few bugs in the beginning, including my entire PC audio cutting off upon game launch.(fixed by switching from 7.1 to 5.1 or vise versa) And the very first tutorial failing to start an animation, requiring me to restart the application.
Upon writing this I'm about ~10hours in and thoroughly enjoying the gameplay. Nothing feels like a chore. So far, everything in the game that you're tasked with just feels fun.
