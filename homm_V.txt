It's good, but you're better off buying the stand-alone expansion Tribes of the East, which includes all the content from this game and a bunch of other stuff for the same price. Only buy this one if you want to play the campaign.

This has to be my favorite game, probably ever.
Played countless amounts of hours when I had it on a disc back in 2011-2012, and I got all of my friends to play it.
This game was a huge blast for me and will always have a place in my heart.

Heroes of Might and Magic V is a turn based strategy game in a long series which started back in 1995 with Heroes of Might and Magic: A Strategic Quest and has been an extremely popular and successful strategy game for many years with the 6th game in the series coming out in October of 2011. As mentioned, HoMM V is a turn based strategy game where you control one hero for each army. The hero has 8 slots for 8 different units but they can have as many units as they would like under their command with that unique unit. The different units include classes such as archers, soldiers, cavalry, archangels and devils, ghosts, ghouls and many more. When your hero travels along the map they can pick up different relics and items that can increase attack, defense, luck, moral and other abilities and items that will help in a battle. They hero can only travel so far per day and after they are done they pass their turn on to the other opposing player whether that be AI or Human.
During their turn they can fight any enemies within their range which in turn starts a battle with a grid like system. These battles are also turn based and are based on the units speed not necessarily strict turn order. If an archer gets a lucky shot in they can get a boost and moral and actually go again either right after or sometime before their original turn order. Some units are faster than others; for example, griffins can go twice before the peasants even go once.

During the game the player can also take over cities, towns and keeps. The main city can be upgradable which allows you to build different units and upgrade others. Along with that the player can also higher other mercenary heroes that can have their own armies and travel around under the player’s control. Towns and keeps have certain units tied to them that each week replenish and can be bought by the heroes to add to their armies. In order to upgrade/build buildings and buy these units the player must capture strategic resources all along the map that include wood, ore, gems, mercury, sulfur, crystal and gold.

The story is a pretty simple one and spans across 6 different campaigns (the expansions add 2 more) which include Haven, Inferno, Necropolis, Dungeon, Sylvan and Academy. I only got through the first campaign as the game is very long but in this one Isabel the Queen is about to get married to King Nicolai when the demon invasion causes them to get separated and she is working towards getting back with the King while killing as many demons on the way as she can. She eventually finds him dying from some demonic spell that Agrael, a demon, attacks him with and is determined to get revenge against all demons and after which the dying king declares her ruler of the Holy Griffin Empire when he dies.

The graphics of the game are fairly basic and even for their time they weren’t anything special. In 2006 when we saw this game launch we saw other RTS and TBS games such as Empire at War, Company of Heroes and Warhammer 40k. So even if I was judging this by today’s standards it didn’t really even live up to the standards of 2006 when the game launched. Though there isn’t anything really wrong with the graphics, they just feel dated and not as impressive as other games of the time. There was one thing that kept bugging me about the game and that would be the camera. You couldn’t click on different items in the world without moving it around or if there was a fog of war it forced the unit to go all the way around or wouldn’t allow the unit to go forward at all.
The Sound was also equally bland and the music was very repetitive. The music didn’t so much get in the way or be annoying it just didn’t change very much. The voice acting wasn’t anything special but it wasn’t awful either. However the sound effects were unique for each unit so there is that. The biggest thing for me however was the setting the game was in. There are so many different areas and creatures in the game that it made for a very interesting adventure through the first campaign just getting to know this world.

Overall I can’t really compare this to any other game in the series as I haven’t played them however I have really enjoyed the gameplay of the game so much that it made me want to buy the 6th game in the series since I know the graphics have been vastly improved and look very impressive. I am giving the game a little boost in rating due to the limits of technology at the time however my 5 tiers are what the game rates to today’s standards.
• Story - 2 out of 5
• Gameplay – 5 out of 5
• Graphics – 2.5 out of 5
• Sound - 2 out of 5
• Fun – 5 out of 5
Pros:
- Great Turn based gameplay
- Can be Hard and rewarding
- A nice learning curve
- Interesting world and lore
Cons:
- Music/Sound are ok, nothing thrilling
- Story is ok however the world is great
- Irritating Camera

I’m giving a Total score of 74%

When it came out, I bought the original CD. 2006 I was a kid and I just played it for fun.
4 years later I played it and from then on it became my favourite game ever! I finished all the campaigns!
8 years later I bought it for steam and will play it again just because this game deserves it!

8/10 for Graphics (for a game that came out in 2006 it's badass)
8/10 for Gameplay (turn based game in this game is fine)
9/10 for Story (best fantasy story game I ever played)
10/10 for music and soundtracks (I think this is the best part of this game)

If you want to start to playing Might and Magic, I recommend starting with V!
Here on V you have more factions to play, and the play style is different on each one. The first missions are too simple and you can't enjoy that much playing with Heaven (people, knights and angels) but when you start playing with necromancy (spoiler alert) you will be able to play with Heaven too.
I like this game because it's somewhat difficult... You need to calculate your moves, take troops in all your cities and strike enemy only if they don't have reinforcements... And most of the times you need run away from the enemy just because they have thousands of troops and you have few peasants.
The final battle of the final mission gives you something different... (spoiler) You will be able to play a battle with 5 heroes.
The expansions like Tribes of the East and Hammers of Fate are awesome too but the original MMH5 is better...

Update: This game works perfectly for me on windows 10 as well!

Okay first off, for all those who want this game but read the system requirements and thought "Oh drat, I cannot play this on my system, I have a windows 8 and it says up to XP only". I have GREAT news for you-I have this game, on a cheap 350 dollar notebook from walmart. It has a windows 8 OS. This game-runs PERFECTLY on it. I did not even need to change or alter any compatibility settings or mess with the graphics or audio configuration. On default layout, no changes at all-it runs perfectly. Now, obviously, I cannot guarantee this will be true for absolutely everyone. I can however say given how cheap my own computer system is-I think this game would work for almost everyone running a windows 8 system. Probably also the same with windows 7 but I cannot say for certain on that one.

Now onto the game itself. Heroes of Might and Magic series is a well known and well loved series for a number of good reasons. First of all, there are different races, all with their unique units and hero specializations. This particular Heroes of Might and Magic is I feel the best of the series so far (Yes, better even that Might and Magic Heroes VI.) The graphics are fine if not great, but the game itself is what makes this game so much fun. With both single player, multiplayer, and even hot seat player capability you can play with friends far or near, or solo. It has campaigns for each race, all of which combine into one epic story on love, loss, and each faction.race fighting to survive and rule over all.

Combat is laid out on a open fiend or fighting to defend or gain control of a castle/keep with wall fortifications between you and the enemy. You have control over all of your units and can even through leveling you hero, gain control over the war machines in your unit such as the first aid tent, the ballista, and the catapult, allowing you to heal the units of your choice or aim the ballista at a particular target, or have the catapult try and take out only the door or remove the turret towers aimed at you as a example.

The units themselves can have special abilities. For example, the demon units can use a skill called gating, to summon up more of their own kind to join you for the battle (These gated units are temporary and vanish after each battle). The Undead units with the help of their hero can rise again after death, and if you defeat living targets, can even spend dark energy points to raise them again as undead units in your army (the type of unit they turn into depends on how powerful they were before). The list goes on.

Outside of the campaigns which are fun and throw new challenges at you to keep the game fresh and fun (and also tie into the storyline perfectly), such as having to avoid a enemy or outrun them to a safe zone to meet up with a particular hero or town. Other times you have one week to take over a town and set up camp before having to wipe out the enemy that stands in your way and so on.

The game play itself has a little learning curve, to understand what different objects on the map do for you, and figuring out how best to defeat units or how to control your own to the best advanatage-but the learning curve is built into the storyline so you are not derailed by some overtly lengthly tutorial. You simply learn as you progress and by the mid-part of the very first campaign, you'll be a expert hand at building up your keep, controlling your units, and understanding how to level your hero to your advanatage (Though more time playing with all the races will be needed to fully see what is the best way to level a particular hero).

Each hero has it's own unique talent as well. There is a elven hero who has a powerful ranged strike and boosts the damage of all it's groups hunter (archer) units. There is a demon hero whose spedciality is making each ballista shot explosive, doing extra damage each time the ballista's turn comes around. There is a Magic Hero who specializes with the smallest of units, the gremlins, who jhave a ranged blunderbuss shot attack that means a huge army of many small minions with a combined strength enough to take down far more powerful units of lesser numbers. The list again goes on. So it is in your interest to read up when you build your tavern, where you recruit new heroes, to see what each hero does and choose the one whose specialization you need most-someone who can race over the landscape and explore it our simply outrun the enemy, someone who brings extra firepower, or someone more specialized for a particular foe or to best defend your keep while you take your main hero out into the fray.

The game is, in fact-complete in every sense as is, but if you finish the campaigns and want more-good news again! There are two expansion campaign games for this game (look at the DLC for the game or buy the whole collection at once for $19.99 USD). Each one adds a new race and continues the storyline. First, the dwarven race and then the orcs-also calle dht eribes of the East.) I highly recommend both expansions as the races are fun, enjoyable, and and a completely fresh set of skills and tech and units to the game. The orcs are particularly amusing, as you can have cyclops through goblin in a kamikaze fashion into the face of enemy units. It only costs one mere goblin, the cheapest of units, to do a massive damage spray with the help of your powerful cyclops' throwing arm.

If you love having complete control over a army, a castle, and a hero-if you enjoy besieging castles and trampling the enemy under hoof and claw, if you have ever enjoy any turn based, fantasy game with a bit of storyline-then this game is for you. You will NOT be dissapointed by it.

For this game by itself without the DLC, it costs a mere $9.99 and offers many hours of gameplay and has endless replayability with the multiplayer mode (Which you can play solo as well against as few as one or up to 8 AI competitors).

So really, there is no reason to NOT buy this game unless you truly despise everything turn based.Even then, this game may well change your mind or at least make you willing to put up with the turn based combat for the sheer fun of everything else about the game.

Have you ever read reviews stating a game is so good, that the reviewer just needs one more turn?
This game is such a game more than most games, imo.

So, many years ago when I was a teenager, I played Heroes of Might & Magic 3 and 4
alongside other few top classics, such as the Age of Empires games.

Therefore, I decided to buy the fifth installment in this game series in the Steam summer sale,
as I never got to play it.

And, I didn't regret it. The game has the same old feel to it, as the other older games in the series.
You can tell by the graphics, that this game is from 2006, but it doesn't matter.
Gameplay is awesome! The graphics are neat and the music is making the game immersive.

The exploration, combat system and fantasy setting is better than most.
The gameplay is deep, but you can jump right into the game, and try it out,
untill you get it, without getting frustrated or confused about the gameplay.

Here I am in the middle of the night, wanting just to play half an hour before going to bed,
but almost three and an half hour has surpassed/flown away, and I had to close the game,
because I really need sleep.

9,5/10 for epic classic turn-based strategy.
One of the best on the market, if you like these types of games.

Pretty darn good stuff.

Purists (much like Resident Evil purists) will say that it sucks balls, that it doesn't even touch the shining paragon that is HoMM 3, that it should never have seen the light of day, blah blah blah

♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's as good, even maybe slightly better than HoMM 3. With expansions mind you.

All the races end up being really balanced (with the expansions lol) while still having a VAST array of differing unit, hero and ability choices. That alone is quite a feat.

But on top of that is a killer art style, a fabulously rendered world map, and an updated (for the better, morale was way way overpowered in HoMM3) combat system

Peak point of the franchise, a worthy successor the nostalgia of Heroes II and III. The classic gameplay and the incredibly well designed 3D cities, combat finally got mixed together the right way, every way. While the graphics certainly look aged at this point and you have to get a widescreen mod for it too (takes like 5 seconds of googling), writing this in 2016 I can say the game is old enough now to have a nostalgia wave when you think about it, and the graphics certainly support the good looking and well designed desired quality measure, while looking just old enough for your fantasy to fill the rest.

The singleplayer campign is while full of tiresome and cringeworthy dialogue, has interesting characters and character development (!), if you stick around for a few missions to let it unfold. The skirmish battles are needless to say, what keep this game ageless. Too bad multiplayer got shut down, because even if I didn't play it once, the extra mode that was a single combat with selectable premade heroes and armies was great. Local co-op of course still exists, if you can get people sitting next to you in front of your PC for like 2 days... oh man I miss the '00s.

I have always loved the Heroes of Might and Magic games, because I grew up playing Heroes 2 and 3. I didn't play 4 that much, but I've REALLY enjoyed playing Heroes 5. It has the best of everything I loved about my old memories.

Firstly, if you're going to buy it DON'T BUY THIS VERSION. Tribes of The East is not just an expansion pack, it's a newer version of the game that supports widescreen etc. Sadly ToTE doesn't have the original missions for some bizarre reason, but there is a community backport you can download to give you them back. So in short, buy the ToTE version and download the original campaign mod, NOT this one. The software build on this is inferior.

Anyway, reviewing the game beyond that. It's still a thumbs down. Love the premise, the core concept and mechanics, but it's poorly executed.

It's not until many many hours and several levels/campaigns/maps (can't remember the definition) down the line until you meet your first real enemy player. There is an enemy player prior but he just sits there and doesn't do anything. Anyway it's supposedly an AI enemy "player", unlike a scripted linear game, after your turn there is a progress bar comes up as the computer takes its turn. So as this is a strategy game, I'm building my army and exploring the map, gradually making my way towards the enemy. I've killed any "champions" (mobile armies) he's thrown at me so far, and have got all the roads covered, when suddenly, a brand new army just spontaneously appears waaaay behind my lines right next to some vulnerable towns etc. And this is a turn based game, and all my units are wayyy over the other side of the map. And teleporting is not a game mechanic, basically the computer just cheated. Plus I'd conquered most of the resources by now and defeated his armies, and this guy spawned with a pretty decent army, so where did that come from? So because my units are so far away now, it's basically game over. This is NOT strategy, if you were to be generous you'd call it random and unexpected, at worse outright cheating; either way it was impossible to strategise against, so that's about 20 hours gameplay wasted that I've got to do all over again rather than following the storyline. Bearing in mind that this game is very very slow and very very long winded. And there's quite a lot of micromanagement involved. So at this point I thought sod it, never played it again since.

I say "at that point", because it wasn't the first time I almost abandoned it. The levelling up system isn't the normal intuitive tree based one where you can look where you're choices are headed and plan accordingly. Nope, instead it just pops up a screen with 4 options, which are randomly generated, and have no explanation of their future consequences. For this reason you think it can't be a big deal and just pick one. About 40 hours of gameplay down the line you begin to realise that there is tree style-ish levelling, and that it's so complicated there is an interactive circle available on the interenet to help you understand your choices. Why did the game not tell me this 40 hours ago when I made base decisions building a charachter I'm now stuck with and can't change!??

To exacerbate all these problems, there's no reset skill tree, and no saved game editors available on the web. Trainers and cheats are very sparse too, and at best you can get more gold or something (I ended up giving up with the cheats and 3rd party utils I couldn't get to work, and used Cheat Engine), but you can't fix the screwed up decisions the game has mislead you into.

So again to summarise, love the idea - the combat, the units, the music, the animations, the strategy (until it screws you around as explained above); but it's just a really poorly executed game. I was considering buying the newer ones and see if they're any better, but despite being many years old they're still about £20 each, and if this one's anything to go by I wouldn't spend more than a fiver on them.

I like Heroes V more than Heroes III.

First, my review:
Game is great, for every hardcore- OR casual-turn-based-strategy-fan. Heck, even most people I know who HATE turn-based-strategy like this game! It somehow manages to be accessible and ungodly replayable at the same time. It must have to do with the cozy feeling inside whenever you visit your capitol...

NOW, why I prefer Heroes V over III:

Advantages of III:
- MUCH better random map generator + more preconstructed maps. Overall much more replayability (meaning, while V only offers 500 hours of fun, III easily manages to go above 1.000)
- MUCH better overworld map. Cleaner.
- Slightly faster gameplay overall.

Advantages of V:
Almost EVERYTHING I wished to be improved in III has been improved in V:
- more and more balanced spells (no more ♥♥♥♥♥ Town Portal and Teleport for you, sire asshl-mage)
- more and more balanced skills for heroes
- military units have more and more individual abilities and offer more variation via flexible upgrade-system
Two more things (I didn't even dare to wish):
- each race is much more individual, has much more recognition value (each has their own heroes (with skills only
available to THIS ONE RACE), "Dungeon" (a hodgepodge of mystic creatures) is now Dark Elves, "Elves" (a hodgepodge
of fantasy creatures) is now Wood Elves, "Orcs" are now true Orcs, and "The Swamp Stuff" (a hodgepodge of greek
mythology... I don't know, I don't care) is gone for good (The Dwarves)
- Entering a city is now awe-inspiring (especially humans, wood elves and undead are great)

With nostalgia ruling my rating: 5 out of 5 stars.

Without nostalgia ruling my ratings: still a solid 4 of 5 stars.

For this game meant a lot throughout my childhood. This game turned out to be fundamental to my imagination growing up as a preteen and teenager: I imagined commanding great armies of Angels and Titans, casting Meteor Showers and fireballs, ruling castles or cities in the sky, visiting magic towers, meeting charismatic heroes all from this game. My Steam hours do not indicate truly how much time I put into this game growing up, for I originally owned the box set of 4 cd-roms.

The story is actually quite fantastic. It is appropriately epic and at times out of proportion, fitting for heroes and living legends. But I'll be frank: the voice acting cast butchers the few lines they have... some story that the employees of Ubisoft were the voice actors, versus professionals. The characters are all memorable to this day, partly because the cast is fairly small and distinct from each other, and the heroes seem to radiate a believable charisma where I could imagine how an army of hundreds of Paladins and Angels would charge under Godric's banner, for example.

The setting was expansive and imaginative. This game fired my imagination as a child and fueled it for about a decade. The battle mechanics are perhaps the selling point of this game series. At this point, and having played this game for over several hundred hours, I can rattle to you all the creatures and stats and perks and effects like an expert. I've beaten this game time and time again at the most difficult level simply to practice my tactics and strategy. I know perhaps every corner of each map, including obscure easter eggs (such as the little toy tank in the bottom-left corner of Campaign 1, Mission 4).

Paul Romero's score was perhaps the secret ingredient to the magic of this game. He employs a theme and variations: the Dies Irae from the very opening menu provides the material for almost half of the music. Each faction's theme is some subtle variation of that opening, the most memorable being the Haven theme and Academy themes. Individual heroes have their own themes too, which are all very rallying. Individual themes are great for learning associations: Zehir's theme plays when he's on screen; Findan's theme plays when he's centerstage. The terrain music peppers the scenarios and are not derived from the Dies Irae theme; they are their own things. Only Romero gets away with parallel 8ths, parallel 4ths and 5ths and makes such passages in his music sound truly medieval. Prior to discovering the Nihon Falcom SDK sound team that has written the music scores for the Trails in the Sky series, I held this game's music score for about a decade as the very best music a game could have. I still consider it fantastic music that reignites nostalgia.

I feel that the only reason this game drops from 5 to 4 stars over the years has been simple exposure to a wider array of games that have also duly impressed me for other reasons. With better contextualizing this game, I dropped one star because the voice acting single-handedly takes off a half of a star, and I believe nostalgia naturally guilds my experiences. This is still one of the most original RPG games out there and a gem. The expansions to this game frankly break my heart, and Heroes VI and VII are botched. Heroes V original stands out in the series.

Heroes of Might & Magic V

A great game. The HOMM series has always been good in my opinion and this game doesn't still disappoint the series for me considering i have played every game except for 6 and 7, but so far the games from 1 to 5 have been great.
Comparing this to HOMM3 the one on Steam aka the HD Edition then this is a 9.5/10 for doing a lot of things similar that 3 to HD did, but also for doing a lot of things different and leaving the right things in place still.

Heroes V is a strategy game made by Nival in 2006. The story is basically a fantasy world where demons attack humans, and other races join the war... and stuff like this. Graphics are pretty nice, dubs are really good, and the gameplay made this game alive for a very long period of time.
Graphics - 10/10, its just perfect.
Story - 9/10, could've been a bit better, especially that every HoMM V's final campaign ends like if the whole game has ended.
Gameplay - 10/10, playing with others on one computer is a great option as well.
Mechanics - 9/10, there actually are some bugs here.
Modifications and Fanbase - 10/10, great people and great modifications, though some (Crimson Necropolis, Conflux) are too overpowered.
Final Rating - 9.6/10

First of all I need to say that I spent hundreds of hours playing Heroes I, II, and III. I've also played IV and VI. Heroes is the game of my childhood in the 90's. No matter how nostalgic I am about the first games of the series, Heroes V is a really great game that I can recommend to any of you. Good character development system, really well written story, multi heroes battles etc. make this a well polished product. Thumbs up to Ubisoft for making this one happen (and thumbs down for still having excuses on not releasing DLC's for Heroes III HD on Steam, which is a complete shame - but that's a whole different story...).

This is where my HOMM journey ended. (Well this and two expansions.) Tried VI and didn't like it. Liked the storyline of II and the content of IV (moving armies manually w/o heroes and the extra faction). Didn't like III as much because Dimension Door spell cheapened map travel and was OP endgame. It's definitely my 'just one more turn' two-hours later addiction and the map editor adds loads of replayability. It's a relaxing, simple game that can be minimized by pressing the Windows key w/o any issue when you want to do something else like browse, binge, etc. I like a wide variety of games like FPS, MMORPG, TBS (like this) and have played many over the years, but always come back to this when I take a break from the rest. Can't say the same for most games less than 12yrs (to the day) from release.

In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#429 out of 612)... it's time for Heroes of Might & Magic V.

The venerable Heroes of Might & Magic series more or less peaked with the classic strategy game, Heroes of Might and Magic III. The fifth game here belongs to an entirely new developer, and it succeeds more or less at updating the HoMM formula for the modern era—so much so that many consider it to be the second-best game in the series.

The core premise of Heroes of Might & Magic is that it's a turn-based tactical strategy game filled with familiar high fantasy tropes and countless genre cliches. It can err, perhaps, by taking itself to seriously, but is largely more concerned with being fun and engaging even if it's also rather cheesy at times. Mechanically HoMMV has a fair amount of depth to it, but lacks many quality-of-life features that feel essential to SRPGs today (combat, especially, feels much slower than it ought to). The story is competently delivered, but nothing terribly impressive. All in all it's a solid game, if perhaps slightly underwhelming, and a worthy successor to one of the most stories tactical strategy RPGs in the Western pantheon.

Note: Also played on PC, sans-Steam.

I've played all of the Heroes of Might and Magic games, and this is by far my favorite. The castles are one of the best things about this game. The (optional) cinematic upon entering a city is amazing.

Very interesting, endless variations. Some goofy plotlines - you cannot win certain quests, ever.
After recent Windows updates, the game has become unplayable - crashes every 10 minutes and won't load saved game.

After the abysmal Heroes of Might and Magic IV, Heroes V went back on track again, feeling a lot more like my personal all-time favourite HoMM III. Heroes V did almost everything right: It was a graphical update, didn't change core gameplay beyond comparison, had a great balance of exploration and combat, great creature trees, good art design, good sound and only was a partial letdown regarding the uninspired campaigns which felt a bit like just having been added in there for namesake only, each of the 6 campaigns being no longer than 5-6 missions.

Heroes V is still very much fun to play today, scales nicely to 4k and has zero technical hiccups. Not the best Heroes, but a very solid one and therefore more than recommended along with its addons for fans of the franchise.

The last good HoMM game.

I would definitely recommend buying this one with both DLCs for 15$ on the next sale. You'll get a pretty long vanilla campaign(~100 hours on heroic) plus 2 DLCs continuing the original story (~about 50 hours each). If you have friends that are into HoMM, there is also local (hot-seat) and online multiplayer; unfortunatelly, the official servers are shut down, so you'll have to use hamachi or something similar to play online.

After you get bored with vanilla, you should install a community made mod (HoMM 5.5). It fixes a lot of the issues of the original game: fixes AI, changes balance and adds artifacts and new game mechanics.

P.s: Don't try heroic difficulty, if you're not ready to lose hours of progress on certain missions. The difficulty curve of the single player campgains looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ roller coaster. Everything up to mission C3M3 is a cakewalk, but after that, oh boy, you're going to take a beating.

Being a Hero’s of Might and Magic noob and quite pedantic (every hero must visit every shrine for every upgrade) the game played quite well, even after I read that you should rush the stages quickly to keep the next levels army size down (it’s refreshing to be punished for taking a stupid amount of time). The battles were fun, large affairs that took time and patience to win, but every battle felt rewarding, and there was a sense of achievement. I breezed through the first few races, then I come to the Sylvan (elf) quest line and I swear the game is broken. I swear there is no way to finish some of these missions. Units that should be able to be removed from a garrison can’t be after a certain level patch, which makes re-enforcing your home town impossible. The only way around is to have a running battle with weak sacrificial units and hope you do enough damage each turn to whittle them down before they hit your main town. Other than that 1 glaringly painful part of the game, it was quite fun to play. Each race plays differently (they are all unique), and while you could make most hero’s semi similar with loadouts, they work well enough with their faction’s units that I didn’t feel a need.

I found the plot interesting and it contained enough twists and turns early on to keep me invested until I finished it. The characters dialogue is well written, and while some of the humor falls flat I found myself chuckling enough when it was trying to be humorous.

The two expansions also play very well, although I found some of the balancing made some races/units very over powered. I thought the overall difficulty increased with the 2 expansions (especially with the tribes of the east expansion). Having the different unit upgrade paths was interesting, and brought new options to the field. Be prepared to sink a lot of time into playing it (this isn’t something you can rush through- though I’m sure someone will prove me wrong in this). If you are a fan of turn based strategy games then I would recommend this. No achievements for this game (it must be one of the few that doesn’t have them).

"Perfectly average" is the rating I would give. I've played all the other Heroes games, and I'm still undecided whether I like Heroes 3 or 4 better. That being said, Heroes 5 is a lot like 3, with virtually the same gameplay and mechanics, and very little new material. Just more of the same stuff I've seen before, but now in 3D.

Whether you're a fan of the Heroes of Might & Magic series or stradegy game fan in general, this game is a definite must have. Like it's predecessors you have a castle which you must build up by collecting resources and producers on the field. Create buildings and upgrade them to hire/recruit, fantastical creatures to your cause and crush your enemies. The story is decent, but the cg added into the series is well done and appropriate.

I had forgotten how much fun the HoMM games were.
A bit slow by todays action game standards but fun none the less.
Turn based strategy goodness.
If you have played any of the games in this HoMM series or the King's Bounty series then you know this is more of the same.
This game has more cut scenes for story telling than I remember but you can watch or skip them to your liking
It has OK / good graphics and there is not much else to say about it.

Heroes of M & M 5 is a good game, a bit dated but a solid Fantasy Turn Based Strategy with RPG elements.

TBS is a niche genre and sometimes intimidating, but Heroes has simple and easy gameplay, you control heroes who must explore the scenarios in search of goals and has troops to assist you in combat. Just like on the scenario map, combat is turn based and also easy to understand as well as the towns managing. The AI is good and challenging, tricky sometimes. Is graphically outdated but perfectly playable, the weak point is the animation of campaign cut-scenes, badly made.

The overall campaign is ridiculously large, there are 6 factions and each has a campaign with 5 phases with a storyline that connects them, the plot has no big deal and the feeling that remains is that the campaign was made to play and better understand each faction in case of playing in skirmish mode.

Being long the campaign becomes tiresome and the heroes skill system is a bit complicated to understand. I had performance issues and the game only opened when installed in the same directory with Steam. I recommend this game for those who enjoy strategy, fantasy, and looking for something different then RTS or with a slower pace.

I have fond memories of my father playing this game when I was a child and I would watch how he defeated demons and necromancers alike. Nowadays I'm the one playing it to see how the story ends. The graphics are a bit outdated, but it's just like I remembered. I'd pay good money to see the same game with nicer grapics. 10€ is definitely worth it :)

WARNING:

Game will destroy your sleeping pattern. Do not play if you have any obligations to anything. Oh and also don't upgrade peasants to conscripts you lose the daily gold bonus. Most fights can be won with puppet master or frenzy, conjure pheonix is excellent for fighting creatures that can't be mind controlled though. Never put a stack of mages behind your own units, you will accidentally kill them. Markal reminds me of Scar from the Lion King. Isabel is just tragic. Just play this game, seriously.

I was introduced to the Heroes series in 1996 with the release of HOMM II. I've played 1-5 and I must say that HOMM V is my favorite. I felt that it was a great update with graphics as well as mechanics. HOMM III is also fantastic. The first two were great in the series but I don't revisit them often due to their age and dated game design. I've logged 406 hours of HOMM V through Steam - that doesn't count all the hours I spend playing the CD/DVD-ROM version on release!

Re-downloaded for some nostalgia. I have way more hours via my disc from back in the day. I had even bought a couple of copies for friends back in 2015 and we would play late into the nights. Everyone talks about HoMM3, but V is really a gem-- no complaints at all and highly recommend it.

I really recommend this game even nowadays with the Heroes VI and VII. This one is far better made.

Great game ! use to play the 2nd one when I was 10, 100s of hours in that one, this one is looking the same.. everything runs smooth graphics are great, sounds better. and the map details are great aswell.. gameplay is very easy, only takes about 10 or 15 min to figure out, but if you do the main quest the first 2 missions are pretty much lessons. Its deff worth the money for the amount of hours you WILL sink into it lol.

Despite it's flaws, HOMM5 is a great work done from the developers - the old feel of homm3 is still alive with graphical updates and the towns look stunning. The creatures have little to desire more from, and are perfectly suitable the way they are. The big nerf to the necromancer ability is a slight disappointment although it is more balanced than the necromancer in homm3 was. I'd give the game:

Heros of Might & Magic V is a classic game of epic strategy. This game combines turn-based, army-oriented combat with RPG-like logistics to grow the various forces. Instead of clicking on a building to query up troops, you must either send out your general out to rally them, or recruit them from you town. It's a refresting, and unique take, on the stregy genre of games.

The graphics of this game havn't aged very well, as with most games published around the same time as this one. Also, it's art style is pretty much a rip-off of the Warhammer Fantasy tabletop game. But that is basically what this game is: "Warhammer: the Campign". And thats not a bad thing.

If the idea of a semi-casual, low-APM, army campign game sounds even mildly interesting, then you'll love this game. Just, try not to look the in-game characters in they eyes during dialoge. The uncanny valley is strong here, after all.

The Heroes of Might & Magic series is probably the one, apart from The Elder Scrolls, that has devoured the most of my time.
It started with HoMM3, that I was introduced to by my friends in 5th or 6th grade, and I ordered it soon after that.
After playing HoMM3 for so many hours, I thought HoMM4 would be as good, but was deeply dissapointed when almost EVERYTHING was changed, from the town-system to hero-mechanics. Therefore, my hopes for HoMM5 were somewhat lower than what should have been appropriate, because HoMM5 brought back what HoMM3 was, in 3D graphics!
I have loved almost every hour spent on this title (it far exceeds the "105 hours" listed on steam, I had the game on CD years before even joining steam), and this one is a strong "Must buy"-title!
If you like tactical turn-based strategy set in a rich fantasy world with many different factions to choose from, this is the game for you! (If you want to go a bit more retro I would also recommende HoMM3, of course ;) )

200+ hours on Heroes V, need I say more? It's fun, it's basic, yet challenging. And you can play hot seat! This game may end my marriage, but we both love playing it, even if I always beat the pants off my wife.

Good game. I wholeheartedly recommend it. However, just to be clear, you only need to buy this if you are interested in the singleplayer campaigns. If you are buying this for the very good hotseat multiplayer experience, you ONLY need to get Tribes of the East. That includes all the features from all the expansions, but only includes the singleplayer campaigns from that particular expansion.

(I got this on sale, so even though I tend to prefer the multiplayer experience, it was low enough of a price for the singleplayer to be worth the $2.50 extra for each one.)

One of the best turn-based strategy games ever made. Incredible depth, stunning diversity and intricate systems make this an easy to learn but hard to master title. Besides all this, it still looks amazing 10 years later with just a simple shader patch. If you plan on getting it, only get the Tribes of the East game. You can patch the campaigns from the previous games (Heroes 5 and Hammers of Fate) and play all of the 13 campaigns on the Tribes version that contains every feature. That is the complete Heroes 5 experience and it holds up amazingly.

the best of the 6 that are out now. V has more factions to play than any previous or later game in the franchise. and when it comes right down to it the diversity is what makes this game entertaining.

Played this game for the first time when it came out and I was a kid, remembered that I absolutely loved this game back in the day, bought it again to see whether my memory of how great it is was clouded by nostalgia and loved the game once again just like when I was a kid.
Definitely recommend this game, It's great fun!

Good game, played a lot of it as a teenager. Glad to see it still plays well. The only problem is and it may be just me, is that i own the expansions and have them installed but they play as stand alone games. I have to load HoF to play as Fortress and and have to play TotE to play as Stronghold. This makes it impossible to play against all factions in the game at once.

The best HoMM game in the series IMO. I grew up playing HoMM 2 and got a physical copy of this game as soon as it came out. I've put hundreds of hours into it and still enjoy it to this day. After 5 the series takes a nose dive in the wrong direction - seriously, Ubisoft what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing to this series? I have the sixth game and it's 'playable' but won't be buying the 7th which is out now and looks like ♥♥♥♥. I hope the future of the franchise isn't beyond saving already - just revamp the old games with modern graphics and animations and my wallet is yours to violate how ever you please.

This is a fun and interesting game to play with friends and you can even play online or in hotseat.Unfortunately there is an even better version with more units.races,spells,events and maps called "heroes of might and magic five:tribes of the east".So I actually recommend getting that instead of this,still if you want to complete your set or just want to see the campaign of this game(which is really fun)go ahead and buy it.The gameplay and graphics are great.

Long time HOMM3 player here, and I thought 3 was the perfect game. Surprisingly, 5 is way better than 3, especially strategy wise. Everything is just right:
1. The skill system (certain skill leads to certain skills) is very well done. That's just exactly what I always wish it to be in 3. And skills are balanced, like Balistic revives your warmachine after each battle.
2. Better combat system. Added army deployment phase. Waiting mechanic is totally different, you can't just be a waiting scum to cheat computer AI anymore.
3. Great UI, very pleasent to play with, e.g. about combat deployment phase, it remembers how you deployed you army from last time so you don't have to do the same thing over and over again.
4. I like the campaign story, event trigger is just like WOW3.
5. Soundtrack is nice and soothing (I have only experienced Haven though).
6. ... (I didn't play long enough, but there are probably much more good things, like spells)

So far, there are two things that are negative:
1. It's a little hard to select and click objects on the map, thus wasting moving points. I think I just need to play a while to get used to it.
2. The graphic is off-putting (it feels like objects are being pressed), especially when watching other people play. I was discourged by it for a long time. I guess it's like kissing someone you love. It feels good regardless how your partner looks. Not that I have ever kissed anyone though.

Neutral points:
1. Towns are in 3D.
2. Everything trys to look cute, cartoon style. They look chubby, or one can say fat.

Overall experience is quite enjoyable. If you still can't decided, hear this out and thank me later. After play this for a few hours, I just don't think I can go back to play HOMM3 anymore.

It's Heroes, so you know what you're getting. It's old, so all the content is available and cheap. The graphics are decent and the gameplay is fun.

There's no more online multiplayer, but I was never really into that. The Network multiplayer mode is enough for me.

Probs one of the last good Might & Magic games.
The game is old so the graphics aren't very impressive but they aren't repulsive. The game is overall balanced (I think). It's a cool game to play in the background if you have 2 monitors and wanna watch something but not pay too much attention to it.

A superb entry in the Heroes franchis, Heroes V is exactly what you expect as a heroes fan. If you've never played Heroes before, I's like to recommend this title to you as an excellent intro to turn-based strategy gaming.

You basically run an empire, determined by the scenario setup, of a few towns, and can recruit army leaders ("heroes") to lead your forces to victory. The heroes level up, RPG-style, as they win combat encounters and explore the map, and the towns develop in a similar fashion, as you invest in them -- producing larger, more interesting armies as they get better.

Heroes is very much a strategic title, rather than a tactical one -- its true that bad tactics can lose you a battle very easily, but good tactics can't really best a vastly superior force, because the AI simply never plays in a manner to would allow you to overrun it, in a such a manner. You win the battle before it starts, as it were.

If you're into strategy, and high fantasy, this is a game for your library, plain and simple.

I spent nearly 2 hours trying to get into this game via skirmish. All I could think while I was playing was, "I could continue being bored ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or I could go play Heroes 3: Horn of the Abyss and play a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ XXXL randomly generated map and enjoy attempting to take the entire map."

I may not of given it much of a chance, but Heroes 3 has taken more hours of my life than all other Heroes games for a reason. It is still the best. Go buy GoG. com's complete Heroes Edition, download Horn of the Abyss mod, enjoy random maps for-ever.

10/10

As a long time HoMM fan, I am glad that this game was rereleased on Steam. When the game first came out, it was fraught with bugs and issues that needed to be patched. However, at long last, this great game is finally playable. In addition to what I loved about the original, I love that the monsters can now cast their own spells. Their distinct abilities also add a lot to the combat. The Town maps have also become much more beautiful! My only complaint is that there is not a Map Editor, which has been a staple of this game series since as far back as I can remember. While this one flaw weaks the replay value a little, the game is still well worth the money and time, as it is wicked fun!

It took me a bit to grow to like it, but I must say it's fun to hop into once in a while. I do however think That HoMM3 is much better especialy when it comes to the combat, I feel the whole initiative and speed in this one is an interesting addition for sure but I feel some of the defence focused, tanky creatures of higher levels, (eg treants) are really hurt by this especially when facing an enemy hero as they seem to do more damage to these sorts of creatures than lower level ones, also I find it quite hard to predict the turn order before the battle accurately.

Never the less I love how uniquely you can build each hero with really fun and novel skills and talents, this is really cool to mess around with, I would even go as far as to argue that it can give each hero a specific personality so much more than in HoMM3. Although if you played HoMM3 for as long as I have no doubt you wouldn't really have a problem with that ^^.

One thing I must specify is I have NOT played HoMM5 multiplayer, so I simply have no idea as to how that looks, (the AI can take it's time on it's turns sometimes ;p ) but If you like the basic concept of a HoMM game I would deffinately recommend this for hours of fun, especially with abit of imagination, I feel you can forgive some of it's flaws.

Game of my childhood
This game is amazing although the dlc ares not the best but they are kinda good aswell
HOMM5 and the HOMM3 are the best Heroes games for sure (I didnt tried the 6-7)
So is this game good enough in 2021?
No not rly
Vibe check:✅ yeah it got good ol' vibes
Price check: Its actually really cheap on sales so if you want you can buy the game really cheap aínd bring back the old memories (ubisoft dont deserve the money tbh)

Heroes of Might and Magic V is yet another attempt to revitalize the franchise. A new developer with a new vision, only the developer has no vision. This installment is in many ways just a recreation of Heroes III with a few features and some new technology. Unfortunately simply recreating an old game isn't enough to warrant a new purchase and the new features introduced does not quite meet the standard you would expect from a big name franchise like this.

Although the basic gameplay is still great there simply isn't enough new in the game to really consider it a continuation of the franchise. New features, like spell-less heroes getting a free attack and an initiative list that lets you see in what order units are going to get their turn, are nice additions to the core formula but they don't really add anything new to the game overall when not combined with more extensive overhauls and improvements.

One of the more significant additions to the game is the new racial abilities that helps distinguish between the heroes, separating them into more sub groups than the usual Melee vs Magic that previous games in the series used. Unfortunately, as with all such systems, without proper balance it adds very little and this was not properly balanced which makes much of what the system tries to do an exercise in futility. Once you realize which abilities are strong and which are weak you will pretty much only have one or two hero builds that are worth following, regardless of what racial abilities are available to you.

The second and without a doubt the biggest change to the game is the move to full 3D. The game sure looks pretty but a number of bugs, jerky camera movements and items on the map being obscured by the wrong camera angle detracts much from what should have been a major graphical improvement.

The multi-player is heavily marred by bugs and crash. In particular the out of sync issues makes it near impossible to finish a game online.

Heroes of Might and Magic IV is not a very notable step in any direction, it seems like the developers was so scared of doing any wrong that they ended up doing almost nothing at all which leaves us with what is just a prettied up Heroes III with a few new issues that need fixing.
Like Heroes III it is still an enjoyable game however because of many lacks and faults in the game you can't help but feel it is a step backwards for the franchise.

Heroes of might & magic is a strategy game that is quite low tech but, in my opinion, extremely fun to play. It can be challenging and you have to play it many times to keep learning about the different classes of heroes and their skills.

Excellent game! Played most of the Heroes games over the years, but this one is one of the best, if only because the missions in the campaign are much more varied than in previous games. The graphics are good, the gameplay is excellent and very compelling. Also, it's challenging without becoming stupidly difficult like HOMM 3 tends to do. If you enjoy turn-based strategy I can really recommend this one.

One of the criticisms I hear about this game is that the graphics look too cartoonish, but I love that style -- the models seem to come straight from a tabletop wargame! Despite being only a portion of the general opinion, this game for me is the best in the HOMM series, accompanied by the third one.

♥♥♥♥ you Ubisoft. So ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sad they discontinued the servers so people could do Co op Campaigns or multiplayer as the Factons they enjoy playing and tearing each other apart. This game is enjoyable as a heroes of Might and magic game. truely one of the best in the series next to the classic heroes of Might and Magic 3. The campaign is fun and challenging with a interesting story and lore. My only problem with this game is the fact that freaking Ubisoft being the greedy pieces of garbage they are shut the servers down and now you can no longer do matches where you vs other players or Play Coop. really? there's no other reason to buy this game anymore other then the campaign and even then forget about doing scenario's unless you want to fight against not too smart Bots. honestly sad they shut the servers down and even worse do to how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ubisoft handled this franchise we may never get another Good Heroes game unless people start making great and interesting spin offs. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sad, oh well games enjoyable but If can Buy heroes 3 off GOG or anywhere else I'd get that over this unless you want updated graphics and semi better gameplay..but you'll be doing it against bots and not actual players.. rip Maybe some day way in the future another great game inspired by this series will take flight till then Rip Heroes.

As a long time veteran of HMM, I can say this game is solid. The story is not as good as some before, but still OK. Somehow it feels a little less complex. On the other hand, the animations look nice enough and the maps are cool. The campaign is long and will take ya plenty hours to complete. Only a few missions are really hard in normal setting. No bugs. Nice music. Different camera views. Little heroes just doing their might and magic as they should and that's always a classic cool gaming experience.

Heroes of Might and Magic V, prersents as a classic high fantasy strategy game. Magic, swords and sorcery. Good graphics, excellent cueing. We play through a series of senarios, each presenting a challenge. These senarios also connect, telling a story. And surprise: sometimes you play the 'good' side. Sometimes, not. All in all, a delighful excursion. Still undecided? Watch some play throughs on you tube, etc.

I enjoyed my time with HMM V. You might as well.

Doesn't compare to HOMM 2 or 3, really this should be called just "Heros" as they add there own twist to the game. Is fun however! Music is good but nothing compared to the classics. Graphics are really good.

Still one of the best games in the series, including the expansions. It's the perfect choice to put it on a laptop and play here and there while on vacation :). I've used to play it years ago, keep playing it now, even after I've finished HMM VI quite some time ago and currently playing HMM VII.

If you have the chance get this game - it's a must for HMM fans and turn based strategies in general, especially when it comes on sale for 4-5 bugs.

FYI : Works perfectly on my Win10 PRO 64bit (considering the fact the game was released back in the 2006)

As a huge fan of the New World Computing's Might and Magic dungeon crawler series(especially 3-8) I never felt interested enough to play the heroes games. Now starting to find out how much i was missing. So, without any background from previous heroes games and more as a M&M fan, Heroes V is a great TBS that everybody should try! Great graphics, addicting gameplay and overall a nicely designed game in many different aspects. 8/10

I played Heroes III a while back and remembered loving it. I've made it almost all the way through the first set of campaigns in single user mode, and it's been a blast so far. The thing I like the most is that you've got to have a strategy. It's not so easy that you breeze through it. There is some challenge and possibility for failure. I could see losing hours and days of my life to this game.

I did manage to find an even BETTER deal, outside Steam; speccifically being a copy of it, with it's expansions included.
----
When I first played this game, I was dissapointed due to the fact that, when it came to some custom standalone scenarios, I couldn't choose a faction type, to play as. But then again, at least this game is definitely not terrible, and overall, doesn't quite have the glitches, that "Might & Magic: Heroes VI" does.
What makes it convincing is, this game combines the genres of turn-based strategy games with minor town development involved, (so in other words, games like Sega's "Total War" franchise, only with being fantasy-based) with tactical-rpg elements. Only thing is, only your leaders are able to level up, and NOT the recruited army members; they're simply being LED, by your leaders, that you get to play as. There are two types; "might", which focus more on strength, and "magic", which focuses more on spells that can be cast, to fight against your foes, but still being a bit more tricky, in some cases.
----
In other opinions, This game is quite interesting; as an in-depth strategy game, I first remember playing the original "Heroes of Might & Magic", as a used computer game bought from a thrift store, and I did play it, back when I was a younger child. It was pretty good, and overall, I LOVED IT; it definitely had some depth into strategy-based gameplay, even for it's time.
While the game definitely is not the greatest game on Steam, it's definitely a gem that not everyone knows about. I never cared for games outside the "Heroes" series, within the "Might & Magic" franchise.

Coming from HoMM 2 and 3 I must say I was surprised with this one.

I was quite well surprised because before I played V, I first played IV (4th) and that one just lacked everything for a HoMM game.

This one feels like it went more back to it's roots and the classical HoMM formula which makes it such a great game. The visuals are pleasing, the minions and leaders are also quite well made and it still has that "Just one more turn and I'll go to bed" in 4 in the morning to it.

Can't say I got that into the story of the game but then again I never have played the HoMM series for the story.

If you liked HoMM 2 & 3 I find it hard NOT to enjoy this gorgeous piece of Might and Magic.

Awesome game, a sequel which is truly in the spirit of Heroes 3 (this pretty much sums up everything to say about it).

The only problem with it it's that in huge maps with many AI players, a turn takes a lot of time (even on new machines) which can be become a annoying sometimes.

Overall, it's an awesome game.

Slightly camp turn based strategy. Has a plot twist that is telegraphed from practically the beginning but still a good game. Like all the HoMM games it can get a bit repetetive before the end and the last couple of levels can start to feel like a bit of a chore but I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap TBS.

The game is as good as the old one. The graphics are great, soundtrack is great. The only problem I have found is a glitch in the first campaign last level. I am not sure what triggers it, but the entire game will shut down. huge bummer. I hope they get it worked out. Really like it so far.

A game to rival HOMAM 3 itself. Without straying to far from the layout of HOMAM 3 this game has both upgraded graphics and funtions.
I would recommend this game for any HOMAM fan.
HOMAM 3 is still the best one ive played though ;)

Awesome game. I'd recommend to buy "Tribes Of The East" instead because it's the same game with more content. It doesn't change the fact that HOMM5 is a great game; it even makes more fun if you play Hot-Seat.
10/10

But seriously, buy Tribes Of The East if you want to play HOMM5!

Why has nobody ever told me about these games?! I just bought the M&M bundle a couple days ago and started with this game. I'd only every played Dark Messiah, and that was not at all what I expected (see my review). I thought Heroes was going to be similar to Warlords: Battlecry or Warcraft. I couldn't have been more wrong.

The only thing this game has in common with Warcraft is the fantasy setting Warcraft is an RTS; M&M is a turn-based wargame with RPG elements. You start the game with one hero, who has a small army attached to her (like twenty troops or something). You run your hero around the map, picking stuff up and claiming buildings for your team. When you get into a battle, you get whisked away to a battle board where you play out a strategic turn-based battle.

The controls are so intuitive that there are times I can't figure something out. Them I DO figure it out and I'm like "oh. I didn't think it could be that simple."

I can't wait to play M&M 6, and I can't wait to play the two expansion packs for this game.

My advice: remove your head for a few hours and play this game. It's very easy to play, and there is a decent tutorial.

I love the 3D towns and also the BGM for the towns. They just fit so well. I can just stare at the town screen forever. (With "town fly-by" setting turned on)

Amazingly fun, tons of flavor, best art style in the history of HoMM.
Music is fantastic!

I cannot say enough about HoMM 5.
The last TRULY GREAT HoMM game in the series.
After HoMM 5, heroes has been less than stellar.

Get the whole HoMM 5 saga and enjoy the 2nd best HoMM game in the franchise!

Beautiful graphics, excellent story line, great game play. If you like Turn based games I highly recommend this one. I do with there were better skill trees as it is a bit confusing at first especially trying to figure out what skills are worth getting and what they lead to. But I am only a few hours in. Also I wish the UI size could be changed. It is HUGE and rather ugly compared to the beauty of the game. LOVE LOVE LOVE the 3D moveable camera. I wish they had kept that in all their later games but alas for some reason they did not... perhaps in HOMM 7.

Get this game, You will not regret it and it is a heck of a deal.

The game is actually really great, not better than the previous Might and Magic games but it's really great, far way better than Might and Magic VI which is an okay game.
There's an average amount of factions (with expansions) but there are still some missing from the third one, I'm specifically talking about the third one because it's the one who has the most factions up to today but you do have some new factions, one that were supposed to be released as an expansion for the third one but did not.

If you love Might and Magic and turn-based strategy games then you'll love this game.
Its expansions are also really good.

8.2/10 worth the purchase

The Heroes of Might & Magic franchise has to be one of my top 5 series of games. It's a RTS with city building and intricate fighting battles. My favorite has always been that your heroes level up as they conquer land for you, making for that MMO feel we all love.

I came in with low expectations, thinking nothing could improve on Heroes 3. And I was partially right, because this isn't an improvement and that is a good thing. I encountered a bug wich prevented me from continuing the campaign, but I was already satisfied with the game by that point. So thumbs up.

Ok so basically it is amazing
Pretty good graphics
The gameplay is also amazing,and it is very long...I mean,you have to play to finish a mission for like 5-6 hours(for me at least)
But it's still an amazing oldschool game

The best HMM serial since HMM 2.

A classical version thought out every side, music update and the UI redesign, all region have it's own unique skill tree and hero skill tree, the variety in this game are HUGE, so this leave plent of replay value on it.

also this version is the frist well refine 3D model that have fine animation and creatures model, which is the ture advanvace since HMM2, the original art style in HMM2 are well refined and beatiful, which is frist HMM serial I meet in child.

there still leave some small flaw, like the camera angle sometime obstacle block the monster while battle making people confused, the AI casting spell are dumb and illogical, result waste tons of spell mp, quite annony since I use auto battle feature a lot.=

I had to rage quit this game.

A bug in the scripting caused an event to never load, so I had to go back and replay about 2 hours worth of progress. Then, on the first mission playing as the Demon Lord, after having to reload the map multiple times. This due to navigating myself into a corner while trying to flee two over powered pursuers, I finally made it to the end only to have the Boss Battle completely annihilate me on every play through. Seeing as I couldn't back track, due to an over powered pursuer being one turn behind me, I would have had to restart the whole mission again!! All the while playing on the easiest difficulty, mind you.

It's a fun game none the less. I just suck at it! It's also unforgiving of your time vs mistakes balance. I ain't got time to replay maps over and over.

This game is much better than 6 or 7 that followed it. The reason for the negative review is because it stopped working. Now every time i try to start the game, i see the first picture, then the resolution goes wonky, then a black screen that I have to restart the computer to get out of. I have tried contacting all the support options, but cannot get help. The internet searches always bring up how to fix a black screen on #6, with no reference to #5 in the first 5-10 pages. If the game starts working again, I would recommend it to anyone who likes this genre, its one of the best. Too bad its unplayable at the moment.

Great game, i own all of them and i like this one a lot i got it when it first came out and boy what a mess but now it seems well, if you want tons and tons like over 100 hours of Turn Based, character leveing, gear, buildings and a array oftroops look no further this game works great on my Win 7 x64, just fine. i also got the addons, you do not need to create account on uplay or anything i think that is just VI. give it a try but wait for a Sale like i always do.

Its a really fun game for playing with friend the only this that isnt that good is that you cant play from pcs you either have to be on one pc or through teamviewer but otherwise its a really cool game and i recommend it to anyone who can spend atleast 1-2+ hours everytime you play it.

MUST BUY 1000000%
I count more than 600hours befor buy it here in steam (cause i had it as original collector pack in my old pc) is the game that every one sould have and propobly the best of all Homm. Despite that is a bit of old game its worth every $ that you will give.
It can give you at least 50 hours of enjoyment as you follow the plot, its ethistic game (already finished it 3 times now i am going for the 4th)

Trust me and buy it
philipgreek APROVES 100% :D


tip:if you buy the game in missions dont wait too long to build a very strong army to fight with enemys beacause ememy is most likely to win :)

as the NYT once said "Addictive as Chips, but Less Fattening" - google it, read the review there ^^ the game & series obviously is well worth a few 000´s of hours.

It's an acceptable addition to the world of Heroes of Might and Magic. No where near as good as Heroes 2 or 3, but better then Heroes 4. The 3D graphics are decent, although i prefer the colorful sprites of Heroes 3. The story is new and you do not need to have played any of the other Heroes of Might and Magic games to follow it. If your new to the series, i would suggest you start with Heroes 3 before you play this.

I've been a fan of the series since the first one came out, and while this one is definitely different, it's very good. Like the others, you can get lost in the game for hours and hours. Heroes 3 is still the best in the series, but Heroes 5 isn't super far behind.

Take note: if you just want to do skirmishes/custom maps, skip this and by the Tribes of the East version of the game, which contains everything but the campaign from the base game and Hammers of Fate.

So far its fun, story a little cheese but I love zooming in and getting another perspective while travelling the lands with your hero. I'm a little upset that there's no map generator but I've read the expansions have it so I'm thinking of purchasing them.

So after the disaster that was Heroes of Might and Magic IV, they were all like "Damn. We should keep doing what we were doing before!" So they made a game that's like Heroes of Might and Magic III. Which is good. But because it's newer, they HAD to use bulky 3d graphics that waste space and emulate WoW. Cause that's what all the big boy fantasy games do. Of course, all that rendering and 3d map creation takes time, time that wasn't spent on actual content.

There are only about 15 different artifacts in the game. Only 6 factions. Spell selection has been cut down dramatically. Not as many skill sets as there used to be. There's only like, 4 or 5 heroes per faction. Maps are not nearly as big as they used to be, heroes can't move as far to give the illusion of space. There's barely ANY multiplayer and freeform maps, so you'll burn through them pretty quick. And another thing that irks me is that the little blrubsthat give you a small story on HOW you find artifacts and bonus sites and whatnot are gone, which isn't that big a deal really, but annoying none the less. And to top it all off, the music is bland and unmemorable, unlike the previous games. Oh, and all the sound effects for finding resources and interacting with the map are gone. That's annoying too.

And despite all of that, it's STILL better than Heroes of Might and Magic IV. But if you want a really good turn based fantasy strategy game, stick with Heroes of Might and Magic III. It's the same thing, except more.

I dunno. Maybe all the content is in the DLCs. I wish there was a "eeh." review button.

Bought this bundle along with part 7 that I got for like 10 bucks on another site. Played both and like this one alot better. I am gonna play this campaign along with all dlc first before moving on to 7 but I was surprised that this one felt better. Other than the graphics everything else is a step down in the newer version imo.

I bought this game because I used to play HOMM3 with my sister and thought it would be nice to try a newer version. We ended up being extremely disappointed as the servers are not working and there was no possible way to play together. A waste of money.

Homm 3 is still better. I loved that game and tried all of the sequels, but none of the upgrades improves upon Homm3.

This version adds 3d isometric, which is a pain in the ass. It does add deeper variation among creatures, which makes the game richer and more complex, but it doesn't make up for the suck factor of 3d iso.

Oldschool game. If you haven't played it when you were 8-13 years old, you will think this one is not worth the money. I love it because I have played this game soooo long ago and it brings me good memories and nostalgic feeling about it. All enviromoment reminds me of GOT or LOTR (In my perspective). V one is awesome because battles is a lot more improved than before in IV or III one. Also all of your army charackters has three levels not two (if you have bought gold edition) which is really cool. I would give it a strong 7/10.

The HoMM-series didn't get any better when it started being in 3D. It's actually the other way around. My advice: DON'T buy this title BUT buy HoMM3 HD or give Age of Wonders 3 a try instead.

I really Liked Heores of Might and Magic 2 and 3. Any of the games after that just lost appeal. I wish they could have expanded on the platform of 3 a little more. Heores V the map is awkward, and dashboard doesn't seem as smooth to navigate. Dissapointed.

It's a good game if they can make all 3 titles of HoMM5 in 1 and fix all bugs.
The price is fair enough although.

Heroes of Might & Magic V


Pros-


#1.Fun

#2.Cheap

#3.Tons of unit types





Cons-

#1.Graphics so old

#2.It can be buggy sometimes




The Bottom Line -


I still like this game and like the strategy style it has.

Get it for $3 or less on a sale or buy a key.

After quite a bit of of relatively fun play, I had to spend hours repeat level 6 multiple times, and I couldn't get past it even on easy difficulty. I kept getting stuck and killed. That was after having spent a couple hours on level 5 trying to figure out some extremely vague quests about finding something and meeting someone, but with little clue as to who, how, or where, and so eventually I had to look it up in a walkthrough.
For me, generally I play games to get away from the frustration in my life, not add to it. That's why I decided it wasn't worth headache to continue playing. Unfortunately I guess that means it will be impossible for me to experience the rest of the game.
I can never understand why some people seem to enjoy games that require hours of repetition and failure. In my opinion, the easy setting should be for people who don't like that sort of frustration.
In summary: frustrated and dissapointed are not emotions that I want to experience when I'm playing a game.

This is (for the most part) a proper successor to Heroes 3, which is generally thought of as THE best title in the HoMM series. I still prefer 3, but 5 is in many ways a recasting of Heroes 3 in a prettier skin. Mechanics remain largely the same, although I felt like the bigger maps were still a bit small. Enemy AI cheats too much, so it might be worth seeking out third party mods to see if anyone was ever able to address that. Regardless, this is a good buy if you can get everything on sale.

Game is awesome but there are missing characters & utilities. Normally you should have 2 choices for upgrading your character (ex. Lich -> Archlich or Sepulcher) but in this game you can only upgrade to Archlich. I am waiting for the new update. Hope they will fix it.

I start off by saying this game popped my cherry in the HoM&M series. This game has some features that should have been brought forward into the newer installment and the graphic are overall very well done for 2006. Not much else to say, I bought the newer game and can't even remember the story to this game, but I know I have not finished it yet. That being said I completely ruined the game by using cheats and rushing through, so don't do that to yourself.

Зайдя в игру вы увидите весьма не стандартное меню первым делом в глаза вам бросится арт заставка однако это сново облом и такого в игре не будет,однако вы можете затянуться в этот мир и не вылазать с него сутками.Зависимость у вас развиваться будет быстро,за то игра стоющая, но вот сюжет не затянул, тупая прокачка в стиле ММО не даст вам особых впечатлений.И то что нету русского языка конечно русификатор перекрывает это,однако русский тоже межнациональный язык,но разрабов это не интересует.Подсчитав всё что есть в этой игре и хорошее и плохое я понял одно играть стоит однако не за такую цену,если уж и брать то только по скидке,причём крупной. 6.5/10

It is a very unpolished game more so than a lot of early access titles. Super boring even on hard difficulty and with a story to match. If there is a good part, I didn’t have the patience to get that far.

It works on OS7 very smoothley!

Small con negative it is more fun to play with friends who live close to you, but still this game works great.
No other complains!

Buggy UI and AI.
My biggest gripe is the AI. It used to be fine, but now that my hero learned Deflect Missile (and taught it to all my other heroes), that's all they cast in battle. I will be battling against casters or just foot soldiers, and if left to his/her own, my heroes will just start uselessly defending against missiles!

UI is super buggy. Clicking is a little off on buttons but the worst is using sliders. For instance, using the marketplace to exchange resources REQUIRES using the slider. Most of the time the slider doesn't work. Sometimes as you grab and wiggle around it will jump the bar somewhere around where you wanted it. It is impossible to get it exactly where you want it, so after 20-30 seconds of trying to slide, you will choose a value that is "close enough". Same thing when you split your armies, the slider is terrible so it's easier to split army in half (default position of slider), do transfer, then continue splitting the result in half until you get the exact amount you wanted.

This is definitely a keyboard-only game. Most of the screentips show you which buttons to press, but there are still many that you can only figure out by trial/error. For instance, there is no way to split armies without using the keyboard, and there's no tooltip letting you know to hold shift and drag the army.

The only reason why I'm not changing my review is because I finally managed to finish the thing. I finished it because I'm a completionist, not because I actually enjoyed it. Having said that, it does have good points. It's just that this steam version seems fairly terrible in terms of difficulty, some levels will be extremely easy, while others very hard. And that's fine. But one or two levels in particular, you will almost certainly quit the game on.
Apart from that, I guess it's quite fun in its game play. The voice acting though is boring, you won't care about any of the characters, the animations of the characters are very stiff, and the story line is nothing special.
I'd give this then a 5/10. I still can't recommend it, unless you've got a lot of hours to burn up. It is not the worst game ever, it's just very poorly constructed. And it has quite a few bugs, too.

Played this game years ago, uninstalled after a mission bugged and wouldn't progress. Reinstalled this year, loaded up one of the single player large maps, spent two days playing it, and the game bugged and couldn't be finished.

Bravo. Just play HoMM3 and ignore the rest.

Limited skirmish mode forces you into an uninspiring campaign. The lack of ability to freely choose which faction you want to play as during skirmish hamstrings its fun.

I like the franchise, but this title is just not fun for me. This is the second time installing the game, hoping to get into it but I didn't enjoy it.

HoMM5 is very much a product of the mid 2000's with it's low poly models, muddy textures, cluttered UI, and clunky mechanics.

The game is still beautiful today, but is lacking is the gameplay department. The difficulty in this game is implemented trough a cheating AI, which produce armies from thin air. The story is cliche, almost bad, about some Dark Messiah. Another problem is the lack (small number) of custom scenario maps. Better stick to Heroes 3 or maybe 4 (blasphemy).

Well, I read in some reviews, that guys say, that they played Heroes 3-7 and this is the best game in all of them. Are you serious??

Compared to Heroes 3:
* The graphics is appalling
* Combat is much worse, including rectangular plots instead of hexes
* Also strange turn order in combat which is worse
* Story is a placeholder

Actually, I didn't find anything, that is better, or even on par. Playing Heroes 3 is a beautiful, thrilling and thoughtful experience. And this feels like a garage-level try buy.

Wow, how utterly disappointing. Was a huge fan of Heroes 1,2 and to some degree Heroes 3. Somewhere after version 3, this game series lost it's way. This is a type of game that can do without all the "3D" crap because it's about strategy, not how garish and inflated the graphics are. Mindless animations laying over the top of impeded gameplay make for an extremely frustrating experience. I mean, trees in the landscape should not obscure items that would be clear to the heroes. The adventure map is meant to look like... a map! The designers have just over done the heck out of this game, so much that it's totally lost the spirit and overall feel of it's predecessors. To add to this, there are actually no significant improvements in the game just COMPLICATIONS. Dress up the graphics a bit of course but always remember to keep the game mechanics simple, playable and fun! All I'm getting from this game drawn out frustration! I could write a list a few pages long on improvements to this POS.

My first HoMM game and I really enjoy it.
I had played my first Kings Bounty game today as well - KB Legend
Not sure how I missed these two game series over the years.
They are a refreshing change and FUN.

I just finished the game after playing it for the first time this weekend.
And loved the game so much I bought the Hammers of Fate expansion as well as HoMM VI and also started playing HoMM Online as well.

Way back in 2002 I had purchased what I believe was HoMM IV, my first HoMM game and I recall within minutes not liking it, deleting it and for the next 13 years avoiding all HoMM titles.

GEEEEEEZZZZZ, what was I thinking!?!
On a whim, I played Kings Bounty for the first time last Friday, "KB: Legend"...I loved it !
And also was happy to find out that HoMM and KB are related.
This got me thinking to give HoMM a 2nd chance, so I bought HoMM V and OMG I love it!
I could not stop playing it!

Although, I finished it, I still have Hammer of Fate to play.

I would say to anyone on the fence, that if you have never played a HoMM game before but are interested, give HoMM V a try.
Keep in mind the graphics are older, but are good enough to enjoy as they are still 3Dish.

Or, you can try Kings Bounty first as a test and if you like that game you will like HoMM V as well.
Either way, the two games are so inexpensive that its worth it.

I loved HoMM V so much I just bought HoMM VI as well and am playing Heroes Online as well.
I do not understand the mixed reviews other than the UPlay issues that are forced on you with those games.

Happily HoMM V does not have that issue.

Unfortunately (and I mean it), I cannot recommend this game for the simple reason that it is too GD grind-ey.

This game is nothing but eternal grinding, and although I understand the appeal of a perpetual Easter egg hunt, where one is immediately rewarded with little Easter eggs - each level takes so long it is simply downright punishing.

I pretty much got halfway through the game, and I looked ahead with dread at the amount of effort to complete it and I simply would rather spend my time doing something else.

I said "unfortunately" because I wanted to like this game, understand the appeal, and played it with a hope for a welcome distraction because I work a high-stress job where I make impactful decisions all day, and I usually seek out games like Majesty 2 or even the Total War series where I do not have to intensely devote myself to a game to play well.

I agree with the descriptions and reviews which indicate this game does have this - and it does...at least initially; however, as the game grinds on, and the levels enlarge, the same dynamics which existed in the first level persist to larger, and larger levels, so, like a car manufacturer enlarging a model of vehicle so that it weighs significantly more than the first year model, but retaining the same engine throughout, you are left puttering along with a small, 4-cylinder engine in an Excursion sized game.

For instance, the engaging challenges come early in each level, but as the levels grow, the same level-up scheme and cap exists, so that a main character reaches a certain level in an individual level, and can advance no further.

Thus, the player is left with a choice, continue with this character with no lasting benefit other than "winning" the level, or forging ahead with a new character recruited from a tavern...however, this new character does not carry over to other levels!
Thus, like artifacts for any character, any experience or gains made with this character are lost, and the player's only goal then is to beat the level as soon as possible with as little effort as possible because there are no longer any rewards.
Thus, the fun is drained away from finding Easter eggs, and instead they become an annoying hinderance to be bypassed at every possibility.

Fine, but then, as I reached pretty much the exact mid-point of the game, and I had reached this annoying, unrewarding point, when I had figured out the level to the point where I had an insanely overpowered army, with multitudes of the most expensive, most powerful units, where ANY enemy I encountered was - again! - was just an annoying hinderance to be avoided because I knew the inevitable outcome, that I grew despondent and weary of the idea of completing the superfulous tasks necessary simply to finish and carry on to the next level pretty much to start again with nothing, I knew I would never finish the game.

Once I have an invincible army, with more resources I could ever spend accumulating through no additional effort, and the AI algorithim can only generate weak armies simply to create "something" on the map after I handily defeated their most powerful ones earlier, I asked myself what is the point?
For a game to continue being engaging for a player once they reach the inevitable OP moment when they have mastered the game, it is upon the game to either end that stage soon thereafter - or to organically increase the challenge, so the player uses those skills learned and earned to attempt to defeat the new challenges.

This game simply fails to do so, and confronts the player with only the same challenges, but "bigger" like someone speaking slower and louder to in a foreign language to make themselves understood.

Too long, too repetitive, overall too boring. A pity, because actually the story had some potential. I have finished the first two campaigns and right now I really can't bring myself to start another one... I would recommend it only on a really good sale and for the hardcore fans of the series.

Awful if you were a fan of the previous Heroes of Might and Magic especially number 4this game might not sit well with you. not very much content. Graphics are great, small hotseat maps very limited strongholds gear heroes. All in all a faint shadow of the previous which is unfortunate because the graphics are good.

Just remake Heroes III and make it run on modern systems and everyone will be happy.

The fancy 3D-model stuff ruined the series and now it's a joke. The artwork in Heroes III was perfect. But now we must have rotating cameras in the city for added dizziness and disorientation to the player, and also this messy world map that can be rotated. SIMPLE IS BETTER, PEOPLE! I will not buy another HOMM title until they go back to simplicity. A simple, elegant art style with a balanced gameplay like Heroes III.

Don't get me wrong, HOMM 5 is not the worst in the series. Gameplay-wise, it sort of improved on the broken predecessor. But they went all fancy with the town themes and art style. So the game PLAYS well in terms of balance and strategy, but feels silly and you can't take it serious because the 3D models have this stupid exaggerated style and the town themes are dumb. It's not a world you feel like you want to daydream into when you play like it was with Heroes III.

Obsidian went back to roots with "Pillars of Eternity" by returning to a SIMPLE, ELEGANT and FUNCTIONAL graphics style, and the game was a success. The same needs to be done with the Heroes series. A new sequel is releasing now, what, is it 7 or 8? I stopped keeping track after 6 because it's ruined now.

60 hours on steam, my whole life on non steam CD from 2005.
Pros:
-Amazing story
-Fun yet hard campaign
-Hotseat so you can still play with your mates or against CPU
-Scenarios
-Great OST
Cons:
-Animations are rather bad even for a 2005 game,tho the expansions fix it.
-There are still bugs,I had to restart the campaign because of one.

I love this game, but the only options for purchase are: the base game, or Heroes 3-5 with all of the expansions. I don't want spend 60 dollars on games this old. I would pay another 10 for the rest of this one. Hint Hint Ubisoft. As is, I would only recommend getting this on steam if you want all three games.

Remembering how much I love Heroes of Might and Magic games, I thought this would be a sweet bargain but this is complete ass. It is worse than any heroes game I can remember. It's ugly, it plays like a hot mess and I can't imagine what kind of person would play this over any other heroes game, or any other game in their library for that matter.

It's a fair HMM episode and was great in its own time but can't recommend it these days really. My main problem is it does not handle 16:9 monitor properly, you get the picture stretched out horisontally. Pretty lame really. So get Tribes unless you're stuck with a really old monitor with 4:3 or 5:4 ratio.

Old but Gold. If you like turn based strategy and a world of fantasy, you will like this game. There is multiple factions with a variety of creatures to recruit, train, and fight for rival cities on the map. You choose a hero to play as, and each hero has there own unique perks and special abilities that enable you to get bonuses in combat.

As a fan of Heroes IV, I had high hopes for Heroes V. Unfortunately, I quickly became bored after just 30 minutes. The voice acting is subpar, the music is lacking compared to IV, and the combat is boring. The flavor text from IV (like when you pick up an item or visit a shrine) appear to have been removed (to be fair, it could have appeared later) I just found the game underwhelming as a whole.

Boring campaign with a childish story, and uninteresting dialog. The graphics in this game were cartoonish and remind me of Warcraft 3 and Final Fantasy, which diminished my enjoyment of the game. The soundtrack isn't as good as earlier HoMM editions either.

Skip this and play Heroes of Might & Magic 2 or Heroes of Might & Magic 3 instead. While not perfect, they are much better.

I got to a part of the game in the 3rd campaign where a cutscene *starts* to play before immediately booting you to a game over screen. I reloaded, same thing. I decided that was it, after poking at the game since 2009 that I was done.

This game has some charm and nods to folks that grew up alongside the HoMM series but it feels like a chore.

I installed this on my Windows 10 PC and it was too buggy to play. Would not save games, for one thing. Also, empty dialogue boxes and crashes. I probably would've persisted with it otherwise, though a lot of the graphics were unimpressive.

1 - Great
2 - Great
3 - Great
4 - Great. Using the hero in battle took some gettings used to, but was awesome.
5 - Crap. Ruined a perfectly good concept of a game by trying to make it into something it's not.
The graphics are very anoying, which I don't understand because IV looked awesome.
I really did try to play the game, I forced myself to sit down for few hours but it was boring as hell.

I've loved all the Heroes of might and magic games until this one came out.

Regardless of these minor concerns, HoMM V is a shining example of how a turn-based strategy should be executed, and will no doubt set the standard for generations of the genre to come.

Pluses and minuses. The series is deteriorating. Devs keep cloning it, disregarding fans, and making the game actually worse.

Bought this game, didn't like the graphics nor the gameplay. Couldn't manage to get a game going with 3 players, always one not being able to connect through ubi.com. Only positive thing is that only 2,5 euro down the drain. 1/10 Toasters.

massive massive disappointment.

multiplayer does NOT work.

why do i need to go through massive loops to make it work?

activision blizzard has such simple online gaming made - why can't ubisoft do the same and make multiplayer easy and possible without having to install this, uninstall that, disable this in your router, turn this off?

THE ONLY company I EVER have trouble playing online with.

EVERY SINGLE other game works when playing online.

Tell you something?

bye ubisoft you lost a loyal fan.

if you can't even get multiplayer to work, what's the point of playing your games?

Can’t recommend it. Ugly graphics but still the fans run hot on my computer and it’s almost 10 years old. Seems like a bad optimization. The AI is either OP or ♥♥♥♥♥♥, there is no between. Some interesting skills but not balanced. The elves’ ranger ability just works for 1-3 creatures, so how often an encounter with them happens is too hard to predict. It was almost just boring to play. Not close to Homm 3.

Моё любимое^_^ ещё с 3-ей части "Heroes of Might & Magic" я полюбил эту серию. Мало где ещё можно встретить игру подобного жанра, хороший сюжет, интересный мультиплеер, да и "Игра на одном компьютере" тоже очень классно реализована. Жду продолжения, вечной жизни всей серии этой игры!

I'd played one of the earlier versions years ago. This version seems to add nothing new but slightly more realistic graphics, but those same graphics tend to make it hard to see things due to angles. I found the game to be tedious and never got through the tutorial campaign, which takes forever.

There's one simple reason why this game should be avoided. It is impossible to protect your rear line by slowing / blocking the enemy with unit placement. This game uses a square grid system but allows diagonal melee attacks and movement. It also doesn't have any penalties for moving past an enemy unit. These combined make the tactical combat a joke and eliminate any tactics whatsoever. Your ranged units will always be prioritized and attacked by melee units with impunity.

I've played a good share of similar games including HOMM3 and Kings Bounty. It's a general problem that ruins all games of this type when allowed. Other games that I can't remember off-hand do it right and make unit placement actually mean something. Not this.

Update 2014: A note to the steam community: Don't downrate this review because you disagree with it - that's not what the system is for. This is a well written review that points out important strengths and flaws in this game.

Update 2015: 27% approval rate, BAH - this is why steam reviews section is littered by garbage! I criticized it as a poor choice as an entry game of the series - for new players. I still think this review is good and the mechanics will be no less puzzling for anyone else than me. There are very few guides and none in English on steam at the time of writing and there's no good tutorial for explaining how to really compete within the game. Oh well - enjoy your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviews then Steam community. :P

Heroes of Might and Magic has always been a puzzling franchise to me and the fifth game in the series is no exception. Heroes of Might and Magic V is a turn based game that goes into a turn based (very turn based) combat system when you meet enemies in similar fashion to the Total War series.

Presentation
A turn based battle system would be an entirely acceptable thing except that the game has so many variables and numbers that trying to get into it is endlessly confusing. In addition to that we have the fact that the "armies" are represented by mere numbers and a single unit model. It does seem like the game could have supported far more models on screen but sadly the user interface hinders you from having more than 7 stacks of units on field, this makes the game's presentation of allowing you to command vast armies seem very dishonest to me. It's always fun to stack numbers up but a game has far more potential for visual presentation that the game truly takes advantage of.

What really strikes me with the game is it's fantasy. The basic game of Heroes of Might and Magic offers 6 different factions: Haven (Humans), Sylvian (Elves), Dungeon (Dark Elves), Necropolis (Undead), Inferno (Demons) and my favorite Academy (Wizards)! All of these factions feature classic mythological and fantasy creatures and gives them stats to reflect their strength. Every race is relatively well balanced as well I would say, at least for first appearance. Every single race has 7 available unit types and each of them can be upgraded once (or twice of you got one of the expansions). Haven's units starts off with the lowly peasants and end with bloody angels, in-between they have a sweet mix of medieval flavored units. How these armies are built up are pure genius and there seem to be little to no redundancy in the units neither.

I also need to praise the city screen with looks glorious and the upgrades to it is amazing eye-candy.

Gameplay
I cannot keep praising the game much longer though. I have a real problem with some of it's gameplay mechanics. First off is the unit growth system. In order to get together an army the player must build special buildings for each type. You even need to upgrade these buildings in order to upgrade your troops. Fair enough. However, there's a serious flaw that your units numbers don't grow without the buildings. So potentially another player could end up with far more units than another, and there's no way as far as I'm aware to even such a setback out, short off trying to win a battle early on. It seems to be then that unless you get a perfect start a game isn't truly worth playing to the end.

The heroes do have magic powers that could be used in an attempt to even the odds between the players but these spells mostly cannot be learned (at least not over 2nd circle of spells) without the respective skills in the magic field. This becomes problematic due to the fact that these skills are awarded to heroes at seemingly random. In addition to that the magic spells are also rewarded at random in different Mages' Guilds in different cities. Due to these facts it seems like the game is controlled solely by luck of the draw and little of good skills. In battle the randomness seems to take far less importance, instead the amount of randomness is mostly determined by creature characteristics.

The RPG elements in the game seems to amount solely to stacking stats. A hero with plenty of artifacts and a large army seems to be a force of nature and entirely unstoppable. There seem to be no apparent penalty for having large armies like having logistics problems or slow progress, instead large armies travel with the same ease as small armies, making taking on more powerful opponents very tricky and seemingly impossible.

Conclusion
There's a lot to admire in Heroes of Might and Magic V. You might have noticed that I like using uncertain words like "seem" a lot and that's because I have only played this game for approx. 15 hours yet and I'm still figuring out the quirks of the game. This pretty astonishing to me really as I've been annoyed at several core things in this bloody game and I still keep playing it for some reason. I guess it's extremely addicting and it shows giant amounts of potential. I still think that the greatest flaw as far as I'm concerned is it's presentation. There's never any real big army feel and as time goes on you, as a player only end up to feel more vulnerable. Don't think I haven't searched for any gameplay guides for this game, there isn't any! There's no good documentation either and pretty lousy "tutorials" and it shows that this game was made mainly for the fans of Might and Magic and few others.

The gameplay in itself is bad enough and due to the lack of being able to even out unbalances during the game's progress and the dishonest presentation doesn't help either - but in the other hand the game is also very addicting, has great potential and the fantasy aethetics are gripping. Sadly because it's so hard to play this game for anyone new to the series I have to refrain from recommending this game.

The game is great, but is too hard. I select "Easy" difficulty in campaign, I finished first one but in second campaign I just can't complete fourth mission. I tried it many times, still difficult. When I select "easy" it is supposed to be easy I think. I've played all previous Heroes games and didn't have that problem. Sorry, but I can't reccomend it because of that.

Would you like throw away your money and get nothing for it? Well here's the game for you!
This f@#%*&^ game never started, but it did run in the background of my pc for hours (voiding Steam's return policy) requiring a restart to close the "game".
F@#% THIS GAME! Avoid unless your a masochist.

Gameplay: fun. Writing and plot? absolutely terrible, to the point of being nearly offensive. Their characters and motivations make no sense, and their main female character is some jilted lover's perception of what motivates that weird other sex.

So first of all... this game feels incomplete. There is so little content for a HoMM game. Especially compared to the last three. Secondly, maybe it would explain in the campaign but is there any reason none of the characters from past HoMM games showed up? (Even Sandro who pretty much is the MAIN ANTAGONIST of this series!) As well as culture for teams completely swapping also. (When did Wizards become Egyption??)

I'm normally the last person to complain about graphics but these graphics have aged so poorly. The faces look super serious but the bodies look like a Chibi! How is it a game made 10 years before this and was a cartoonish styled graphics managed to hold the feel of the series much more than this?

There are just so many bad things in this game that overshadow good ideas. I like the idea of your Hero helping in the battle. And I like the idea of choosing between normal abilities or combat abilities. But the castles... Hoo boy the castles.

So firstly the castle menu is very unfriendly. Remember how in every other Heroes game before the castle was a very simple set up? Press a building and you can see all the things you can build. Right click on them to see prerequirements. Very friendly. Here it BLOCKS OFF buildings you can build later! If you can't build it now then you don't see what you need to build it. But I suppose it's useless anyway since Prerequirements have been removed really! You need to build a certain amount of buildings to "Level up" your town hall in order to build later buildings! Making strange combinations and unique building mechanics for teams like in the OTHER games impossible to pull off! The only good thing that came from the new castle is it showing the resources it will subtract from your stockpile right next to each other. That's actually very nice.

And don't get me started on the overworld. You feel squished. Remember how in all the other HoMM games all the info was put on the right side of the screen making your map space feel normal as well as giving you all the info in one spot? I guess Ubisoft decided it was too cool for this and tried to put the info ALL AROUND YOUR SCREEN. Moving around the map feels claustrophobic. This game is just not fun. Play any of the 3DO versions instead. They will be much more rewarding.

This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and let me elaborate why; Maps - ??? where the ♥♥♥♥ did they go. You only get a few maps that you can play custom games on. HOWEVER, on a lot of these maps you're forced to play a pre-determined faction.

Runs like ♥♥♥♥ on anything past windows xp/vista if you're even able to get it to start.

Graphic glitches galore! Weird colours and blurry textures.

People who worship this game are either very young or they have no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ taste whatsoever. You shouldn't be allowed to play pc-games.


Play these games instead: HoMM 2, HoMM 3, HoMM 4, King's Bounty, Fallen Enchantress.

If you disagree with this review you're a moron, sorry.

First impression: When people write that this is the best HOMM game because of their memories, then they are completely blinded by nostalgia and their reviews can be entirely disregarded.

I've played Heroes of Might and Magic since Heroes 3, and I can't say I got enough of it. It's an old game by today's standards but the story line is nice (it does have plot holes and it's cheesy sometimes, but can't have it all), game play is well developed with lots of upgrades to choose from. Characters are humorous as times (Raelag, Zehir and Tieru are some of my faves, Isabel not so much - too linear). A drawback is that your heroes levels up at 40, which is not so fun sometimes. Another drawback is that the AI adversary cheats when playing on normal something fierce :). It looks good (drawing wise) and the soundtrack is lovely (I like listening to it outside the game too). I love the turn base play style as it lets me think through my moves (kind of like chess, but with the option to save and redo).

not the most up to date graphics (it did come out in late 2000's) but between the steam and hard-disc versions, ive put well over 200 hours into it

All of the best features of Heroes III transformed into 3D and expanded in both features and spirit. This is my favorite version of the HoMM franchise so far, it's almost perfect.

Graphics are pretty dated (and not in a fun, intentionally throwback kinda way), but this was the last entry in the HoMM franchise that was fun to play, Not bad as a nostalgia purchase at the $9.99 price point.

I've played this game on and off for around ten years and I always come back to it because it really is just that good. Each faction feels unique, well-balanced, and fun to play with. Admittedly, for me the campaign was a little to difficult and at times depended heavily on grinding, but overall this is a fantastic game that has high replay value!

Still the best version from HOMM 3D series.

The only problem is you need to pass thought campaigns consistently one by one and you can not decide from which race start your journey. It's solvable with the help of cheatcodes, but slightly frustrating.

This is just an all around great strategy game. It's old and that shows in the graphics and design, but the gameplay shines through all that and is as fun as ever. You can run this on basically any computer made after 2007 (that's the oldest I have ha) which might seem like a dumb reason to play, but hey sometimes life happens and you may still want to play a decent game without having a gaming computer.

The game itself is divided between tactical turn based battles where you move your army around a grid, assign attacks, etc as you would in basically any tactical RPG (Fire Emblem, FF tactics, etc) and a larger strategic map with control points/positions that give benefits to your armies. The strategic map is where you build your armies, expand your cities/settlements, and move your hero(es) (who is/are leading an army) around to start battles and capture control points. The strategic map is also turn based so you're never under a lot of pressure to think fast. If this is confusing, watch a video on the first campaign or something similar and it should be pretty clear what the gameplay loop is.

I remember buying this a few years ago and being a bit skeptical, never was a MM fan really since it was a bit before my time, but this is a fantastic game and I'm glad to have stumbled across it. Highly recommended.

I first player the H5 Series back in the primary school. The game it self and its expansion provided me with an amazing experience, both the campaigns and other maps. I always play the single player version, so I don't really mind if the multiplayer server is shot down.

Be me:
have nostalgia for the game you use to play with your dad and find it here
What luck!
play for 10 hours deep into the dead of night
finish the first campaign
"I'll play the next one tomorrow."
go back to menu screen, exit to desktop
shut your laptop down and go to bed
*next day*
have breakfast and boot up the game to start the next campaign
not able to select it
go into the first one and see it sent me back to mission one
"surely if i load a save and complete the mission it will send me to the next campaign"
it doesn't
feel sadness and be upset.

finally, took a long time to beat the campaign. Beat it on hard difficulty and its hard enough, I wonder what heroic difficulty would be.

Story is interesting, lot of twist, some of map unnecessarily big and boring but overall I enjoy it a lot.

This was one of my favorite games to play in high school with my friends. I have never played the actual story, yet. I'm going to though!

This review is simply to promote giving it a shot with your friends. It's a great strategy game and I love the graphics for the time it was made. Mechanics can be a little wonky, but otherwise it's beautiful.

There's a few different modes you can try out. Including building your army, exploring, resource collecting, leveling, and conquering.

Got stuck on one of the later missions, the first of the Ranger series (The Refugees). I've played this mission four times. I finally looked up advice after the third time to learn that loading the file for this mission sometimes bugs it so that the event that needs to happen to end the mission (holding the boarder) just doesn't. Maybe I'm picky, and it is an older game, so bugs happen, but it feels game-breaking.

If I knew that the mission concluding incident would *definitely* happen, maybe it would be more worth my time, but again, as an older game, or maybe just because it's turn-based strategy, there's a lot of what feels like down time? Traveling to and fro and not getting much done because traveling takes a while, even with the skills that make you go faster. I usually play games until I'm so sleepy that I just can't, but I've actually found the game tedious at times, allowing me to go do something else with my life.

Most of the reason I'm playing this game in the first place is for nostalgia. This franchise (I think 3 and 4?) were the only video games we had for a long time that weren't card games or board games of some sort, and I loved the creatures and the art, still do. I do appreciate that, though it's age shows in the bugs, the art and the voice acting are actually rather good. I love the little details that went into the critter creation and some of the character creation. I am going to be looking up a video of the ending just for closure and to make sure the antagonist gets what's coming to them. At the same time I bought this one, I also bought Heroes 7, so I'll be switching to that, and I'm hopeful for the same nostalgia and critter creation with fewer bugs.

Bonus points: When I was playing Heroes as a kid, I think it was 7 that we bought but that was too fancy for our dinky old computer to run without crashing or lagging. X'D

Good pickup, just less intuitive than Heroes 3. I like the story of this one and got a little more immersed but the gameplay was a little lacking compared to 3. I still will load of HMM3 and play maps on it. This I haven't played since the first few campaign levels. 7/10.

if you like the Might and Magic franchise, here is another game from that franchise. There are new campaigns with the same general game mechanics. In addition they have added animations to the combat. Personally I see this addition as superfluous, but some might like the change. For those of you who do not care for these type of games, this edition to the franchise will not change your mind.

what i like from this series is, the maps are considered not to complex, so you can enjoy playing custom games and campaigns without spending to much time in one map. The older graphic quality ensure today's machine play it smothly without any problems.

Buggy sh*t and waste of money. Every 3rd/4th campaign scenario has some critical bug in it blocking you from finishing the entire scenario. You have to google it, see the conditions for preventing the bug and restart the scenario, praying it won't happen again.

Good luck and have fun with it.

Solid strategy game with a decent story and long campaign, as well as interesting characters/ races and creatures, though the dialogue bit cringe. In my opinion HOMM5 style and graphics way better looking than HOMM7. Sadly online is down but still playable with your friends if using local.
If you are interested in strategy games with good campaigns then HOMM5 games are definitely a good choice and HOMM5 Hammers of Fate and Tribes of the East are improving the game even more.

I played this years ago but never finished the game. Have been playing it now and even though the graphics are a bit dated, it is still very acceptable and the story line is well done.
Really like that you can play with all kinds of heroes and built their strengths so you are not stuck with one type of armies.

A great addition to the Might and Magic franchise. The variety in skill trees between kingdoms had me planning out builds. Seeing the order of attack for creatures at the bottom really changed my strategy. Easy to jump into and a lot of fun. Highly recommend.

Childhood game for me and it's great don't get me wrong but in terms of recommendation don't buy it since the game got stuck on the first mission. seen some people had similar issues so consider that before buying the game.

If you've played any of the might and magic games before, you should know that this is probably the best one. 3 is good, but outdated and only has one playable faction, which gets boring. VI is pretty but the story leaves something to be desired, and VII is probably what you started on if you're newer to the series. The graphics are outdated, but the gameplay and story are very good. highly recommend to both the seasoned HOMM player and the new one.

A great game! Aged pretty well design-wise in my opinion even though 3d doesn't hold up as well. I love the shapes and colors and great vis dev overall for the game. Still enjoy playing it after I re-discovered it on steam, very nostalgic. Love the lore for 5-8, however prefer HOMMV over everything that came after it for actual playing experience. 11/10 Would recommend even for new players who don't shy away from slightly outdated graphics. Has a soundtrack to die for too.

The Heroes of Might and Magic saga is one of true lore, game play experience and enjoyment! I personally have spent hours on the campaign alone. Online is more difficult, as the game is a strategy command-and-conquer style makes it hard to sit down with friends and play together, but, if you need a game to play on your own, are looking for a good place to plan on how best to defeat your enemies, then this is the game for you!

I think I have bought this title on three separate occasions. I would say it's my second favorite after HoMM 3. The change to a square grid and adding diagonal movement was not my favorite, but the combat works well with the way units were designed. Large units now take up four tiles instead of two. Heroes and units have an action in an initiative queue, and it allows for some amazing planning and combos with the new skills system.

There are primary and secondary skills in HoMM 5. The primary skills will be familiar from other games in the franchise, but now you get to choose specialties within them. These specialties are race specific. In HoMM3 you could bring a stack of demons back from any slain allied unit with an ability on Pit Fiends. In HoMM 5 the leaders for the infernal faction can have their stacks summon additional demons to aid in battle. By ranking up you can have higher tier units summon and get special bonuses for your summoned reinforcements.

Town development and resources are straight forward, and the factions feel right to me. There is a lot to do, and the campaigns are fun. For the current price this title is probably worth it if you like other titles in the series.

Just completed the campaign for this game on normal mode.
Pros :
- Longevity (took me 60 hrs to complete campaign)
- Accessibility (not overly complicated, playable at any age, good albeit lengthy tutorial)
- Undemanding (can be comfortably played on a laptop)
- Customizable (different factions, skilltrees, etc)
- Save whenever (outside of combat)

Cons :
- Steam release has a difficulty bug on one campaign mission (had to use a specific strategy to complete the mission)
- Slow gameplay (definitely change your settings to speed up movement and combat)
- Gameplay loop (battles become stale quickly at lower difficulties)

Verdict :
Buy on sale. For 3$ it's a good deal and a fun low effort game that will last you a while.

Game completed twice.
Many of you may say that Heroes III is the best one ever made.
I have to disagree.
Heroes V is best for me, because of it's gameplay, graphics and simplicity.
Even if you have never played game like this, it won't be hard for you to find yourself and manage "how it works", because this game is easy to operate.
Everything is clear and understandable.
Story is also addictive.
The only thing I am not a big fan are dialogues in cutscenes, just because they sound pretty weird in english language.

I just love this game. Since my childhood.
The music is great, I like the lore here, and the battle system is (was) new for me.
The only thing I don't understand is... localization.
I do not really care if i play on English, but HOMM V *HAS* Russian localization, and I know it well since... I'm Russian :D
It just bugs me, because I sometimes want to hear it in Russian, but Steam just refused to add it. Does it make any sence? Not to me, at any case.
But nevertheless, the game is good, and I recommend it to all who loves strategies ^-^

A very solid strategy game in its own right and solid entry in the series. It no longer has multiplayer support but the single player is nice so Its not missed. I haven't played for a while so I can't say how well it will run on windows 10 but I know it ran pretty well on windows 8 when I played it last. Solid game give a try and at 10 can't lose.

i may be a little biased couse it was my first game ever but its fun semi tactical turnbased gameplay and feels a little like chess set in a high fantasy setting its fun and has lots of replay value. doing the multiplayer hot seat ageinst the pc is a bucketload of fun and with a lot of maps to choose from its an overall good game

there is alot of story, quests, magic artifacts to search for and handle. witch creates somewhat of a talasman ish vibe. really fun, really engrossing.

Nival took big risks in rebooting Heroes of Might & Magic story because it destroyed its legacy, not to spoke the change from hexagonal to square tiles and the cheese acting of the characters. Yet the result is actually a great game on its own and the fact that today is still more played than its two sequels speak on its own. I think what was a good idea was rejecting the realism of HoMM 3 & 4 and going back to HoMM 2 sillyness, with its shiny graphics filled with colors and clear shapes: you could change everything to black and white and still clearly recognize most of buildings and units. Everything is stereotypes, which is good. I have particularly fond memories of the map where the Warlock has to capture 7 castles on his own: such a complex quest that can seem hopeless but with order and discipline it can be done and the challenge is so good that the reward is a memory that will bring to peace and hapiness forever. Thanks Nival.

To start this off, the game is alright. Better than I expected to be honest. This is one of my first introductions into a turn based game other than XCOM where base building and exploration is implemented.

If you're willing to try something completely new, like I did, then the game is worth it. The game has a lot of game mechanics that work of one another and it was fairly enjoyable to learn and improve in the game. There are some old game rough spots that could turn you off from the game, but I think you could manage to work through them

My biggest complaint of the game is oddly enough that it's uncomfortably long. 6 campaigns, each of which is about 5 chapter long and each chapter roughly taking me about an hour or two to finish most of the time, but then out of nowhere there is a chapter that could take you a day to complete due to just being a tedious level, or failing at the end because of a sudden difficulty spike. And I would say that happens in each campaign. There are some events that make this worse, like travelling from to land to sea which takes up an entire turn which makes it even more tedious or your hero just having a low step count and you being in a large map. There are some skills that fix this, but I didn't know the importance of these skills so the majority of the game is me skipping days to get my steps up again

The games story is lacklustre due to you being thrown in the deep end and not knowing what the world is about and the game not doing the best of jobs to engage you to actually want to stay and see what happens. I finished the game, but was quite disappointed how it all turned out in the end. I can't remember anything story related after the third campaign

The most memorable part of the game and the soul reason I would recommend this game is fractions and their interesting features and mechanics, the progression of your faction in a game mode and the combat encounters which can be turned in your favour. Except the demons who were the least interesting of the bunch. The game is very dumb fantasy ie. Stereotypical fantasy powers. There are unique factions that require a totally different playstyle.
For example the Mages being very defensive and flinging magic spells left and right and the Undead who focus on resurrecting fallen units to fight over and over again giving this seemingly endless supply of units.

I only played one of the two standalone dlc's and that was Tribes of The East. If you're considering buying just one of the three games, Tribes of The East is the one to go. It has all the factions and all the features of the base game and the second dlc and more.

At the end of the day I would rate this game a 6/10. An above average game where you can experience a lot of fun, indulge yourself with an old game like style that seems alien today, devoid of any microtransactions that ruin the game.

ps. The game had some trouble with being played on a 1920 x 1080 resolution on my friend's pc even with his high end graphics card. So I would recommend you check out a a guide on how to prevent that if you're considering to buy this game.

I used to play this game when I was a kid, and decided to buy it since I had time to kill due to the pandemic. No regrets, as fun as I remembered it to be! The single player campaign is challenging enough, yet not to the point of being frustrating. The hot-seat multiplayer option is good too, with lots of different scenarios to choose from. Great way to waste time

My first HOMM was number 6 in the series and I really enjoyed it (with player patches). I sunk 600+ hours into that game and I just started 5 recently. I must say, HOMM 5 holds up so well! The game is addicting and fun for someone that never played it "back in the day". If you like a great tactics turn based RPG, this is definitely worth your money.

I love the Heroes of Might & Magic games! Hadn't played HoM&M5 in years but just dusted it off since I have some extra time on my hands thanks to being locked-down due of this stupid coronavirus :( Guess I'll do my part (stay home, social-distancing) and play video games :D

If anyone needs help with any of the HoM&M games check out CelestialHeavens.com and Maps4Heroes.com, both have walkthroughs, forums, etc.

Great game. Much like HoM3, though skill trees based on the original skills have been added and heroes are given a more active part in battle and their own turn. Over all well done. Similiar enough to previous versions that it's not completely different, but enough changes to make it stand out. HoM3 still might be my favorite, but the jury's not in yet.

Played this game on my dad's computer since I was about 10. I've always loved it. Great story, great graphics for the time, and the strategic combat is awesome. Definitely recommend for anyone who loves turn based combat fantasy games.

Absolutely the best strategy game of all time, no contest. Great upgrade system full of intertwining skills, although not explained in-game, there is a website that shows the net of combining skills. Great races/towns to choose from, great creatures, amazing campaign that is extremely hard on any kind of difficulty, almost impossible on the Heroic difficulty, creative story and an extremely high number of variations in the game consisting of, but not limited to - artifacts, spells, skills, even unique kind of weeks that come every 7 turns that turn the events, basically You'll have a lot of fun with this game and You'll be challenged a lot. One con though - it takes a lot of time to learn so be ready to devote a big chunk of time to it.

As archaic as it may seem, Heroes is a simple yet effective turn based strategy game.
Playing this game now incites just as much joy as it did for me over a decade ago.
The simple yet effective variants of different races with they're own play style and specialist units makes the player think of different strategies for each respective army.
Fun and simplicity personified.

I've played Heroes of Might and Magic since the very first game. To me, it's like chess on steroids with the vast amount of strategies at your disposal. 2 and 3 were phenomenal as well, but 4 fell flat. 5 picks up where 3 left off, however, with the polished gameplay expected from the series combined with a larger scope. I really love these games' campaign modes because they are truly challenging (when I play a random map solo, I'm usually meek and timid, taking my sweet time, but the campaigns force you to act decisively). Check this game out if you want some good old turn based fun!

This is one of my favorite games of my childhood. Even though it is quite old I'd say it is a good aged game. It is also suprisingly stable, it didn't crash once. All in all a really good strategy game and sadly the last good one of it's series.

I played Heroes of Might & Magic III nearly a decade ago and am disappointed with the format of Heroes of Might & Magic V. The game play has significantly changed and it's more scenario/ quest based as compared to the previous format where you could have your own method of winning/playing. Thus when you have completed the scenario/ quest, it becomes no longer fun to play.

Personally I like it more than HOMM3, the story takes a while to get going but the maps are challenging and fun. It's a lot of fun and I used to play it as a kid all the time, looks great, has great music, and is balanced in a HOMM sort of way, where the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ strategies are still there, but everyone gets them so it feels just right.

Does not have the best graphics but the gameplay makes up for it.

Almost as good as Heroes 3. Lots of replay value, you can try different strategies and heroes. Pretty much balanced, does not have OP homm 3 stategies like diplomacy, using armageddon spell with magic immune troops and cloak of the undead king with expert necromancy. War machines are kind of OP, especially ballista with Vittorio and Deleb. But all factions are useful and equally able to win a match. Enemy AI sometimes kind of stupid, for example they make their melee units run into moats when attacking your town when you put a small unit at the end of a moat. Also could use more maps and map editor.

Very good game. The campaign will keep strategy game lovers on their toes or if you want you can just play a multi-player against the PC or local friends if you don't want to be restricted on the campaign rules. It's a shame they closed the servers but its not surprising as the game already have a few years since release date. Look forward to play the next instalments.

I'll mostly write this review for newcomers to the series, as veterans probably already have a strong opinion about this game vs the other homm titles. For reference, this is my 2nd favorite heroes of might and magic game, after homm4.

This game is a turn by turn strategy classic, where you win games though map control, simple town/economy/units management, and chess like turn combat with the armies you built. There's a big focus on hero characters and their skill tree.

The world and plot can be somewhat cool if you're an heroic fantasy fan, but for a lot of people it'll be pretty barebones and cliché, other Homm games were way more interesting in that aspect. That being said, sometimes it's so nice to induldge in unapologetic knights vs demons fantasy, this is my 1982 conan if you will.

The gameplay is simple to pick up, but there's a lot of room for difficulty and minmaxing games.

Building up your towns in this game is the best experience out of any homm games to me, the 3d town screen is just a gem. The core gameplay is maybe not as polished as Homm3, but the presentation is the best to this day (Homm6 doesn't look that bad, the towns are so much worst though, and generaly the designs aren't as inspired to me).

The 3D might look a bit dated theses days, but the world design has honestly so much charm, combined with Paul Anthony Romero's god tier music. I don't think it's only nostalgy talking there, there's a lot of good art in this game.

I think this is the most accessible and fun Homm games for newcomers.

Nostalgia brought me here more than the game itself. Would like to see more maps.

IMHO this is the best in the series (or at least the best among 2, 3 and 5) and those were outstanding games.This is turn-based Strategy RPG gold: with exploration, a tons of items for your heroes, tons of races, tons of skills, tons of units. I play the game at 800x600, the low resolution after I experience some craches. Some people have twaked it to play at higher resolution and Windows 10. I didn't bother. I think it is fine with the low resolution. Game is polished. Perhaps what stands out in this version is the long cool campaing. It is hard at times but you can adjust the difficulty level and of course there are the cheats (ehem). There are cutscenes driving the storyline and clear goals. I appreciate the open ended part of the game (it has of course skirmisher mode and several stand alone scenarios) but I like storylines and this game delivers it.

If you like any other game in the series or similar games (Disciples, king's bounty) you will like this.

Custom game creation is a little weird to me, but otherwise a very neat continuation of the series. Worth a look for Heroes fans.

Fun game. Play it in classic view or it's complete garbage. In classic view, it's great! Not as great a game overall as Heroes III was, but still fun and a good play for a fan of the series. Also, I got a random, really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful glitch out of nowhere. Red character trails showing everything I clicked on that built and build and built until the game just couldn't handle it anymore, idk. It crashed H A R D and took a lot of clever workarounds to even task manager open because just closing the taskbar icon did ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cause the screen was already black and I guess it was asking me "do you really want to quit?". Except I couldn't see that message or click on it, so the black screen remmnants of the game basically held my laptop hostage. Wouldn't even let me alt tab or alt f4 or open task manager. Eventually, I was able to trick it into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by presing a button on my keyboard that allows me to switch layouts instantly (if multiple screens were connected) and I just switched rom "2 screens" and back to single layout. This finally allowed me to mostly access the desktop and save some work, but still left 1/4 of the screen, the top left corner, covered in the black screen. This so happened to also be covering the window for task manager. So I grabbed chrome and dragged it to the left side of my screen which activated the windows 10 thing that has you chose another window to pair next to it. Chosing task manager, It gloriously appeared on the right side of my screen. Finally, with the game's music growing glitchier and glitchier in the background, I was able to end the task.

1/1,000,000 bug: still a great game. I plan on getting the expansions once I finish the campaigns on the main game :)

Great game, the linear storyline is fun but leaves a bit to be desired. That is just a preference of mine though. The story quest is nice and long and it gives many parts of the same story which is always an enjoyment.

Great game, didn't run into any bugs.

It's well worth it for the price you pay, but some things I didn't like:
-No random map creator, has an option for user campaign but I haven't found a way to make one,
-Campaigns are fun but short, and only a limited amount of scenario maps.

Other than that I recommend getting it. Reminds me of Heroes 3.

Great game, really fun. Each playable race feels unique. I've sunk about 70+ hours into it and still feel like I have a lot to discover.

My one complaint is with a specific mission of the capaign. Specifically, the 3rd campaign mission for the Mages, called the "Triumvirate." It seems to have been changed on the Steam version versus non-steam version, and is now unbeatable? I tried for hours and hours at this mission but no matter what I did, the enemy AI always rolled over me with an ungodly amount of troops. After watching playthroughs and reading walkthroughs (all based on the non-steam version), I am forced to conclude this problem only exists in the Steam version of the game. The difficulty of this 1 mission is so insanely higher than any other mission in the campaign, even on Easy. As it stands, the campaign seems unbeatable because of this bugged? mission. If anyone has beaten the campaign on Steam, please tell me how you beat this mission?

Otherwise a really enjoyable and colorful game that I'd definitely recommend!

TL/DR: Love the gameplay, the bacground lore, and the graphics... The campaign's writing isn't as good though.


- - - - - - - - -

I loved Heroes 2 and Heroes 3. I didn't hate Heroes 4, but I didn't enjoy it as much as 2 and 3. Heroes 5 was a title that I loved as much as I did 3, and played a good amount of it and Hammers of Fate from the Amazon download years ago - just now repurchasing it on Steam.

It made some little new features like not needing to micromanage critter dwellings with throwaway heroes just to secure the critters which vanish at the end of a week, now they stockpile so you can come back to hire them in bulk whenever you need to. HoF added Caravans so you don't even need to go out to them anymore!

The additional skills and subskills I enjoyed quite a bit, allowing even further customization of heroes and has always been fun for me to play with. Many of the creature re-designs I enjoyed quite a bit, especially the Archangels and Wraiths. Since Heroes 5 is set in a different universe than Heroes 4 and earlier, the background lore is quite different, but I enjoyed reading about it and quickly grew to like it.

The game only ships with a small number of scenarios, compared to Heroes 3 and 4 which had a large number of them, so I guess they were going for a Quality over Quantity approach. Coupled with the lack of a Random Map Generator, this means that the base Heroes 5 has a somewhat lower replay value after you've played the scenarios and finished the campaign, at least compared to HoF which brought the RMG back.


Speaking of the Campaign. The Campaign was fun to play, though a few maps were a touch tedious and/or frustrating. Then there's the story itself...


Isabel: Even if there’s 99.9% chance that Nicolai will return as a mindless minion of the undead, isn’t that 0.01% chance that he’ll be my loving, caring husband enough to justify the atrocities we’ve committed?

Godric: No.


Love it or hate it, the campaign story was a bit silly at times. Really now Isabel, you're that quick to trust a necromancer?
This snipet from 'Heroes in a Nutshell' is a good indication as to how odd some of the characters decide to behave in the story. At times it was funny, but overall I didn't really find myself caring for it much. The background lore is pretty great, but the writing for the campaign was somewhat less so. Adjusted a bit it could be a fairly good story though.

If you want to hear a silly retake of the story, you can head over to Heroes 5 in a Nutshell and read the overview there. It's a tongue-in-cheek take on the story but doesn't really leave much out either.

I've been playing heroes 3 for +10 years now on and off, and I"m so glad I treated myself to heroes 5.

I find them quite similar (except heroes 5 looks better). I like it just as much as heroes 3, and it's great you can automatically set it up so you don't need to battle every monster in your way.
I also like that you can change the camera angle and that your hero will also attack during a fight.

I haven't played that much yet, but I'm looking forward to playing this regularly!

A must have for anyone who enjoys strategy RPGs

This whole series is required reading in my classroom. It has it's flaws, as any older game would, like how some missions can drag on, due to some monsters being scripted to fight you, regardless of how overwhelming your advantage is, but if you can get over that, you'll find days and days and days of enjoyment in the campaigns.

Slightly improved Ui over the previous installments, and a fun new ultimate skill unique to each clast (though they did balance that a little poorly, since by time you have the required levels and skills to get your ultimate, the campaign will be mostly over, if you can get it at all).

I woukd also strongly suggest getting both the DLCs for this, as they both include new campaigns that are just as long as the main game.

If you like Turn Based strategy games or were a fan of the might & magic games when you were younger this is the one to buy! has the gameplay you remember soo fondly and no bugs or problems ive found in my 200+ hours of gameplay.

This is one of the games i would add to library to play with a friend or a couple friends, online can be super fun and has some of the larger maps you will find in this kind of game.

At the price its worth it to pick this up for you & a couple friends. thats what i did and will not come to regret it any time soon.

Hours of good, solid entertainment.
I have played through the entire game twice on normal and hard settings. Played using two totally different styles, cautious and then agressive. Aggressive on hard being more challenging of course. What I am getting at is that the game is enjoyable enough to play it through more than one time.
Graphics are excellent for the time it was made, but does not disappoint today either. I would strongly recommend giving Homm5 a chance. It is most certainly worth a look.
I also would strongly recommend purchasing as a packing with the DLC. you end up saving a good deal that way.

Brilliant game! I remember when I was 5 years olds and a first played this game on a real disk copy... good times. Three days ago I just went back to playing this, but I saw it was on one of the first versions, and I couldn't update it. So I bought it here for 2.5 dollars. (Thanks steam! :D)

ANYWAY! This ultimate game of roleplaying and fantasy has amazed me for years, and for me, will always be the best Might and Magic game in the series. Thank you for all the good times Ubisoft, I owe you. :)

Campaigns are casaal and easy going.
Combat is turn based, but quick enough to feel like
Real Time Strategy.

Campaigns are long enough to be worth the money IMO.

(Not sure yet if play past the campaigns if any good; still undecided,
but even the first 2 of 5 user campaigns are a good value even without
the other stuff IMO.)

Simply one of the greatest games I've ever played. 11/10 would get by butt kicked in multiplayer again. Totes worth the 10 bucks, and the expansions are pretty good too.

An epic game of my childhood. One of the games that has triggered my love for gaming and Strategy games.
Incredible fun and just overall awesome.
Recommend it to anyone who likes Turn-based Strategy, RPG, Fantasy world.
Though you may wanna lay off of it, if old-school graphics bother you too much.

Windows 8 : Works like a charm just by clicking play on steam interface (no tinkering required).
FYI same with Hammer of Fate & Tribes of the East.

Great classic franchise, V is the best iteration of the series with III.
Expansions add depth, game mechanics adjustments and boost overall (already gignormous) replay value.

Great visuals (by olivier Ledroit, none the less), great musics, great fun solo / hotseat / mp.

Just don't clic 'one more turn' when you gotta go and you're golden :)

Annoying animations, slow pace, confusing upgrade tree and if you don't know exactly where you are meant to go and when some maps become impossible before you figour out what you're actually meant to be doing.

Heroes 4 is better in every single way then this pile of rubbish (ok, other than not being on steam).

Heroes of Might & Magic V is one of those first video games that I remember begging for for christmas and actually got. And the reason why I begged was because I was playing it at a friends house in one of those situations where you and your friends mom are like ticking time bombs with no visible clock, never knowing when they are gonna stop ticking and make you leave. So we went up and started playing some duels in this game which I started to love it because of the close up shots of the battles which in my early tween ages, thought it was the coolest thing ever. However when I got it I immediatly started playing the campain and after a couple missions I thought "This is boring" And moved onto the ever so better multiplayer/scenario mode. This made me feel like a boss building up a huge army full of ents and blade dancers and useless fairies. That was until I realized the other army moving into my territory and thought "Oh crap" As I moved my mouse over their army and the words "About as much chance as having that seinior girl say yes when you ask her to the prom you puny freshman." Well after that I yelled at my computer screen that "I don't want to relive my freshmen year computer" And started playing with someone else. Which led me to another point, the point where the game is like monopoly, as there is no winner unless someone puts the game away, and they you are all winners.
However, like monopoly the game is fun for the few moments where you trick yourself into thinking 'I can finish' at the beggening. So if you like extrodanarily tactical games and monopoly, take this game and go play it with any friends you can find. The more the merrier. And the longer it is till your turn again.

This is an incredible game and I highly recommend it for anyone into the TBS genre of game. The biggest issue I have with this game concerns the campaign. Currently, the first mission of the Sylan campaign appears to be unbeatable through honest means. Ive looked at numerous guides and all of them agree that in previous patches, the mission was completely beatable and also unbeatable for various reasons, including scripting events that never happen. Currently, the player is left resource barren to protect a number of points that are supposed to be able to hold their own from an attack that occurs in the first week. Whats actually happening is that the player has little resources to hold off attacks that dont occur until the third or fourth week, and when the attack happens, the player is completely incapable of holding off these attacks.

Tl;dr the campaign is playable until the fifth chapter at which point its currently unbeatable by honest means.

If someone knows something I dont, maybe they can walk me through this mission.

Storyline to follow is nice and it indulged my nostalgia for the old version I used to play on the PS2. Easy going game that's not going to tax your skills much. Good for those times when you need a mental break, but does have some puzzel-like aspects.

This game is the fantasy version of civilization. Well, ok, so the only thing in common w/ civ is that Heroes of might and magic 5 is a turn based strategy game. Heroes 2 was one of my first great pc gaming experiences. This is that same experience, but with a nice 3d make over. I love this game, and I'm down to rule the land w/ anyone, anytime I have the time.

If you loved Heroes III this is as close as it gets. Apart from actually playing Heroes III. There are some nice city/kingdom management improvements but the game is mostly more of the same we know and love.

It's like they took Heroes IV and threw it totally out the window. That's probably at least a part of why this game is awesome.
From a gameplay perspective, this game is pretty close to Heroes III, with some new game mechanics like activated abilities for creatures and a total overhaul of the hero level system.
The graphics are starting to show their age a little bit, but the creature and terrain design are the bright and colourful, over-the-top fantasy fare that you would expect from the Heroes franchise.
Highly recommended for fans of either the oldschool Heroes of Might and Magic series, or of the King's Bounty franchise. Turn-based strategy/RPG at its finest.

If you like chess, this is your kind of game. It's very similiar, strategic, you can only move for so many paces in a certain amount of time, then it's your enemy's turn. While very different from the third HoMM, this game still has a lot of the same old flavour, making it still an entertaining game. Although I would probably say purchase if on sale.

I was a fan of HoMM since a buddy burned me a copy of HoMM:III in college. This iteration does not disappoint. Full 3D graphics, unique races, and kick ass tactical combat set in a turn based fantasy world. The nostalgia is so strong I'm almost welling up with tears. They don't make many games like this anymore; I'm glad Ubisoft kept this series going.

Heroes of Might and Magic V is a fun and rewarding game. Visually it is akin to the Warcraft series with it's slightly cartoonish looking environment but that may just be me who sees it that way. Gameplay wise it is much like the Disciples series in that it is a turn based strategy where heroes take the field and move around the map while other units in the army are unseen until a battle occurs. Towns and resources must be captured to produce additional units which is a must as you will loose units along the way. Here again there is a similarity to the Disciples series where town building is on it's own screen and you must choose what to build this turn, unlike Disciples each building only takes a single turn to build and every seven turns (the beginning of a new week) there will be new units to recruit. Fans of the Disciples games will feel right at home with Heroes of Might and Magic V and if you enjoy Strategy games I recommend you give this one a try.

This is the only game in this series that I have played, but from my limited perspective I think this is probably the one that provides the biggest bang for the buck (and holds up perfectly well today, due to a unique and colorful aesthetic). The game provides a decently deep strategic experience that can get quite addicting after awhile, but also a bit repetitive. Regardless, I would definitely say it is a compelling game.

If you do pick this one up, be sure to find the custom hero graphics on the internet. It really adds a lot to the game for each character to look unique in the skirmish mode (which is really the mode you should be playing, all in all). Also, be sure to pick up the two expansion packs, too.

HoMM V is a great game. The story is pretty good, the graphics are nice to look at. The strategy is solid and interesting. I particularly enjoy the castle building and unit upgrading features and I really like that you can recruit units of other races into your army. This game is fun!

Great iteration of the turn based strategy game in the fantasy genre, 3D graphics during battles are a nice touch, more challenging story campaign than some of the previous Heroes games though may make it daunting for those without a good bit of time to dedicate to each map.
