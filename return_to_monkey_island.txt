Fair warning: I have played the original two when they were new, and Curse of the Monkey Island is in my top 3 all time favorite games through a span of ~30 years as a gamer, so I'm somewhat biased towards the series.

This game had a rough runup, mainly how everybody was whining about the art style. But if you look at Monkey Island, the first two were pixel graphic, 3 a hand-animated masterpiece, 4 a wonky 3D iteration, and then 1&2 were remade in a smooth reimagining of the originals, so there IS NO DEFINITIVE graphic style, only the one you have in your mind's eye, depending on which episode you boarded the train.
That said, R2MI is a little different from what you've grown accustomed to up to this point, but same as with every game: graphics are just but a fraction of what makes a game worth playing, and Monkey Island was always more for lore, crude humour, wits, subtle pop-cultural references, inside jokes, a very unique atmosphere, recurring characters, and slapstick.
If you're new to the series, and just ended up here from the Steam recommendations page: do yourself a favor, and play the first 3 games first, because (after the graphic overhaul), they not only hold up to this day, but they are, and will eternally be a part of gaming history. If you're done with them come back, and then play R2MI because it will feel.. well natural at that point.

Now about R2MI: It's everything I wanted from this game. Sure, it FEELS a little different yet again, but all the hallmarks of a great game are right there.
The atmosphere.
The music.
Dominic Armato's voice.
MURRAY.
Now I just began, but boy, does it live up to my expectations.

Arr, an 'appy Toalk lyke a pirate dae 2022, mateys.

Mac user here. The game is great so far. Just wanted to say that it's not a universal binary but an Intel one. That said, I didn't have any issue running it on my M1.

HTH. Cheers.

Remember the way Monkey Island 2 ended? That weird mess that confused the hell outta everybody? Well, the first 15 minutes of this game manage to "save" it completely and suddenly, it all makes sense.

And this is just one reason (out of many, many reasons I will experience as I play this game, I believe) you owe it to yourself to play RtMI.
Thank you, Ron!

EDIT: 3+ hours in and I love it! The music is there, the humor is there, and it's the perfect combination of nostalgia and fresh. The puzzles so far are fun and the inclusion of a hint book as an inventory item that never gets in your way is rather clever. Oh, and I love the trivia book! Really tests your knowledge of the series!

You can clearly tell that this game is a labor of love. And the art style - love it or hate it - simply works when you see it in motion.

EDIT 2: Have a drink whenever someone mentions "The Secret of Monkey Island". Now there's an idea for a party game that will get everyone drunk! :D

All good so far.

Great graphics and sound.

Good to finally find out the meaning of the end of 2.

Only minor oddity if that escape does not bring up the menu for some reason.

*Received a free early copy for coverage*

Return to Monkey Island is a very enjoyable adventure that isn't too caught up in the nostalgia or call backs to previous games, but rather wants to focus on the story here and now. Sure, familiar faces and locations return; however, the game never lingers on these as "'member this" moments.

The writing is as witty as ever, just don't expect to be bursting out in laughter, or crying over some sentimental moment. (There is a special Director's Cut you can access from the main menu that adds even more dialogue) The characters don't exist to tug at your heart strings, but rather to create lasting memories. Every character is memorable, from the way they act and their dialogue, to the way they look.

Andddd that brings us to the graphics... The Discourse would have you believe that someone's head should be on a pike for the art style, but it isn't bad at all. In fact, it is really nice. Yes it is a more minimalistic look and it isn't as nostalgic or iconic as some of the previous entries, but again this game isn't bothered with the nostalgia. This new art style lends itself very well to the environments, especially indoor spaces. LeChuck's Cabin and the Voodoo Shop are standouts for the way the art style creates motion and adds a surreal tiltedness (I'm not sure how else to describe it) effect. The characters are different, but still nice in their own ways. (Shoutout to Stan's jacket) Again the previous detail is lost, but the modern coat of paint isn't too shabby.

One bit of nostalgia that I didn't particularly like was the puzzle design. Now, only a few puzzles (on Hard mode), gave me the ole' Monkey Island nostalgia of being stumped, just like when I was a kid. Luckily, early on you are given a hint book that is incredibly useful and appreciated. The hint book lists all of your main/side objectives and you can ask for a hint for any of them. But the first hint will only be a general statement to gently steer you in the right direction. Asking for a second and third hint on the same subject will give more specific details. Eventually, as you continue to ask the hint book about the same subject, it will just tell you what to do. So you can never truly get stuck here.

A couple other appreciated quality of life features are the To Do List and Highlight ability. Guybrush always carries a To Do List, which you can view at anytime. This lists all objectives and crosses them off along the way. The game even includes a handy indicator that pops up above your inventory every time a new entry is made in your To Do List. The Highlight feature allows you to hold TAB at anytime to highlight all interactable items in an environment. This is especially useful for tracking down the collectible trivia cards, which are tiny and often blend into the background.

No spoilers here, so I'll keep this brief. The story is straightforward, return to Monkey Island (imagine that) and finally uncover the secret, but the road is full of twists. As Guybrush, you'll need to use your wits, some luck, and your endless inventory to overcome the challenges you'll face. Along the way friends become enemies, double-crossings galore, and plenty of limes to fight off scurvy (just no science!). The premise is simple, its the shenanigan's along the way that really matter and may even have you wanting more by the time the end rolls around.

With a runtime of 8-10 hours, although this can be completed in under 2 once you know what to do, Return to Monkey Island is an easy recommendation to fans of the series and the point-and-click genre. I doubt this will make any top ten games of the year lists; however, it is definitely an honorable mention as one of the standouts so far this year. Hats off to Terrible Toybox and everybody who brought this beloved series back to life!

Its the Monkey Island we all know. I don't care what people say about the art style, get over it.
The Nostalgia I have as a 90's kid playing these games hyped me for this game and it hasn't disappointed. The puzzles are just as crazy and the conversations are just as witty. Guybrush is back!
If your a fan of the series this a must!

[I'm at Part 2 as of writing this review]

🟢 The new artstyle grew on me when you have the combined ambience of the music, sfx and voice acting. It looks much better in-game than the screenshots or videos pre-launch.
🟢 Fantastic soundtrack by the legendary trio; Michael Land, Peter McConnell, Clint Bajakian.
🟢 A really nice Monkey Island-esque script and most of the voice acting is great. Dominic Armato, Alexandra Boyd, Denny Delk, Neil Ross and Leilani Jones all return as Guybrush, Elaine, Murray, Wally and the Voodoo Lady. The new LeChuck might be a slight let down but could've been worse for sure, it would be nigh impossible to live up to Earl Boen's previous work.
🟢 A total of 100 fun MI trivia cards cleverly hidden in the backgrounds, pick them up and they go into your trivia book in your inventory, check it out and you get a question about the series and a choice of four answers.
🟢 A nice little scrapbook on the main manu where you can read up on Guybrush's past adventures. It's not overly lenghty but a nice little touch for new and old players to reminisce about old times.
🟢 So far no overly convoluted puzzles, exploration and trial and error in solving them is great and RTMI has a nice pace and flow to it.
🟢 You can [attempt to] pet Scruffles, Lechuck's(?) cat.

🔴 Nothing major but world interactions are a bit simple, you only have two actions controlled by your mouse "Pick up" and a sort of universal "Look at, interact with, and everything else depending on the situation" which are tied to the left or right mouse buttons. For example at the top of the Lookout on Mêlée Island you get the written option to right click to warm your hands when you hover over it but it'd be nice if we tried that ourselves by text verbs (too old-school?) or a menu like CMI. It'd be nice to have Guybrush say something funny if you used let's say "Pick up giant glowing moon in the sky" but you can't you only get the option to look at the moon in RTMI. Then again it's still fun and doesn't take away any of the puzzle solving.

Yes it is a new art style...so what? You dont play Monkey Island for the art dude..you play for dialogues..you play for being a swashbuckling loser pirate..you play because every single minute of it takes you back to your childhood and makes you happy and reminiscant...so, by all means..screw the graphic and be happy that after all those years this is one of the happiest moments or your gaming life

Return to Monkey Island is absolutely tremendous. A lovingly crafted homage to the communal joy of experiencing these terrific stories. I laughed a bunch, and in the end I cried. It took me around 9 hours to complete and I played on "hard" and used the tip book a few times to keep the story moving. As a lifelong series fan I couldn't be happier. They nailed it.

I have been waiting for this game for 30 years and it definitely delivers. It's fresh, it's funny, it's thoughtful, and it's a true Monkey Island game combining the best from the original two, with excellent voice acting and elements of the following episodes.

I have bought a copy for me and one for my brother and I will keep gifting it to my old friends. I used to play the original ones with my mother, now I can't wait to play this with my daughter.

I cannot believe they messed up the ending again.
Art style is ok; 22€ for about 9 hours of gameplay.
Voice acting is superior.
The puzzles are relatively lame compared the the predecessors.

The ending leaves a bad impression so I cannot recommend the game right now.

Yeah I am crying. You know, things have been pretty rotten these past years, with the world going mad and all, then the plague. To be honest, while excited, when I heard they were makin another game, with the old crew, I didn't think that they would capture the magic of the games that I grew up with.
Man I don't remember the time that I was so happy for being so wrong
A masterpiece.
Did I mention I'm crying?

Woe on ye, poor non-pre-orderer, for you must play the game without the resplendent horse armour, the most glorious inventory item to ever grace Guybrush's inexplicably spacious inventory space! While the game will feel barren and lifeless without it, I'm sure, you can bask in the glory of horse armour DLC that only this review can provide you, now!

Pointless item aside, loving the game so far. The art style, while apparently controversial, looks really great. That being said, if you don't like it, what you see in the previews is what you get; there's no other option. So go with your heart/eyes/brain/whatever on that one.

As for the story, and Guybrush talking, so far it just feels like a Monkey Island game, through and through. It's good to be back.

It is Next-Gen Monkey Island. I can only say this game is amazing work from these Developers, and:
"Thank you so much for pulling me back to that golden era of Point'n'Click adventure games."
This nostalgic trip took 10'ish hours to play true, and it was definitely all worth it. It shows brightly true, this game is made for Monkey Fans. I really hope this game was not meant to be Developers way to say goodbye, because there is really high potential to continue this journey, and I really want to see how this continue, even if it takes that next 20 years waiting again.

This game is everything that a child of the point and click adventure games of the 90s could ever want. It’s nostalgic and it’s fresh and new all at the same time. Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman, and the entire crew have succeeded in creating the only thing that would bring an old gamer out of retirement. Kudos to the team! It’s a really great game all around, and I hope it reignites the genre.

Return to Monkey Island is an amazing game with a confusing ending. This will probably sound controversial, since it is in line with the meta-commentary nature of the franchise, but in the end even though the writers obviously had interesting and introspective ideas the execution falls flat. I would not say the conclusion comes out of nowhere, but with all the elements that kept getting built up throughout the story - especially those concerning the value of knowledge and the lengths people would go to fulfill their curiosity - it was sad that the story was simply and abruptly cut off. It just felt like there was more to be said and although the game tries to present its value as whole as whatever the player chooses it to be the writers obviously had a couple of more philosophical ideas in mind that just weren't fully explored.

Still, the journey there is extremely satisfying and worth the price tag if you enjoy puzzle games. I personally actually liked the art direction. The humor was very enjoyable. I finished it in about 6 hours on hard mode, but for people who like to take every dialog option and explore extremely thoroughly it will probably take 7-8 (not considering that there is a director's cut option that adds even more written content). I experienced one bug throughout my playtime which was the game crashing in the final chapter, but there is a pretty reliable autosave system so it wasn't really a setback at all.

A solid 8/10 overall.

Return to Monkey Island is pure joy, and no one can convince me the art style isn't fantastic. This game feels like catching up with an old friend only to find out that life has just been great to them over the years.

The humor, writing, and puzzles are among the series' best so far. The game is packed with little quality of life improvements that simply improve the gameplay without detracting from what makes the Monkey island formula fun and challenging, like the addition of a dialogue log so you can re-read something you may have missed or accidentally skipped over.

HOW TO UNLOCK HIGHER FPS / FRAMERATE

For those who have high refresh rate monitor, here are steps to achieve high framerate:

1. Go to this folder: C:\Users\(your username)\AppData\Roaming\Terrible Toybox\Return to Monkey Island
** Please note that "AppData" folder may not be visible if your Windows is set to hide hidden items. If that's the case, please choose to 'show hidden items' in the folders toolbar/taskbar.
2. Look for a file called "Prefs.json".
3. Open this file using a notepad.
4. Add this line at the bottom:

targetFrameRate: 120

5. You may change the number to your desired target framerate, according to your monitor's capability. The default is 60. You can set to 90, 120, 144, 180, 200, 240, whichever your heart desires.
6. Click File > Save.
7. Start your game and enjoy your new super buttery smooth Monkey Island!

Cheers!

p/s on a side note, here is an ultrawide fix for those with 3440x1440 21:9 ultrawide monitor (credit goes to Rose who made the fix):

Like many others i played MI1&2 back in the 90`s and I got really attached to it over the years. When the game was announced I was super excited and I read about all the criticism of the graphic style so I was kind of worried how it turns out. Now, I played the game for a couple of hours and its just marvelous. The mood it projects is just taking me back to 90s, but this is not a product of the past. There are so many references to the old game but at the same time you can feel its developing into something new. The balance between that nostalic feeling of the old games and the new elements is masterfully fine-tuned. So yes, this game exceeds my expectations. Barvo.

(I hope the Soundtrack will be released soon)

From the writing, to the music, to the voice acting - it's everything and more I hoped a sequel would be.

How it plays and controls is very well thought out, as others have said - play the other games first then this as it follows in a series. But absolutely play this.

So far so very very good! Spent 50 minutes in the prologue and the very first scene of Act 1.

Music is spot on, voices are a welcome return and without using 16 bit graphics, the characters are just as open to interpretation with a simple modern look - as the original characters were.

From the very opening onwards, this feels an authentic lucasarts point and click adventure of the highest calibre!

Only negative so far is the use of a "checklist" , which pretty much spells out steps for puzzle solutions - but it is optional (you don't have to open it in the inventory).

13 when I first played this, on the Amiga 500 - 45 today and got the feels all over again!

The Curse of Monkey Island is still my favorite game in the series by far (incidentally, not designed by Ron Gilbert), but this one is amazing nonetheless.

My only beef so far is the controls: why do I need a keyboard? A lot of things are tied to that device in the game. First of all, a modern mouse can have more than two buttons, and it would have been nice to be able to remap every single keyboard action to a separate mouse button. Second, even with a two-button mouse, it would have been possible to assign dialogue skipping, at least, to that.

Otherwise, I am missing the control wheel of the Curse of Monkey Island (borrowed from Full Throttle).

This is so good. It's actually perfection. Playing it feels like taking a warm bath on a beach on an island paradise. If you loved the original Monkey Island, this is exactly what you have been waiting for all these years.

I'm three hours in and *loving it*. It's smart, beautiful (particularly in motion—the trailers did NOT do it justice), *funny*, and compelling. I can't wait to see where it goes. What an achievement so far.

Haven't played much but I instantly loved the interface, extremely responsive dialog system, overall voice over, music and sound design. I really hope this will inspire other game companies to invest in these types of game. It feels like an improved and modern experience of a beloved game genre.

Just fantastic. 1990 Vibes again. After 10 minutes I got used to the new artstyle and stopped arguing with it. I didn't expect this but I'm totally sold now. What a lovely game out of time. It continues the story from MI 2 Le Chuck's Revenge. Buy it and support Ron Gilbert. Dive into the good old times, when we all had a selfmade copy of dial a pirate and 3.5" Discs.

Works great on steam deck.
Played it for about two hours so far and its a blast from the past. All the old voices are there and the music is outstanding. The joles are funny and you'll see a lot of old friends :-) If you liked the old ones, you've got to play this one. And 23$ is a absolutely fair price.

After waiting 31 years since MI2, is this worth the wait?
I've not finished the game yet but I'm already glad I bought it and recommend picking it up! Pros and Cons below for anyone that wants to know more.

Pros
- Feels like a classic point-and-click adventure. Makes me feel like a kid growing up in the 90s again!
- After feeling a bit sad to see they weren't using pixel art I'm glad to say the new graphics are charming and do suit the game. I still miss the pixel art but they add nice effects using this art style that they probably couldn't have with pixel art.
- The music and sound are just as good as the original
- It has similar charm and humour to the first 2 games.
- If you haven't played the originals (or played them a while ago and can't remember the plots) there is a journal that sums up the background story nicely.

Cons
- The continuation from the cliff hanger at the end of MI2 is a bit odd and doesn't work in my opinion. Effectively they . This also means . Unfortunately it doesn't really land that well, but it does serve to opens things up for the new story they want to tell. I was never that keen to how MI2 ended anyway so maybe this was for the best anyway.

Very Disappointing game, even though I'm not a huge fan of the art style I still attempted to play this game. Unfortunately the art style was the least of my concerns. The game felt as though it was trying to capitalize on familiar characters yet it lacked the witty dialogue and good voice acting from the original games. It was just not doing it for me. The original monkey island games had good memorable characters, unexpected humor and weird puzzles which this game seems to lack. The whole thing felt like a game aimed towards young children or a new fan base and maybe that's what they were going for, however I think most of their player base is people who remembered and have played the originals. Overall I just think this game lacks the charm and character of the first two games.

30 years later and I finally know the name of the Voodoo lady, let alone get to play the true continuation of the story. This is a game where it's best not to talk about all the amazing things in it, experience it for yourself. Avoid the forums. Avoid YouTube. And avoid your friends and family too so you can play this.

Do it!

I played through to the ending.
Right off the bat things seemed abit disjointed with events not strictly fitting the time line. I thought it might be foreshadowing for a big plot twist that took into account the ending of MI2, the beginning seemed to heavily hint at that. I was expecting something incredibly clever and satisfying because the scrapbook seemed so well thought out.
Other than that it played like a decent Monkey Islands game... until the ending.
I won't spoil it for you, all I'm going to do is say this. If you have any positive memories of this franchise, if you can even half accept the ending of Tales of Monkey Island as being the end then do so. You'll still be able to think of Guybrush Threepwood as a mighty pirate going on swashbuckling adventures.
Monkey Islands was the first game I ever played and since I was... I want to say eight, thats the image I had in my mind. This game will snatch that from you and leave in its place a vanity project. Because if theres one thing writers love to do its to get meta, it reminds you they exist at the expense of the story.
It makes them larger than the characters. I regret playing this.

Product received for free

My feature-length, spoiler-free review can be found at Ars Technica, and while I won't hotlink it here, it's not hard to search for. A snippet from that piece:

Return to Monkey Island is nearly everything I'd hoped for in a modern return to the series. Its interface and controls split the difference between the expectations of hardcore genre fans and those of point-and-click novices. Its presentation and voice acting pair nicely to set an approachable and fiendishly hilarious tone. And the game's full journey, from bumpy waters to smooth, silly sailing, consistently feels personal, vulnerable, and reflective of its creators—which is to say, this is the opposite of a nostalgia-reeking cash-in.

Only a couple of hours in but I love it already. I'm only leaving the review now to share how happy I am with it and encourage others to buy and support Ron and team.

The first 3 monkey Islands are some of my favourite games along with most of the other SCUMM games, Full Throttle, The Dig, Day of the Tentacle etc. I enjoyed most other PaC adventure games too, Broken Sword, Secret Files, Syberia etc. So if you aren't a SCUMM Veteran this may be a review through rose tinted glasses.

The art is great has a fantastic style that feels very handmade and makes it feel personal to me. I don't think I have explained it well but you take see brush strokes and there is a scruffiness to it that has a real charm. The tutorial part put me in mind of Ren and Stimpy with the Art Style, lots of gross! The tutorial is perfect essentially hidden and shows you everything works and is a great introduction and the link to MI 2, beginners will learn old fans will settle in. The voice acting Is as good as you would expect with several previous actors reprising roles. and the dialogue is as funny as ever. There hasn't been enough puzzles to comment yet. Exploring the Nnew Melee Island is brilliant, and seeing all the characters like catching up with old friends.

I will be back to add more to this but from someone that first played Monkey Island about 30 years ago on an Amiga, it is 100% worth getting. Monkey Island is among my earliest of video game memories, I think i was about 5 when I first played it (I didn't get very far)I still have my original Amiga copies of the games. Monkey Island is important to me and I am not disappointed.

Thanks Ron + Team playing this has made and will make me very happy.

p.s. I knew you were going to do it this but it still made me smile seeing the pattern on Stan's coat stay static.

Just my take on RTMI, having been a big fan of the first two games.

- Writing and Humor are still good, and in the same style of the originals

- Good performance. Probably runs on a toaster on low and medium settings.

- Game Design that tailors much more to a casual audience.

- If you were looking for good pixel art in the style of the originals, you may be unhappy with the new artistic direction. There is no misrepresentation about this in the marketing material though, as it is evident from the game trailers.

- The UI feels tailored toward touch interfaces and mobile platforms. Valid actions that can be performed on an object are now presented to the player when they highlight them with the mouse (or an inventory object). That means no more scumm style verb list, and the player losing most of their ability to creativity guess how to interact with game objects.

Overall, I am happy that a new monkey island game has been released. While I understand the desire of the developers to make the game more accessible for a general audience, I only wish the game had included a /"classic mode" that changed the controls and UI to be closer to the style of the originals.

The game was great, it had me laughing and smiling through out the game play with nostalgia almost the entire 12 hours i played, and which i did meet the end of the adventure, and i was quite pleased, this game has heaps of replay ability, and things to interact with, or , with the comic replies and stuff you remember from the other games in the series, i think the art style went well with the game, it gave them more room to add a longer experience then the others. well done developers loved the experience / story and game-play, thank you for bringing another adventure of this series to life, it was an great experience!

Its just so wonderful to be able to revisit Guybrush and company again.
The game looks like a beautifully animated cartoon come to life.
So far I would say it was worth the wait.
Thank you Ron, Dave, Dominic and everyone else involved to allow this game to get made.

First comment on steam, because I enjoy it so much.

It's been years since I've played an adventure - point and click game. This seems to be perfect so far. Already I hope it never ends. Humor, artstyle, music and story are spot on.

NOT TRASH.

Return to Monkey Island is a point-and-click adventure that knows how to leverage its player’s nostalgia while making room for newer pirates to enjoy one last ride.

LOOK BEHIND YOU, A THREE-HEADED MONKEY
Steals Steam Awards

Return to Monkey Island (abridged to RTMI from now on) is the latest instalment in the series after 13 years and 30 years since the adventures of our favourite pirate started.

Despite what we initially thought, RTMI didn’t make a big plea about the past and the nostalgia of the previous adventures. Quite the opposite, while the game will successfully capture the spirit of what made this series great, it is simultaneously building a brand-new adventure.

This is a model of how the old can become new again in an era of reboots and remakes of all kinds and terrible ports. Granted, it still includes some nostalgia factor and inside jokes, but it never felt like you had to be aware of the previous episodes to catch up with this one.

And just like that, Guybrush Threepwood, our main protagonist, is embarking on a new adventure, probably his last one. Our old companions are also there, and so is LeChuck, our Nemesis.

Though Guybrush is no longer the young pirate he used to be, we are reliving his glory days on a park bench as he tells his kid this story. While I am probably reading too much into it, this is a strong symbol of the passing of time as some of us discovered these games while we were kids and are now old enough to show them to our kids.

In another silly narrative plot filled with puns about everything, including how long it took them to make another game, RTMI still managed to make me chuckle and laugh. Some of the interactions are witty, some plain funny, and I enjoyed listening to what felt like a full-blown course about ship Anchors. It is a simple game that modernised its approach towards everything, from the UI and character design that is more developed than ever down to the movements. Yet, they managed to improve their gameplay while keeping the core they had from the beginning.

In terms of point-and-click adventure, it is a good experience for returning pirates and new pirates alike. The puzzles will require a bit of logic or the usual let’s see if I can fit every single item I possess into this keyhole, and while you know it won’t work, you’ll do it anyway.

There are two game modes, hardcore and casual, that are both self-explanatory. The puzzles' quality and difficulty drastically change depending on the mode. With the hardcore mode being headache-inducing while trying to figure out some of the solutions, I am currently writing this review on 2 ibuprofens, taking a break from something that’ll make me roll my eyes behind my skull for not being able to see it before.

Should you struggle at any point, RTMI has a built-in Voodoo-powered Book that gives you hints throughout your adventure. Without spoiling at any point, the answers it is merely a guide that will help you figure out the piece of the puzzle you were so cruelly missing. Maybe I should take the hint and use it more.

At times, you will feel at an impasse, and while it may be possible that you are with items in your inventory that don’t make sense then, do not give up. You will need to pay close attention to your surroundings until you get the aha moment or the eye roll moment I so eloquently explained two paragraphs above. Sometimes the solution does defy imagination.

We rarely hear of adventure games as of late, but RTMI manages to make you remember what they are: fun games. Period.

Verdict

Finally, RTMI is a heartfelt testimony to the series, a throwback to point-and-click adventures of old while modernising everything in this game series, they managed to send a love letter to their previous games without taking anything away from this last adventure. It has everything for it to succeed; with good writing, dad jokes and puzzles that can be just frustrating enough, RTMI is a beautiful adventure to embark on. They gave a new breath into an old universe.

Yet, if this is truly the end, I wish you farewell Guybrush and thank you for all the adventures that marked me as a kid.

It's a total success in its every single action, puzzle, resolution and environment. It's exactly what you might expect from Monkey Island. If there's a way to improve this, it was not invented yet.

I pre-ordered it as soon as I knew it was available for it. It's absolutely worth every single coin.

A pirate I was meant to be!
Trim the sails and roam the sea!

We're thieving balladeers.
A gang of cutthroat mugs.
To fight us off ye don't need guns!
Just really good ear plugs!

A pirate I was meant to be!
Trim the sails and roam the sea!

We'll fight you in the harbor.
We'll battle you on land.
But when you meet singing pirates...
They'll be more than you can stand.

A pirate I was meant to be!
Trim the sails and roam the sea!

We're a pack a´ scurvy sea dogs.
Have we pity? Not a dram!
We all eat roasted garlic...
...then sing from the diaphragm!

A pirate I was meant to be!
Trim the sails and roam the sea!

If ye try ta fight us...
...you will get a nasty whackin´!
If ya disrespect our singing´...
...we will feed ya to a kraken!

A pirate I was meant to be!
Trim the sails and roam the sea!

We're troublesome corsairs!
And we've come to steal your treasures!
We would shoot you on the downbeat...
...but we have to rest five measures.

A pirate I was meant to be!
Trim the sails and roam the sea!

The game has all the conveniences of modern design while still having involved puzzles like older adventure games (admittedly this did feel a little bit on the easier end but I might be better at solving these puzzles now).
The story perfectly captures the sense of zany adventure that drew me to these games when I was a kid.



Don't think I could have hoped for a better sendoff to the series. A sequel may come out but at least the game does give enough closure for the third grader in me who played LeChuck's revenge pre-installed on his home pc.

I mean it's Monkey Island. Who dosen't like Guybrush and his tales?
You're looking for silly jokes? You got that here.
You're a fan of the old game? You find your self very quickly at home here.

music, art style and the dialogs got the typical Monkey Island DNA !
The last hours I keped grining full of joy.
And look behind you there is a 3-headed monkey!

Great to see the series return back to it's original roots. A fantastic point and click adventure. Nice looking animation and art style. If you thoroughly enjoyed playing the first 3 Monkey Island games. You will definitely enjoy playing Return to Monkey Island.

An instant buy for me!!

Well thought out puzzles that don't feel silly or too hard to figure out, The hint system is nice, it lets you get minor hints or just the entire answer if you need it. The dialogue is smartly written and will have lines that get you chuckling. All the references to the older games are nice to see without it feeling too forced. Feels like it fits right in with the series while making its own interesting choices. A must play if you've enjoyed any of the others, or adventure games in general.

The good: It's Monkey Island, lots of old characters, good dialogue, memorable settings.

The bad: The new art style, they took away they "talk/take/look" coin and it just decided what to do for you, the art style, the game is too easy and the puzzles aren't hard because the dialogue basically gives everything away and they also give you a hint book on top of that, the art style.

I am giving it a thumbs up because I love this franchise and would love to see another made in the future. Hopefully one that fixes some of the mistakes this one made.

IMO, not bad, too easy. I am on chapter 4 after 5 hours playing and I feel like a free tour. Not a single challenge. Even some times puzzles are being resolved in cascade in less 5 minutes. Very predictive. I am a bit sad about, I expected more difficult experience, less obvious sollutions and more hilarious puzzles.

DIFFICULTY (hard mode): 3/10 (too easy)
VISUALS: 7/10 (not bad, not really inmersive)
MUSIC: 5/10 (just ok, not touched by)
SOUNDS FX: 6/10 (I expected more ambient sounds)
DIALOGS: 6/10 (just a bit flat IMO. I expected more jokes, more hilarious situations)
CHARTACTERS: 3/10 (just like dialogs, I feel them flat, I have no empathy to no one)

Final thaugts, 4/10. A game made with love but with a very low budget and huge tecnical limitations marked by this budget.

The curse of monkey island should mark the new basis to build this new game IMO.

I had my doubts when seeing the Horrible Art Design in trailers, but just an hour in and I can tell that this is well worth buying, It's classic (and modern) Ron Gilbert stuff, the Art Design is Horrible but looking at the backgrounds it has that Day of the Tentacle style but the characters are not great to look at and the overlap between player and background is a little blurry but I put that down to the Design of the Art being Horrible.

The Voice Acting is GREAT

The Interface menu is .. different.. objects have a 'pre-interaction verb' so its not like clicking 'Give, Open, Close, Pick up, Look at, Talk to, Use, Push, Pull' .. It is 2022 after all and its not like condensed verbs would make for easier puzzles... It even just locks you out from trying certain objects on other objects.. (I really don't mind hearing ' I don't think that will work' over and over)

I dislike the 'To Do' list I first saw it in Thimble weed park, I played Police Quest in 1988 and I survived without a 'To Do' list ... well I didn't I died and failed all the time but that's not my point, it just seems that combined with the 'Auto-Verb' it feels a bit 'Easy-Mode' but I get it kids today have zero attention span ( I just hope it doesn't try to relate to them later by talking about tik-tok or Karens etc.

The Art Design is .. not great, Monkey Island 1 & 2 were visually consistent and wonderfully animated given that pixel art was just a limitation of the day, Monkey Island 3 looked like an interactive Disney Cartoon, pretty but quite the change, Monkey Island 4 was just made too soon the leap to 3D was a bad idea and looked .. Horrible. TT's Tales of Monkey Island was a good step forward for a 3D interface. The Special Editions looked bad, but playing with the Great Voice Acting was great after 20 years.
THIS GAME didn't need to be Pixel Art and I suppose after doing Thimbleweed Park in a Maniac Mansion style, Ron went with something different The elongated faces and warping effect animation just doesn't suit me. I just wished he had gone with a cartoon base that had the look and scale of Monkey Island 1 & 2.

Ultimately despite the 'H.A.D' and as a P'n'C O.G I recommend this game.

Captain Ron (and Crew) are legends and I hope they don't take any negative reviews to heart, we all want what we want (some people are just lil' crybabies about it). I just hope that if someone were to .. remake.. the visuals for this game, that the developers wont take it too personally and embrace it :)

Also now Johnny is out I'd love to see a Monkey Island Movie

It didn't take me long to fall absolutely in love with this game. I've been a fan of the series since the age of 14, when I bought Monkey Island 2, my first legally-obtained game. The writing is phenomenal. Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman have imbued the game with all the wit and charm that the originals had, but with the experience of master craftsman who have honed their craft over several decades. Likewise, the music by series and industry veterans McConnell et al helps to marry familiar nostalgia with touches of novelty. The art style, though, brings the whole experience together. Divisive as it is, the abstract nature can almost be seen as a metaphor for the way an ageing gamer, and ageing developers, look back on the past three decades. Familiar shapes, yes, but the detail isn't quite as it was, like a faded memory. Personally, I really love the look, and I appreciate that they had the boldness to go with something really unusual. It hearkens back to that period of rapid innovation in gaming in the '90s when developers were constantly coming up with something new, trying out different things. Not the samey archetypes big-budget titles tend to latch onto nowadays.

In terms of gameplay, it handles fantastically on a controller. The hint system is great, and really helps to cut down on the frustration of getting stuck, without giving the solution away immediately. The inventory system is very easy to manage.

A final few things I appreciate:
- The trivia cards that can be collected in the game.
- The writers' cut, which will justify another playthrough to hear dialogue that has been edited down for the better.
- Useless horse armour DLC for preordering.
- The sense of humour and nostalgia that doesn't seem stuck in the past.

While I still have 3/4 of the game to finish, I can absolutely recommend this to Monkey Island fans who have played all of them, both the good ones and the bad ones, and maybe even to those curious to experience the franchise for the first time. It doesn't try to outshine or replace any of the others. Rather, it's a love letter to both the series and the fans, not merely a jaded original creator's crack at the sequel he never got to make until now.

Over an hour into the game, and so far the only humour has been "hey do you remember this character" or "Hey do you remember this from the first two games"

£20 for a pile of references is a big ask

It takes a while, but it gets there.

Positive
+ Movement is smooth AND fast if you want it
+Soundtrack
+Dominic Armato
+More Ship freedom/options
+Classic Locations
+Great New Locations
+Addressing the Actual Secret
+The Skip/Repeat feature (what did she say? Click back with one button)

Negative
-No Island comes close to Plunder or Phatt from the previous games (Melee has way less POI's)
-8 hours in so far (part 4) and no really great "Aha!" moments with puzzles yet
-On Screen Inventory button (easy to miss click)
-Cutscenes look like 2000's flash cartoons
-Couple other inventory problems
-LeChuck's VA should have been switched with Gullet's

7.5/10 So far.
Thank God my worries were resolved

Neutral
*Art Style isn't as original as the other games (subjective, but comparable)
*Like 90% of the new characters are women. Not bad, just very noticeable, esp when Gybrush is corrected on pronouns.
*The idle/sway animations work well for some characters, and not well for others
*Hard to tell what is what some certain characters (is that an arm, or a tie?)

Quick review of the first chapter of this game.

I like the "monkey island feel" but I dont like the graphics. I thought , after seeing the previews , that I would get over that part of playing the game.

That did not seem the case . Yes you can tell Ron is on this game. But this graphic style.. I even would like it better if he made it like the remake of MI 1 and MI 2.. Dit is overshadowing my love for tthe game.

I stopped playing now , I will come back when I am done with Disney.

Do I regret from buying it , NO.. Would I recommend it , NO...

Outstanding return to form for Ron Gilbert. The humor is as great as ever, I personally love the artstyle, the puzzles feel spot on and it even runs great on Steam Deck with a stable 60fps when set to High Setting. I am deeply in love with this game. You still got it Ron.

TL;DR Monkey Island fans will be severely disappointed.

In past Monkey Island games the developers spiced up the game play by sending players to brand new locations in each new title, that were all full of beautiful scenery, wonderfully interesting characters and fantastic puzzles. Not so in this game.

In Return to Monkey Island you literally return to what you already know. The game plays like a creatively bankrupt revisiting or reimagining of (mostly) the first Monkey Island game. The developers apparently took "Return" to Monkey Island too literally and it goes a bit like this: Oh hi <character from former game> in <location from former game that looks just slightly different>.
Now don't misunderstand me, revisiting characters and locales from former games is great, but that is the key element of Return to Monkey Island, which is absolutely absurd.

On to puzzles, of which there is only one in the first two hours or so. ONE. Otherwise the game is almost on rails instead of giving the player a major objective and letting them figure what to do themselves. That said, I'd say that developers were more influenced by Telltale story games than by Monkey Island itself.

As if this all weren't bad enough, there is figuratively speaking of course a cherry on top as garnish, which is obviously the extremely controversial art style that has been at the center of discussion.

The art style in Monkey Island 1 to 3 was absolutely wonderful. One of the greatest things about Monkey Island is finding a new scene to enjoy. You would always stop just to admire the artists beautiful rendition of the world, with all of it satisfying nooks, crannies and enjoyable tidbits. Some of my best memories of Monkey Island are doing just that. This marvelous and charming art was the framework for the story and adventures you had with Guybrush. When it all fell into place, there was a special spot in this overarching scheme for every wonderful experience you ever had, like discovering the mystery of the El Chupacabra chicken demon.

This art style, however, is not beautiful. It is not interesting, appealing or charming in any way. I could possibly live with that, but the art style in Return to Monkey Island is in fact incredibly irritating and just plain appalling. The characters are just barely acceptable, but the scenery is made up of wildly garbled geometric shapes that are completely out of any logical or coherent proportion. It is probably the most atrocious art style I ever laid my eyes upon in a video game. I am absolutely astonished how it could have ever possibly been greenlighted.

All said, this game feels like it was churned out the with the least amount of effort, by a development team that does not care about Monkey Island or understand what made it so great in the first place. The game play and art style are absolutely preposterous, which is why I give this game the lowest rating of any Monkey Island game. As you might suspect, I am indeed a huge Monkey Island fan and have therefore played every single title in this series. Some are great, some are forgettable, but none of them are unacceptable. That was until today.

4/10

And remember: Never pay more than 20 bucks for a video game.

Graphics are deeply irritating - particularly the weird jelly-wobble heads. Despite the obvious effort, this is an extraordinarily mediocre job and just about everything about the gameplay and story is frankly annoying. Not a patch on the original. 20 mins in was enough! Sorry Ron & co - know how important this game is for you but had to vent somewhere.

I was already quite disappointed by the graphic choice. very very very cheap flash animation with very horrible childish design. I selected the max difficulty and in few hours i arrived at part 4 easily. Now I'm very pissed seein how this is a complete disappointment. What Gilbert had in mind? why he revived the series with such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sequel? Dialogues are boring, he removed the sword duels with mockery, there's no challenge, the story and the enigmas are stupid, action is only 2, sometimes 1: Examine or pick up/use.
This is a game for children.
Monkey Island 1-2-3 (which i loved) were not.
Probably Gilbert needed money and accept this disney ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, welldone.

Style is very off putting, but its monkey island.

If it had a special edition with OG pixel art it would be 10/10

If you really need a new monkey island game in your life, its worth it.

Right.... yes I was going to slam this but im very surprised and happy.

I was going to give the art style 1/10 but its really neat and fun so I give it 5/10

The Scumm bar has a bit of wokeness in it.. you will soon see but thankfully Guybrush agrees says hes prefers the other pirates and yes I agree so do I.

Loving it so far and not done act 1 yet but id recommend this game!

I played for like half an hour, that was enough. In this game, you go through a very corny prologue where you learn that the point and click adventure mechanics have been dumbed down in a way that means that there is no way this game could be challenging, because everything is either left or right click. You start where the 2nd game ended, but everything has been rewritten in a way that makes you wonder why you even started the game here. Your parents aren't actually your parents, but a random couple. Kid Guybrush is not actually kid Guybrush, but Guybrush's son. Lazy writing.

I could see that the level of care put into this game was nowhere near the others. For instance, in the first one, you walk into the scumm bar, you meet a guy named Mancomb Seepgood who makes fun of your name. You meet another guy who only wants to talk about The Loom, hilariously and shamelessly advertising the company's previous game in a very self aware kind of way. you meet a dog who can teach you about Lechuck. the pirates in the Scumm bar in this game don't have dialogue options, they just tell you to head to the back. I know that seems like a stupid thing to complain about, but after the bad impression the prologue left, I took that to be indicative of what was to come, and the lack of care and enthusiasm put into the details, which were what made the other games great. The little bit of this game I played felt like a cheap cash in and it's really upsetting because I love this series so much. I won't be the first to mention that this game felt like it was aimed at a younger audience, which is just so dumb because the first one came out before I was born and I felt too old for this game. Waiting on approval for my refund. Sorry Ron but I think you've lost your touch.

A huge reason I love the previous games is the great art styles and expressive characters (especially Curse - it was like a Don Bluth film).
Return To Monkey Island opts for a bare-bones art style and animation style that is either very lazy, or very cheap to do (or both). The characters have black dots for eyes, and they don't express anything through their faces. It looks like something I could make in After Effects in an afternoon.

It's just devoid of any charm or soul that the other games had. I was really looking forward to this, but I won't be carrying on.

This game absolutely captures the feel of the first two games, following on directly from the 2nd but also acknowledging the games that came after it (play it and find out!). The art style and controls were jarring at first but very quickly grew to love them and it works well, absolutely worth the wait. Will definitely be playing through this one again to uncover more of the stuff i missed on first playthrough.

I was a bit hesitant about the new art style when the game was first announced but after playing it all fears were alleviated. I absolutely love it, it looks gorgeous!!!
Did I mention it's MONKEY ISLAND!?!

I played all the Monkey Island games (yes, also Tales of Monkey Island) and I can say, that it's the Monkey Island game every fan has been waiting for. What's more: even those new to the series will get a lot of joy out of it. Even on hardcore mode it provides you with tools to make the puzzling life of Guybrush Threepwood easier. The humour sometimes references parts from the old games, but they're not overbearing. Most jokes are fresh and without any game reference. I'm in the third chapter and so far did not regret the pre-order. I still wonder, if there is at least ONE use case for the horse armour.

Wow, the story continues in unexpected and fun directions! :3

Just about the only somewhat confusing aspect for me is, that Le Chuck seems to have lost his edge? When you arrive in Chapter one, no one is afraid of the old ghost anymore. Our heroic victories and narrow escapes of the past are only mildly amusing to the populace, if that. Not sure if I did that aspect, because yes, you are Guybrush Threepwood, and you *did* best the ghost and zombie pirate LeChuck! And it was dangerous! It was a thrill! Evil, bloodthirsty pirate, murderer and zombie all in one. How could that not be fearsome? Will he drink a grog in the Scumm Bar and no one will bat an eye?
I guess that is for me to find out. In time.

While I am not keen about what it much of the game looks like in terms of style, the colours and overall aesthetics are beautiful! The voice cast is amazing, and there is much heart, work and effort put into those lines!

Can't wait to see how the story continues on! I will update this review. In time.

A fantastic return to form, my initial concerns about the art style quickly evaporated once i actually started playing (although I'm still not quite sold on how LeChuck looks). The humour is spot on, the voice acting is great. If you have liked any previous Monkey Island game, you will love this! You only really need to have played the first 2 games although all 5 are canon as confirmed by certain pieces of dialogue, so if you have never played a Monkey Island game before I would recommend playing the HD Special Editions of the first 2 games before playing this, but i think you could dive straight in as a first timer, you would just miss out on quite a lot.

As a big Monkey Island fan from MI on the amiga 500 right up to Tales of Monkey island big box deluxe edition on pc.
This game will always have a special place in my heart .
This game is no exception i am around 10 mins in and im already love again .
It has the humour and charm you'd expect from a Monkey Island game .
Graphics are a unique style , but still very good and enjoyable .
I will say i am only a few mins in but have already visited places from the other games so i would play the others first .

I do hope this game can bring around some remakes as in full scale remakes with full throttle , day of the tentacle and grim fandango included .

Their is really is nothing to dislike in this games or any other of series as long as you like point and click , pirates and have a sense of humour you will love this .

Some puzzles can be a little strange but its usually for comedic value and it usually gets it spot on .

Just buy this game and have a laugh for a few hours :)

Only played it 4 hours so far, but I am completely in love and cannot believe that we are finally, after 32 years, getting a sequel to one of the greatest Point'N'Click Advenasdtures of all tasdme. The charme, the humour, the dialogue - it is all still here and it really feels like a return. Not only to Monkey Island, but to a time where games where about enjoying the experience without any competition, lootboxes, microtransactions or edgyness. And don't get me wrong, I love playing new games, but Return to Monkey Island just hits all the right notes. 10/10

The magic is back!

This is Monkey Island again. Now with new updated graphics and a little more politically correct as everything else... The magic and feeling of the original Monkey Island 1 & 2 is right here also. Don't understand all the childish rant about the graphics? The graphics are really nice and cosy and warm. It gives the feeling of nostalgia also right away with a touch of something new at the same time. It's really impressive that they manage to make this kind of game after all these years! Many others have tried to relive the magic of the old and failed, but not this people. They managed to continue the magic from the old days and bring it into the present! Thanks ❤️

Amazing game that sparks the nostalgia, beautiful fresh modern 2D art style, great and funny animations, the same kind of comedy as all those years ago now wrapped in an entirely new (fine leather) jacket. And the story? *chefs kiss*

Where Monkey Island 2 left us in with questions in the end of the game, R2MI ties into it, it all makes sense now.
Everything just clicks. The music, the atmosphere, Dominic Armato's voice, and all the characters we love so much making a comeback, some even giving fan-service (Tell me about LOOM!). Overall a really good game I enjoy playing, and will be playing for much much longer!

For the people who haven't played any other Monkey Island games before this one: Please, do play Monkey Island 1 & 2 (preferably before R2MI)! I promise you, if you like this game, you'll have a great time playing the others.

Thank you Ron Gilbert and the entire team for giving us the Monkey Island game we have all been dreaming about!

LOOK BEHIND YOU! A THREE HEADED MONKEY!

I am thoroughly happy with the game that Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman, David Fox, Rex Crowle and the team at Terrible Toybox have created. It truly is a sequel to Monkey Island II and done with love, wit and intelligence without actually throwing out any of the games after. You'll have to play to truly understand. This is a love letter and a great one at that. I am now in Part II and am only quitting because I need sleep. I after all was a child the first time I met Guybrush.

Was sceptical at first with the art style, but really glad I got this game as it brings it all back.
I am not disappointed!!!

The ART grew on me fast and the story and gameplay is just like the old days. Up to Part II and having a great time.

Big Thanks to Ron and the team!

That said, I can't say I'm a the biggest fun of the new art style, but this is simply a matter of taste. The visuals are objectively very good and immersive.

The game continues the story right where Monkey Island 2 ended. BUT, some elements from the next games (not made by the entire original team) are also mixed up, so, you're on for a great adventure. Don't let the change of design fool you, this is 100% classic Monkey Island feeling. No problem if you didn't play parts 1 and 2, there's a small catch-up at the beginning so you know crucial parts of the story. Beautiful, fun and addictive adventure game, play it now!

4 hours into the game and really liking the game so far. Ron and Team captured the spirit of the original games and delivered a modern version rooted in the fun and adventurous feeling from the past.

The artwork fits the style and makes this game stand out from other more recent adventure games. You can tell that the team enjoyed working on this game and treated everything with care.

Also, seeing the LucasFilm logo brought back some good memories. Really enjoying it... and for $25, it's worth every buck.

It's the Monkey Island we all know and love with a new spin on the old locations. With new puzzles and a good new storyline it is a lot of fun!

For now, it's everything I ever wanted it to be!
Art, music, dialogs and voice actors are incredibly well done and simply on point, just what you'd expect from Monkey Island.
If you're a fan of the series you'll feel right at home.

Besides that: It plays perfectly well on the Steam Deck too!
You can even lower the TDP and GPU clock _way_ down to save some battery while still hitting 30 frames (locked) with ease, even in docked mode.

Well done folks!

4 hours in and it is an absolute blast. Been playing Monkey Island since Secret back in the 90s and this has the same charm as the first ones. Laughed out loud several times.
So far the riddles are not that challenging but the dialogue makes up for it.

TLDR UP FRONT - Enjoy the game, it is a fun, well written game that the developers made a stylistic choice with.

Look, I get it, I COMPLETELY understand why people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the graphics.... this isn't 1996 and this game is NOT PaRappa the Rapper... which this game looks A LOT like. But, it's like this - this is art, and this was the choice the artists made - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ take it or leave it, or do it yourself. This game has a lot of the same writing styling of the original games. It also seems, as one would expect (due to the sad state of modern gaming and shareholders being what they are - modern games are easier than they used to be generally) to cater to a younger audience, or perhaps another way to say it, would be to be more accessible to a broader audience and as a result subsequent level of ability.
The bottom line is that this can scratch the itch of a long time fan but will not be the masterpiece they were expecting.

Does that mean that this game isn't good? ♥♥♥♥ off... things are not so black and white.

Music - 10/10 because it's on brand and this is a recognizable franchise and the music is spot on

Game-play - 7/10 it's fine, point and click adventure, this is subjective and will or wont annoy you but is on par with the genre

Sound - 7/10 some of the dialogue is long winded, and you can skip it which is a plus, but sometimes you can interrupt while clicking on things and it's just a product of the game type that this can be interrupted so it's mostly fine.

Voice acting - 10/10 look, it's like an audio book in the way that many RPG games are just narrative and story driven pieces of art. This one has the brunt of the work being carried on the shoulders of the voice acting, where the visuals take a back seat to the voice acting

For me, it's a solid purchase, but i'm a long time fan. For someone new to the franchise, maybe start with some other games in the series (in order would be smart) and come back to this one and by then it'll be on sale. This franchise is to date one of my all time top 5 games. So far, this one has not let me down in any way except for the graphics which I can overlook as a stylistic choice. I HATED borderlands cell shading and eventually pushed past that because I enjoyed the game-play so much.

There where a few moments, where I felt like I was back in my childhood playing the first games.
The game is good, but its not the magical story of the first two games. But it's certainly a trilogy now.

Once again we get an absolute gem of a game.
It has everything the original Monkey Island games had: Puzzles, fun, amazing dialogues and a great story.
Unfortunately there were tons of haters before the game was even released complaining about the art style while calling themselves "true Monkey Island fans".
Well, the game is here and it feels like true Monkey Island.
Once again I can relive that amazing experience I missed so much in point and click games.
The game is an absolute gem.

Yes, the art style is different and yes, everyone has their own taste in art. But the game is 100% Monkey Island and people that hate about the art, probably never understood what makes Monkey Island so amazing.

If you're one of these haters, don't play the game, it's just not for you. Go buy some crazy 4K DLSS Raytracing graphics festival and make your 3090 sweat hard.

But if you actually ARE a true Monkey Island fan, don't wait any longer! Get it and play it. You won't regret it!

Let's get one thing out of the way first:
It's bloody Monkey Island, alright?! Good old p&c adventure joy and lunacy.

As many have stated already, the trailers never did the art style justice. To my eye, it looks perfectly natural and captures the feel of the first two games in a weird but appropriate way. If you're one of the few that tell themselves that they don't like it, do yourself a favour and give it a try (and refund it if you don't like it after all). I bet six pieces o' eight that you won't regret it.

I'm only roughly two and a half hours in and have merely scratched the surface, presumably. But I'd like to point one thing that you will notice right at the very beginning (well, after the prelude). The Secret of Monkey Island engrained a lot of stuff into our brains, let me tell you. The moment you set foot on Mêlée Island™ you will feel right at home and know your way around but it still feels fresh. Spoiler alert: It's going to be a heartbreaking to see the place in its current state. Curses, Cpt. Madison!!

I'm excited to see where the journey will take us.

The artwork works much better in motion than it does in still shots, and the writing and humor of the game are just as good as the early ones (which makes sense, since it's the same folks who wrote this one). It's a very welcome addition to the Monkey Island series.

A few hours in, and all I can say is that this scratches that itch. The Monkey Island series is a huge part of my childhood. The art is different but it works, and the heart, fun and creativity of the originals are there.

Edit: Finally done. I cried. It is silly to cry at a game. I'd never thought I would. But I played the original MI with my dad when I was 10 years old. He's no longer with us. But the entire way that this game is set up (don't want to spoil, but you find out early how the story is going to be told), has so much heart, so much love. If you have any fond memories at all of the original, you really gotta try this out.

First the background resolution is horrible aliasing everywhere on all backgrounds,

The art style is so distracting and bad it hurts the game in so many ways.

The writing and voice acting are on par with everything else from the remastered and I enjoy them very much.

I understand the hatred of the old verb systems but this has been reduced to feeling like you are coddled.

You can't rebind keys I had to use G Hub to put I, O, T, ALt+S and Alt+L on my mouse so that I can play with mouse only and have shortcuts.

The UI was clearly designed for phones which I am sure is where most of the sales of PnC adventures games are but, its glaring.

Runs fine for me and I have seen no bugs at all.

My 7 year old daughter loves it to death and in anticipation of this release played EfMI remaster ,MILR remaster and CoMI the Scumm upres. Her teacher at school agreed to allow this to be her reading homework I just forgot to tell her about voice acting, whoops. Good to see that this game series can still appeal to kids though.

For its price I would recommend giving this a play through as it is enjoyable and I can only hope that if we get any future versions they will reconsider the difficulty and art direction as it makes a good game feel cheap.

Was initially shocked by the art style, but it is much better when you are actually playing it - and like any other really immersive game, you kind of forget about it after a few minutes and just enjoy the experience. As a LucasArts fan - this is amazing - so much nostalgia, yet even more accessible, and easy to play. Hints if you need them. I've only played the hard mode so far and only used the hint book twice, so if you've played adventure games before definitely go that route. Music / sound is beautiful. Many laugh out loud moments. So far so good!

Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Funny, charming, challenging. And I've only played it for 3 hours.
Ron, Dave and co. have pulled off an impossible feat.
An absolute masterclass on how to make adventure games - and great sequels.
This is the Monkey Island I remember from 30 years ago.
Hope the creators get another chance to make more.
Bravo.

Haven't finished the game yet, but it's utterly fantastic so far!
Humor is top notch, lots of good callbacks, and some new elements too.
People were really pissed about the graphics at first, but I always thought it was silly since the style resembles the world sprites of the characters in the original. In fact, I think the seemingly vector based graphics look great with great dynamic lighting effects to boot.

The only downside about this game is that the puzzles are a tad easier than the older games (even on the Hard Mode - Mega Monkey Equivalent this game has) but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.

Currently on Part 4. (I presume out of 5)

Pros:
+True Monkey Island!! From the original creator, Ron Gilbert!!
+Art style and direction, colors, character designs and animations are all fun and perfect for the setting.
+UI is smooth, simple and does not detract from the visuals
+Music is amazing and is equal parts nostalgia and new.
+Puzzles (hard mode) are what any fans of the series have come to expect and range from easy to very difficult (but logical and with little to no frustration). Very satisfying to finally solve the harder ones that have been blocking your progress for awhile
+Solid voice acting (for the most part). The returning cast--Guybrush (Dominic Armato!!), Carla, Voodoo Lady, Murray, Elaine, Wally, etc.--are all very good...buuuuut (see cons)...

Cons:
-Some of the voice acting is a little flat and uninspired. Also I also would have loved Earl Boen's LeChuck and Patrick Pinney's Stan to return to their roles here! (New LeChuck is ok, Stan is...oi...)
-Script, story, and humor take a little while to get going. I realized this con was probably being influenced by my love for the "laugh-a-minute" humor in Curse (which wasn't Ron Gilbert's game)...once I recalibrated my expectations to be more in line with 1 and 2, in which the humor was more subtle, I relaxed a little. And to those just starting out: Stay with it! It gets funnier! :D

Overall:
I would definitely recommend this game to anyone! I'm just really glad to have a new chapter of Monkey Island...those of us who grew up with this series know the special feeling when those games were released, and are undoubtedly feeling that same feeling now! Those new to the series will definitely want to go check out the earlier entries as well!

As many others, I am not thrilled about the art style, but it works well enough for this game. What matters is gameplay, and while I have only reached chapter III so far, it's been a blast playing.
Puzzles so far feel like they are a tad easier than in the old games, but just a bit. They're also mostly logical, no outlandish solutions.
This game also feels very much like a true MI game, and it respects the earlier games. The game starts you out on Melee, and the locations feels like Melee from the first game, not the horrors from MI4.

The controls feel nice, point and click, most actions are done through the right/left mouse buttons directly. Character movement is pretty nice and fast, so you don't feel walking back and forth between locations is a chore, getting around is pretty quick.

All in all, this have been a very enjyable game so far. It's good having most of the old team back making this.

I don't want to brag when i'm saying that i got to part 5 in less than 6 hours, also i selected the hard version.
What i want to say is, that It actually doesn't feel like the "use everything with everything in order to find a solution" games, you're used to from previous Monkey Island versions.
Why do i still love it then?
Because of the millions of memories this new Monkey Island version brings back, all the little reminders and hidden things you can discover.
It actually doesn't even matter if you can play through this game in less than half a day (probably).
It is still worth the whole price, cause everything about it is great. Story, graphics, ... just love it.

3hrs in and this feels a trip down memory lane.
The music is there (of course up to these times in quality).
The game is there: simple point and click, slick and intuitive interface, a pleasure to go around the locations.
The wit and humor is there - now with voices!

So far, I feel like I'm 30 years younger. Thank you mr Gilbert.

The Return of Ron Gilbert! I have been waiting for this game for over 30 years and it doesn't disappoint. Going back to Melee Island and seeing some old and new faces is amazing. The humour is still there and I highly recommend to all that have played Monkey 1&2 first time around.

Thanks Ron, Dave & the team. This 1 has been well worth the wait! ;)

At first I was very pessimistic, but then I heard the title melody and it reminded me of old times, good times. And even though everything is different, it felt so familiar. As if I had come back home and pick up where I left off as a child. Back to Monkey Island. I mean...Return to Monkey Island. Lovin' it!

I'm short on two hours of play as i'm writing this. I have to say i really like it so far.

I played all versions of all the games since the original ones (yes i'm that old). The only thing i have against it yet is that i think its too easy since the left/right click options highlight on interactive elements makes a lot of things obvious. Iirc the other games made you search more.

On the art style, of course matters of taste are always subjective but i personally got used to it very fast and i think it suits the series and the gameplay well.

If you are a fan you should try it out. Get a refund if you don't like it.

Looks great so far! don't listen to the ones complaining about the artstyle.. It does grow on you, and I gotta praise how they brought back the IMUSE-style soundtrack transitions, they really made it work.
There's a lot of fan service and little nudges here and there, this is clearly for the fans for the saga. You can collect stamps, usually one on each area that have some trivia questions to test your knowledge about the games (they are easier to find than the specks of dust from Thimbleweed Park though).
One thing I wish they had done is have anm easier way to open the inventory.. like middle click or some keyboard key (if there's one it isn't obvious or easy to reach). But I like that double clicking always speeds up Guybrush movement.

Incredible game so far. The team is a brilliant mix of seasoned pros, bringing combined decades+ of experience, and fresher faces. And that really reflects in the game - it manages to feel new and utterly familiar all at once. The writing is impeccable, the puzzles are rewarding without ever (so far) being impossible.

I'm a lifelong Monkey Island fan, it's ingrained in my soul. So far, this game stands out as one of the best. It's visually stunning, utterly charming, perfect as its own thing and also as part of the series.

The voice acting is outstanding. There's a perfect blend of new and old characters. Replaying the old MI games is like looking through a family photo album and reliving memories. Return is like going to a party full of family you haven't seen in years. It's warmth, it holds you, you laugh, you cry.

I'm only up to Chapter 3 - had to force myself to stop so that I can savour this. I'm playing on Hard Mode and haven't required a hint yet. It remains to be seen how much more difficult it gets, but if you're not a seasoned adventurer don't feel like you can't opt for the full puzzle experience.

I'll come back to update at the end but I feel confident in saying that this game is everything I could have ever wished for. I'm not here for answers, I'm here to spend time with a story that feels like home. And boy, does it feel like home.

Return to monkey Island is, first and foremost a return to the roots of the serie. It feels good to be back in the Caribbeans. The art style is wonderful, the humour on point. I'm not sure about the puzzles yet, but I've got a good feeling about it so far.

Monkey Island is back! I mean, the real Monkey Island"tm" ;)
The game plays great, it has that "original Monkey Island" feel we (at least I did) missed for such a long time.
The art style in the game is fantastic, it does fit the story/environment/gameplay completely.
Congrats to Ron, Dave, and all the Team ;)

I played the first two original games back in the day (not pirated or anything) and loved them. Also, really enjoying this title! It feels warm and nostalgic but with a modern touch.

Visually, i love all the conversational close-ups. They bring out the personality of characters in a great way.

Puzzles are intuitive and not too difficult in the early parts of the game, but the trivia cards though.. you cant really load a saved game and try again in case you pick the wrong answer :P Oh well, at this rate, i hope ill get at least ONE by the time i reach the end of this excellent adventure.

Five out of five mops!

I absolutely love this game. So many insider jokes (including trivia), such an easy handling and I also dig the new artwork. It feels right and for me personally, takes me back 20 years when I played the old ones on PC. Thanks for all the work that went into this! And now watch out, there is a 3 headed monkey behind you!

I simply just love Monkey Island, I am still in Part 1 but I can not disregard the fact that I am in love and remembering the good old times when I still was playing Monkey Island with Disk and Dial a Pirate to enter the game in MS-DOS.

For all those who are loving Monkey Island, I have no issues so far with the graphics, its great and easy to get used to and also it give a lot more detail then pixel art.

Thank you Ron Gilbert for finally finishing a chapter of my life with resolving ( if there is, I do not know still ) the secret of Monkey Island :-)

Will update after advancing more into the game :-)

I am thoroughly enjoying this game so far. I've been playing these games from the beginning. I started playing the newest one this morning, as soon as it launched on Steam. The art style is a bit jarring, if you are nostalgic for the old pixel art style, but I soon came to adore this new graphical style. If you're a fan of the originals, this one does not disappoint. My high expectations have been met and then some! I've made it to Part II, now, I'm off to play more Monkey Island...

It's Monkey Island, my all time favorite game. I am glad that even released.
I have played almost two hours, so not fully concluded yet. It's fun till now, it has the MI feeling for me, overall I am satisfied. Graphics/animation dont feel bad for me (neither said wow), but the feeling and fun matter for me. Thanks for keeping the franchise alive!

Monkey Island 1 was pretty much the first pc game i ever played back in the day like 1991 or 1992. its pretty much my most loved gaming franchise. at first i was sort of put off by the initial screenshots because of the art style. but now after having played it and seeing it in motion, its really really nice. 10x better than Broken Age. Great to have the characters back on a new adventure. and judging from the first hour and gilberts thimble weed park, this is going to be really good.
i've just been sitting in front of my pc the entire hour with a huge smile on my face (joker style). thanks to all involved for giving us what we have dreamed of for a long time!

So far so good!

I'm so excited for a new Monkey Island and it warms my heart seeing so many people playing it!
If you are a Monkey Island fan I definitely recommend it; unless something completely ruins it, I doubt I'm going to change my recommendation (I'll give an update in case that happens).

The artstyle felt a bit weird when the game was announced but I kept an open mind and now that I'm playing it, does it still feel weird? At first, maybe. After a while, it does grow on you.

In conclusion, I really love this series and that's why I might be slightly biased... but pressing that play button just made feel like a kid again, starting my journey to become a mighty pirate!

Putting this as somewhat of a placeholder for a more thorough review later on, but since I was smiling like a kid, whistling the soundtrack and getting the chills from just getting into the menu I'm gonna go ahead and give it a preliminary stamp of approval. :D This is the best thing to happen in a video game way for a couple of DECADES for me.

First impressions: I love the game already. Brilliant twist in Prologue. Fresh touch on the point-click interface. Pleasant game flow. Great mood: not sad nostalgia, but sunny holiday of the childhood (and we, grown up players, can feel it). Nice art and animations.

I haven't played very far, but after the first few minutes of gameplay you realize: This game is a genuine masterpiece. The intro/tutorial alone is pure genius, and it has all the wit of the first two parts. The graphics are impressive. I like them very much, and they go well with the overall style. As a player of the first two parts, I feel thirty years younger. And Guybrush has aged way better than I did. Go and buy it - it will make you smile the instant you get past the title screen.

A worthy successor to Monkey Island franchise.
Funny jokes, good story.

It is perfect. The art style is beautiful, the story seems perfect so far (completed Part 1 only so far)

If you're a fan or new to the series, you won't be disappointed

Game is fantastic so far. Love the updated interface. Nostalgia left and right. Exactly what this oldschool fan wanted. Thanks Ron and Dave.

So hear me out, stop complaining about the graphics: they look AMAZING.

The game plays and feels fresh, it is a joy to be back in Melee Island with all the characters we know and love. It is like coming back to a familiar place where everything is different but similar.

Dave and Ron have done an amazing job writing dialogues for this game. The characters are witty, funny and deep, each with their own backgrounds and interests, pulling the story to their side.

This game is a must buy for anyone over 30 who played the classics, but you sure know that already.

It is always an honor being able to spend more time with Guybrush, and this game, despite its more modern surface, FEELS like games of old. I hope we won't have to wait 13 years for another entry into the pirating point-and-click world.

It's fantastic, everything I wanted from a new MI Game. Bought part 1, 2 and 3 as they came out and I feel like I am a kid playing them again, really great, ignore the hate.

It's Monkey Island what more is there to say?
I wasn't sure about the art style from the trailers but it works really well imo! Turning off G-Sync resolved the render issues I had booting it up.

Ah the memories. The writing is fantastic, voice acting fantastic, comedy fantastic, and the game is polished. Art style has grown on me after about 10 minutes of playing. Been playing on the PC but can't wait to see if it loads up on the steam deck!

This game is a great return to a series near to a lot of our hearts. Love the new animation style, there's a lot of detail. Story so far is great. Voice acting is great as usual. Overall I'm really happy with this addition 10/10

Loving the art style. Navigation is easy and pleasant. Nostalgia is there, hitting in a big way. I have to stop myself from finishing all at once. I want this to last as long as possible

It's the real deal!

The art style scared me like everyone else, but once you start playing it, everything will clear out.

IT PLAYS LIKE A DREAM, controls are streamlined in a perfect way.

Masterpiece so far !! A real, true, new Monkey Island, what more would you ask for ? :)

And ignore the haters that were whining before the game even got released, the visuals are GREAT !

I love Monkey Island. All of them. Yes, even Escape and Tales. It's my favorite adventure game series, and I was thrilled when Return was announced.

Right off the bat, I have to address the art style, since it gave this game a lot of bad press. Well, it looks way better once you actually play the game. Every screen is colorful and vibrant, and it is a joy to watch and play.

Return is very accessible. There is a recap of previous games (ALL of them are canon), multitude of accessibility options, checklist of current tasks and even a hidden tutorial.

I'll update this review once I finish the game.

Played for about 10 mins, the charm is still there and its so refreshing to play another Monkey island game! I checked the text after making a certain wish and it made sense! That made my day. Thank you for making another! (And feel free to make more!)

The music, voice-acting, and new art style are spot on! I love the details and the time they took connect you to the previous games. It will really help with anyone looking to jump into this world for the first time. While I haven't finished the whole game at the time of writing this, I can say that I've really enjoyed the experience thus far. It's absolutely worth it to spend some of your hard earned pieces of eight on the game. Personally, I have to say, it really feels great to be back in the Monkey Island universe.

I'd also like to thank Ron Gilbert, Rex Grossman, and the entire Terrible Toybox dev team for putting in the work and making a Monkey Island game worthy of the title!

Not really a review, as I have barely played it, but I just wanted to quickly say that, despite what the Steam minimum requirements claim, this game seems to run just fine on my on-board Intel HD Graphics on Windows 10.

haven't played the game, just wanted to make sure I got my horse armor.

Cons: no pirate in the Scumm bar with an obvious sales pitch about Thimbleweed Park

It's been a long wait. Thank you Ron Gilbert and the team for bringing Guybrush back. The game is just lovely and I'm laughing so much already!

Oh, there's no "Enable 3D acceleration" menu ;)

Loving it. Seems to live up to the originals while hitting the sweet spot between nostalgia and creating something new. Incredibly huge step up from Thimbleweed Park.

Wasn't sure about the art style before but it really does look much better in motion.

Thanks, Ron!
