In the first level of this game I have:

-Fought a Metal Gear
-Threw said Metal Gear like a ragdoll
-Had my Prime Minister stolen by a fat bald man with a samurai sword
-Fought the same Metal Gear again
-Jumped from rocket to rocket during a rocket barrage
-Ran down a collapsing building towards the Metal Gear then cut it in half
-Ran down a train and jumped aboard it while wall running
-Had my ♥♥♥♥ rocked by a Brazilian man with a red samurai sword
-All of this while I listened to music that rivals DOOM

I love this game

STANDING HERE
I REALIZE
YOU ARE JUST LIKE ME
TRYING TO MAKE HISTORY
BUT WHO'S TO JUDGE
THE RIGHT FROM WRONG
WHEN OUR GUARD IS DOWN
I THINK WE'LL BOTH AGREE
THAT VIOLENCE BREEDS VIOLENCE
BUT IN THE END
IT HAS TO BE THIS WAY

HERE I STAND BENEATH THE WARM AND SOOTHING RAIN
THE DROPLETS FALLING GENTLY DOWN ON THE TERRAIN
WASH AWAY THE SORROW
ALL THE STAINS OF TIME
BUT THERES NO MEMORY
ITS ONLY DRY INSIDE

IN THE MUD AND SINKING DEEPER
INTO A PEACEFUL LIFE
AND IT WILL COME
LIKE A FLOOD OF PAIN
POURING DOWN ON ME
AND IT WILL NOT LET UP UNTIL THE END IS HERE
AND IT WILL COME
THROUGH THE DARKEST DAYS
IN MY FINAL HOUR
AND IT WILL NEVER REST UNTIL THE CLOUDS ARE CLEAR
UNTIL IT FINDS MY DREAMS HAVE DISAPPEARED

MEMORIES BROKEN, THE TRUTH GOES UNSPOKEN
I'VE EVEN FORGOTTEN MY NAME
I DON'T KNOW THE SEASON OR WHAT IS THE REASON
I'M STANDING HERE HOLDING MY BLADE
A DESOLATE PLACE (PLACE)
WITHOUT ANY TRACE (TRACE)
IT'S ONLY THE COLD WIND I FEEL
IT'S ME THAT I SPITE AS I STAND UP AND FIGHT
THE ONLY THING I KNOW FOR REAL
THERE WILL BE BLOOD (BLOOD) SHED (SHED)
THE MAN IN THE MIRROR NODS HIS HEAD
THE ONLY ONE (ONE) LEFT (LEFT)
WILL RIDE UPON THE DRAGON'S BACK
BECAUSE THE MOUNTAINS DON'T GIVE BACK WHAT THEY TAKE
OH NO, THERE WILL BE BLOOD (BLOOD) SHED (SHED)
IT'S THE ONLY THING I'VE EVER KNOWN
LOSING MY IDENTITY
WONDERING, "HAVE I GONE INSANE?"
TO FIND THE TRUTH IN FRONT OF ME I MUST CLIMB THIS MOUNTAIN RANGE
LOOKING DOWNWARD FROM THIS DEADLY HEIGHT AND NEVER REALIZING WHY I FIGHT

Memories broken, the truth goes unspoken
I've even forgotten my name
I don't know the season or what is the reason
I'm standing here holding my blade
A desolate place (place)
Without any trace (trace)
It's only the cold wind I feel
It's me that I spite as I stand up and fight
The only thing I know for real
There will be blood (blood) shed (shed)
The man in the mirror nods his head
The only one (one) left (left)
Will ride upon the dragon's back
Because the mountains don't give back what they take
Oh no, there will be blood (blood) shed (shed)
It's the only thing I've ever known
Losing my identity
Wondering, "Have I gone insane?"
To find the truth in front of me I must climb this mountain range
Looking downward from this deadly height and never realizing why I fight

Standing here
I realize
You are just like me
Trying to make history

But who’s to judge
The right from wrong?
When our guard is down
I think we’ll both agree

That violence breeds violence
But in the end it has to be this way

I’ve carved my own path
You followed your wrath
But maybe we’re both the same

The world has turned
And so many have burned
But nobody is to blame

Yet staring across this barren wasted land
I feel new life will be born
Beneath the blood stained sand
Beneath the blood stained sand

A Brief Introduction
The year is 2001. The anticipated sequel to the smash hit, Metal Gear Solid, has just been released. Immediately, outrage is sparked and the game becomes the bastard child of the franchise, for one primary reason:

The fans hated Raiden.

It’s been 21 years since then (Insane, right?), and where’s all the hate gone? People actually LIKE Raiden now? Why’s that?
This game is why, and here's why you should definitely get it.

In-Depth Analysis
Gameplay
Platinum Games, famously the creators of Bayonetta and Nier: Automata, are no strangers to fast-paced hack and slash games. In fact, they’re probably the best developers in the genre. When Kojima asked them to make a hack and slash game based in the Metal Gear universe with Raiden as the lead, they delivered in spades.

Gameplay is actually very simple. Unlike Bayonetta and Devil May Cry, where the player is buried in weapon types to switch in and out, MGR gives you a single sword and says “Go nuts kid.” You have light attacks, heavy attacks, and all the combos that gives you. Very easy to pick up, very easy to get into.

What makes the Metal Gear Rising stand out from the pack is its emphasis on parrying enemy attacks and using your high-frequency blade to cut through anything in your way, enemies included. A properly directed light attack in the direction of the enemy deflects their hit, preventing the player from taking what could potentially be crippling damage on higher difficulties. Considering there is no block button, and dodges are slow and unreliable, parrying is the only decent way to avoid taking damage. MGR did it before Sekiro made it cool, although it's not nearly as demanding in the timing as Sekiro was.

Equally, healing items are incredibly scarce, requiring players to utilize MGR's unique combat mechanic of “Zandatsu”. By either stunning or damaging an enemy enough, players can slice them open with blade mode and rip out their fuel cells, refilling his health to full. Knowing the proper time to slice n’ dice and having good precision in your moves is the key to success, and on Revengeance difficulty, it's often the only way to stay alive under the onslaught of enemies thrown at you.


Proper parry timing and precise aim is heavily rewarded, or even potentially mandatory on higher difficulties.

To further emphasize how beginner-friendly this game is, unlike some hack and slash games that give you no warning and expect you to memorize all enemy attack patterns to dodge, Metal Gear Rising gives you a fair chance to react to what’s coming, leaving it up to the player to respond. Parryable enemy attacks are indicated by a red flash in their eyes, while unblockable attacks (Usually grabs) are indicated by a yellow glow.

The gameplay is fast, engaging, and easy to get the hang of. The bosses also take full advantage of this system to deliver memorable battles that I still hold in high regard to this day.

The only iffy part of the gameplay loop is that, probably due to being a Metal Gear game, Platinum Games included an incredibly minimalist and half-baked stealth system. While Raiden can see enemies through walls, and can “backstab” them, he has no sneaking mechanics, or really any way to hide. At best, it's a way to take out a few enemies before you inevitably get spotted and the massive brawl breaks out. At least there’s not really a penalty for getting spotted, unlike in MGS; you can just chop them in half.

The game also has a high level of replayability. Although the story and setpieces don't change, the rating system pushes players to improve their performance throughout, and every new difficulty level can change the enemies one encounters in each area. On normal, the first fight of the game is just against a handful of soldiers. On Revengeance difficulty, you're immediately thrown against a Gekko mech, along with several dogs.

Story
This is a Metal Gear game. Those that have played the Metal Gear Solid series know what this means. To those that have not: This entire game is both a serious political commentary, and an absolute joke at the same time. The topics can often be very serious, such as terrorism fueling the war economy, creating jobs, and being unpleasantly good for a nation. This is true; World War 2 actually pulled the American economy out of the Great Depression.

But then the next minute, you have a cyborg ninja debating philosophy with a sentient robot dog, Raiden wearing a mariachi band outfit, and most famously, a terrorist declaring that “Memes are the DNA of the soul.”


Metal Gear Rising absolutely revels in how absurd it is at every opportunity, and it's fantastic. 
Community Created Artwork for Steam Artwork

On the surface, the combination of dead-realism and complete absurdity seems incompatible, but the game owns it by being acutely aware of how crazy it’s being, embracing it, and running wild with it. It’s the same writing logic that propelled Metal Gear Solid into being rated one of the best series of all time.

In the end, it creates an incredibly fun way of discussing genuinely serious topics, though sometimes the absurdity overshadows the horror of what’s happening in the moment.

However, this IS a canon part of the Metal Gear universe, meaning it makes numerous references to the events of the other games. If you haven’t played the other games, you won’t understand what people are saying every now and then, but thankfully the majority of the dialogue is self-contained within Rising, preventing too much confusion. If you’re one of those people that really loves their lore or needs context, I would heavily encourage you to play or watch the Metal Gear Solid series, as they are equally excellent games.

Visuals
The game looks great, plain and simple. The game is somewhat dated by today’s standards, having come out in 2013, so you don’t have to look hard to find some rough edges, unrefined models, and simplistic architecture. It makes up for this with good art and character design making them visually memorable and interesting. MGR especially loves its particle effects, so expect lots of those.


Metal Gear Rising has an excellent sense of cinematography and presentation.

Audio
Even the biggest detractors of Metal Gear Rising never deny one thing: The music in Rising is AWESOME. The intense electric metal perfectly suits the cybernetic themes of the game, and the boss themes are incredible, both lyrically and musically. “Rules of Nature” was the go-to edgy meme song before “Bury the Light” from DMC5 took its place 6 years later. In fact, you’ve probably heard Rules of Nature at some point if you haven’t been living under a rock since 2013. I still listen to the boss themes when working at my PC.

GeForce RTX 3050Ti 4GB | Intel i7 | 16GB | Windows 10
Obviously a game from 2013 better run on my specs, but it’s important to note it also ran perfectly fine on my old PC from 2013, which only had a GeForce 840m 2GB and 8 GB of RAM. Unless you’re still using your 2005 Windows XP PC held together with duct tape, you should be able to run this game on good settings with good frames.

A controller is HEAVILY recommended due to the precise omni-directional nature of the game. Keyboard and mouse parrying is so difficult in comparison that MGR was the sole reason I bought my first PC-compatible controller.

Conclusion
Very Highly Recommended
Metal Gear Rising isn’t necessarily a one-of-a-kind experience; you can get the same story from Metal Gear Solid, and the same general gameplay from any hack and slash. However, the combination of the two styles, great sense of visual design, amazing soundtrack, and ease of accessibility make it a worthwhile purchase for any gamer. It can drop down to less than $7 on sale, but it’s worth the full price.

Get it when you can!

Memories broken, the truth goes unspoken
I've even forgotten my name
I don't know the season or what is the reason
I'm standing here holding my blade
A desolate place (place)
Without any trace (trace)
It's only the cold wind I feel
It's me that I spite as I stand up and fight
The only thing I know for real
There will be blood (blood) shed (shed)
The man in the mirror nods his head
The only one (one) left (left)
Will ride upon the dragon's back
Because the mountains don't give back what they take
Oh no, there will be blood (blood) shed (shed)
It's the only thing I've ever known
Losing my identity
Wondering, "Have I gone insane?"
To find the truth in front of me I must climb this mountain range
Looking downward from this deadly height and never realizing why I fight

33 Year old Liberian white Twink stops Third-world-country-destabilizer and Child-Abducting Private military company with the power of incredible violence.

MY favorite part in the game is when you suffer a somatic symptom, get beat up by 2 normal ass cops, limp around for 7 minutes in Denver, and then unlock Devil Trigger after getting deadnamed by the Meme Man. What a fantastic experience.

Do NOT disarm the Sam, he will command grab you.

Official Lyrics:
Standing here
I realize
You are just like me
Trying to make history

But who's to judge
The right from wrong
When our guard is down
I think we'll both agree

That

Violence breeds violence
But in the end it has to be this way

I've carved my own path
You followed your wrath
But maybe we're both the same

The world has turned
And so many have burned
But nobody is to blame

Yet staring across this barren wasted land
I feel new life will be born
Beneath the blood stained sand
Beneath the blood stained sand

Senator Armstrong talked about an omelette.

I'm not really American so take this Vietnamese omelette recipe from google

1 chilli
2 spring onions
2 limes
60g smooth peanut butter
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp fish sauce
2 tsp rice vinegar
60ml water
4 British Lion eggs
200g raw king prawns
50g beansprouts
Bunch of mint
Bunch of coriander
Salt
Coconut oil

Start by slicing your chilli, spring onions and cut one of your limes into wedges.
Place all your red chillis in a bowl with your peanut butter, sugar, soy sauce, fish sauce, rice vinegar, the juice from your remaining lime and water. Give it all a good mix until you have a smooth sauce. Set aside until later.
Beat your British Lion eggs in a bowl with 2 tbsp water and a generous pinch of salt.
Heat a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add a teaspoon of coconut oil and, once melted, add your prawns. Fry for a minute on one side, then flip over.
Pour your egg mixture into the pan so it forms a thin, even layer. Turn up the heat and cook for a minute, sprinkling in the spring onions as you go.
When the surface of the egg is nearly firm, sprinkle in your bean sprouts and flip your omelette in half so that you have a lovely half moon.
Tip your omelette onto a plate and open up the middle. Fill it with a handful of coriander, mint and your remaining sliced chillis. Serve up with your dipping sauce and enjoy.

Look out for the British Lion mark on your eggs to guarantee that they’ve been produced to the highest standards of food safety. You can find them at your favourite supermarket.

PS. I think this recipe was made by americans so it might not taste good

Memories broken
The truth goes unspoken
I’ve even forgotten my name

I don’t know the season
Or what is the reason
I’m standing here holding my blade

A desolate place
Without any trace
It’s only the cold wind I feel

It’s me that I spite
As I stand up and fight
The only thing I know for real

There will be blood-shed
The man in the mirror nods his head

The only one left
Will ride upon the dragon’s back

Because the mountains don’t give back what they take
Oh no

Wondering have I gone insane
To find the truth in front of me
I must climb this mountain range
Looking downward from this deadly height
And never realizing why I fight

I've went through puberty atleast 4 times while playing this game.
The sheer amount of testosterone that is pumped from your monitor into your eyeballs is almost overwhelming.
The fact that I can play as a Liberian American cyborg ninja who wears sombreros and slices people at lightspeed means we've hit our peak as a species and no game can compare.

Buy this game if you love and respect yourself.

MEMORIES BROKEN
THE TRUTH GOES UNSPOKEN
I’VE EVEN FORGOTTEN MY NAME!

I DON’T KNOW THE SEASON
OR WHAT IS THE REASON
I’M STANDING HERE HOLDING MY BLADE!!

A DESOLATE PLACE
WITHOUT ANY TRACE
IT’S ONLY THE COLD WIND I FEEL!

IT’S ME THAT I SPITE
AS I STAND UP AND FIGHT
THE ONLY THING I KNOW FOR REAL

THERE WILL BE BLOOD-SHED!
THE MAN IN THE MIRROR NODS HIS HEAD

THE ONLY ONE LEFT
WILL RIDE UPON THE DRAGON’S BACK

BECAUSE THE MOUNTAINS DON’T GIVE BACK WHAT THEY TAKE
OH NO
THERE WILL BE BLOOD-SHED
IT’S THE ONLY THING I’VE EVER KNOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LOSING MY IDENTITY
WONDERING HAVE I GONE INSANE
TO FIND THE TRUTH IN FRONT OF ME
I MUST CLIMB THIS MOUNTAIN RANGE!
LOOKING DOWNWARD FROM THIS DEADLY HEIGHT
AND NEVER REALIZING WHY I FIGHT!!!!!!!!

There’s a saying I like: “One sword keeps another in the sheath.”
METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE is a hack-and-slash action game, contrasting significantly with the franchise’s slower-paced, stealth-focused gameplay. In the high-tech future of 2018, our fellow cyborg, Raiden, must get to the bottom of a conspiracy by causing violence, The Only Thing He Knows.

This is my normal. My nature.
At first glance, it looks about on par with other late-7th console generation games. Serviceable texture work, scenery and shading that’s occasionally on the bland side, but never ugly to look at. Environments are usually littered with destructible items. What visually sets this title apart are the extraordinarily well-done animations and particle effects, which help provide a spectacularly smooth experience, both in cutscenes and during gameplay.

For the PC port quality, trying to play it above 1080p resolution is a little annoying. One needs to use a fan-made patch to trick the game into running at the desired resolution, with the caveat that it causes minor UI corruption, and requires one to change the graphics settings on each boot. Full keyboard rebinding is possible, but a gamepad is recommended. Otherwise, I’m happy to report a steady and stable experience at 1440p 60hz, with a Ryzen 9 3900X, 32GB RAM, GeForce 1070Ti, Windows 10 Pro system.

RULES OF NATURE!

Yes, within the first 10 minutes, you kick the arse of a skyscraper-sized mecha. It only gets better from here. 
A Screenshot of METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE
By: A Tomato

Get ready for some bang-up electronic rock and metal music to headbang to. The tracks played during boss fights are the highlight of the soundtrack, yet all in-game music features a subtle variable mix that lets the also-impressive vocals kick in or fade out during pivotal moments of combat. Hardly any better music to chop up your foes to.

In fact, there’s nothing amiss in the sound department at all. Rich and appropriately-acted dialogue, with the villains providing all the ham and cheese you can ever ask for. Powerful and sharp sound effects to give excellent feedback on your combat moves and statuses. It’s all just top-notch, really.

All we're sayin' is... GIVE WAR A CHANCE!
Peace doesn’t last long in the world that is now dominated by cyborg-staffed private military contractors. The Prime-Minister of an unnamed African nation, for whom Raiden provides bodyguard protection, is kidnapped and then bloodily murdered by the head of the Winds of Destruction. The loss of an arm barely deters our hero; determined to find and punish the people responsible for the murder, Raiden and his contacts uncover a sinister plot to stir chaos for profits – in the process, unearthing dark truths about himself and his “fight for justice”.

This is a genuinely fun story to follow, of course thanks primarily to the colourful cast of excellent characters. Between the middle of the game and the finale, however, it tends to languish some due to the lack of meaningful conflict or development.

My sword is a tool of justice.
As one of your mission-control characters state, this isn’t a sneaking mission. Beyond token stealth elements, mastery of the combat loop and its mechanics is key to victory. Raiden himself has very few defensive options starting out: only a “ninja run” to deflect bullets while travelling rapidly, and a directional block - which can be upgraded to a powerful riposte if the player times the block just before the enemy’s attack connects. These blocks and ripostes, unfortunately, need precise movement inputs towards the attacking enemy, meaning there are times when Raiden misses the block and gets chopped.

A couple more criticisms about the core gameplay are that the camera is pretty poor and uncooperative. Locking onto enemies helps little when it has a tendency to look away from the action. Also, many controls are unexplained and left for the player to discover by trial-and-error, such as quick-firing sub-weapons.


Yes, there are setpieces with quick-time events, but none ever feel badly done. The action is awesome, and the timings are generous.

Otherwise, that’s really the extent of my gripes with METAL GEAR SOLID: REVENGEANCE. Combat is exceptionally fluid, with lots of varied combos to pull off by stringing sequences of light-and-heavy strikes, on the ground or in the air. Of course, the selling point of the game is Blade Mode. Raiden can temporarily slow down time, angle a precise swing (or fifty) of his blade, and slice apart weakened enemies to instantly kill and have a chance at refilling his own health and energy meters. With dramatic pauses for effect and a sweet “Dead on!” from Raiden, catharsis goes through the roof.

To aid in combat, players can make use of various “sub-weapons” like thrown grenades and rocket launchers, as the only means of ranged utility or offense. Cumbersome to use without proper preparation or the aforementioned quick-firing, but can help turn the tide in your favour when things go poorly.


Not once does it fail to feel satisfying to rip open an enemy and crush their nanopaste unit.

I want… more!
And sweet goodness, the bosses are AWESOME. Beyond testing your knowledge of the game systems like a proper video game boss would (albeit with a difficulty spike or two around the mid-game) – they’re also some of the most memorable individuals to grace my library of games. When the game isn’t throwing a solid variety of fodder and mini-boss enemies your way to hack into a thousand pieces, it’s having you battle single foes on equal terms, usually while grandiose setpieces and kickass music play out. Exploding refinery as a backdrop? That’s only in the first hour, and things only get crazier towards the end!

This is what happens when you bring a tool to a sword fight!
Players earn currency via combat and rank gradings, which can be used to purchase additional abilities and enhancements for Raiden. Word of advice: take the Defensive Offensive ASAP. It's a useful dodge move. You also unlock more items and upgrades as you progress through the story and perform certain feats.

A chunk of extra content can be gathered through the VR Missions. Taking place in abstract environments, players have a variety of tough challenges to complete that encompass basically every major gameplay element on show. Included in the Steam release are some 30 extra VR Missions, but 20 still have to be unlocked by accessing hidden terminals scattered throughout the campaign.

There will be BLOOD! SHED!
The main campaign clocks in at some eight to ten hours in length, on Hard difficulty. Repeat playthroughs are encouraged in order to unlock more weapons, have your skills tested on higher unlockable difficulties, and especially to find more collectibles. Due to space constraints, I’ll just state that there’s a lot to collect.

The PC version also includes a boss-rush mode, should you want to skip all that awesome combat and get straight to awesome 1v1 combat instead. Last but not least, two extra stories can be played, taking you through familiar territory as other major characters from this title. These, in turn, control almost entirely differently, but just as satisfying as Raiden. The DLC campaigns themselves are rather short, at just two to four hours apiece – and the stealthy character’s story drags on at the start – but are overall a great inclusion nonetheless. Thus, full completion can take well over 30 hours to attain – a great deal at the usual price.

But no matter how jagged your path is,
You always come back to the road.
When the dust of battle settles,
The war still rages within…
Supremely satisfying combat, great replayability and awesome presentation elevate METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE into a superb recommendation for all lightning-fast action players.

Raiden, get to the curator, Tomato’s Bag of Games! Do not miss out on great reviews, this time!

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is an awesome game. It is a third person action hack and slash game with some epic boss battles. You play as Raiden who is a cyborg ninja/human hybrid. The story begins with Raiden working security detail for the president of an African country, they are attacked by the Desperado (A private military company) and their leader Sundowner kills the president N’mani. You fight numerous bosses. I will avoid spoilers by giving the details of the story here.

Graphics:

The graphics in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance are pretty good. It doesn’t have the best looking textures but you won’t notice them unless you go really slow. The game is supposed to be played fast and you’re constantly fighting enemies to notice the texture anyways. Game seems to be locked at 60 fps so I wish it went higher. The game is optimized pretty well as I never dipped below 50 in fps throughout the game, even when a lot was going on screen, it ran very smooth. The game features one of the best looking cinematic cut scenes, I don’t usually take many screenshots in games but this game had me take over 600 screenshots throughout the gameplay. Though the cut scenes are locked at 30 fps for some reason, they’re nothing too annoying but it is definitely noticeable.

There’s the usual options in this game like texture filtering, antialiasing, shadow quality, motion blur etc. Graphics menu image can be seen below:

Sound:

This game features an epic sound track. The voice acting is pretty solid. The game features a fast paced heavy metal/rock soundtrack. Even though I am not a fan of this genre of music I thoroughly enjoyed the music. Basically the music really pumps you up, especially during boss battles, you have that high rush and energy going on with this sort of music.

Gameplay:

The gameplay of this game is amazing and one of the best hack and slash gameplay I’ve ever played. Raiden has a basic blade which he uses to slice up enemies, later down the game you gain additional weapons and even a new blade near the end of the game. Raiden can use light and heavy attacks by left and right clicking respectively. You can create a lot of combos using these attack combinations and even unlock new moves with the in-game currency. There’s a Parry move which can be used to block almost every attack in the game (though some attacks will still hurt Raiden, like the last boss battle’s MG Excelsus form). You have to hit the direction of the enemy and your light attack button at the same time to be able to successfully a parry an enemy attack. When an enemy attacks you they’ll have a red light go off in their eyes and this is your chance to parry. A good practice in parrying is your key to beating this game otherwise some of the bosses will have you raging. Successful parrying of an attack will block the enemies’ attack and an electric current can be seen as visual confirmation of a successful parry. When you’ve nearly killed an enemy you can also go into blade mode and try to hit the red box which prompts up on the enemy, upon successful hit on the box Raiden will rip out the enemy’s heart out and crush it with his bare hands, this will refill both his fuel cell energy bar and health bar. When you’ve almost killed an enemy you may also get a prompt in Japanese to attack in blade mode or a series of quick time event moves. A lot of boss battles will also make use of the QTE’s.

When you fight enemies you gain battle points which can later be spent on new weapons, health and fuel cell upgrades and new moves. New suits can also be bought some of which have different feature such as one of the suits can have Raiden carry more grenades etc. Later down the line Raiden gains “Jack the Ripper” mode which can be activated using the R key. When you’re in ripper mode Raiden will start to glow red and his attacks do much more damage and you can easily kill of even the super cyborg mechs with a few hits. There’s also a Nano paste pickup which basically an add-on which refills your health once the whole bar depletes. Having a few of these before boss battles can also be very handy. Raiden’s health upgrades can go up to 150% and the fuel cell upgrades can add four small additional mini bars.

The weapons/recovery menu could’ve used an upgrade as it’s kind of limited. Every time you want to change a weapon you must go through this weapon menu. This is not too troublesome for the health or main weapon but can be annoying if you switch your sub weapons a lot. Even though PC’s have enough buttons to assign every weapon their own button they still decided to use this dumbed down console version of the menu which is quite painful to use. Menu as seen below:

Raiden has plenty of abilities such as ninja run which is Raiden running super-fast with his sword out and he blocks bullets with his blade. Basically when someone shoots with guns you can use this to avoid getting hurt. Ninja run will also have Raiden auto jump over obstacles. You can also use this to harass enemies by moving in getting a few hits and then moving away though this method is not as effective as most of the enemies have a lot of HP and can take a long time to kill. There’s a sort of a dodge ability, when you press Z key, Raiden will attack enemy and sort of jump back, it’s not that useful, I mostly used parry throughout the game and found that to be much better. In addition to that Raiden has what is called a blade mode. It basically slows down the game and you can cut up an enemy into many pieces and you can accurately cut up the enemy or objects. When you are in blade mode you can adjust the angle of your blade and make horizontal, vertical or diagonal strikes and at the end of blade mode the enemy/object will be cut exactly in normal time as well. A short gameplay featuring combat, parrying and Ripper mode as well as blade mode can be found below:

For Steam Review purposes.


Every level has you follow a linear path and a bunch of enemies to kill. Leading up to a boss battle. There’s many types of enemies including military guys with guns and rocket launchers, ninjas with blades, heavy armed cyborgs, even cyborg hounds etc. You can hide in cardboard boxes, metal barrels just like other Metal gear games, which can be hilarious. When enemies detect you, you’ll hear the ah-so-familiar exclamation mark sound from other Metal gear games. You can also get stealth kills and do most missions via stealth as well by sneaking behind enemy and pressing F when the prompt comes up.

I played on normal mode, game is not that difficult, though, the last boss can be pretty hard to beat and frustrating, others were not so hard. The game doesn’t require too much time to beat, you can easily beat the game in less than 8 hours of gameplay in normal mode. VR modes unlocks are hidden throughout the levels and must be activated to unlocked in order to play.

Graphics: 7/10
Sound: 9/10
Gameplay: 10/10
Overall: 9/10

Conclusion:

This game is extremely fun and if you’re a Kojima fan or even a fan of action/hack and slash games, you’ll love this game. Awesome soundtrack which will keep you pumped up during intense boss battles, some of which can last up to 10 minutes. Make your way by slicing up everything that moves or go the stealth way and try to eliminate one enemy at a time. The game features awesome cinematics and an interesting story which will keep you hooked and plenty of Kojima humor. I’ll 100% recommend this game. I really hope more PlatinumGames’ games make it to the PC.

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
 

THE ONE PIECE IS REAL

Platinum's first game on PC: CHECK
First "Metal Gear" game on PC since 2003: CHECK
Extremely good port from japanese developers: CHECK
Insanely fast paced over the top action game: CHECK
High replayability: CHECK
One of the best boss fights among others videogames: FREAKING CHECK

No matter who you are, DMC fan, MGS fan, if you love videogames - you will definitely love this game too! It's super fun, super action-packed, super challenging. Just BUY IT! Tell Kamiya that we are not eating ♥♥♥♥, tell Konami that we are hungry for more Metal Gear games on PC, tell them, by buying it, that we are fully ready to support them no matter what. It just HAS TO BE THIS WAY GODAMIT!

Raiden paved the way for THICK ROBOT CHEEKS in video games. He walked so 2B could run, and there is not nearly enough recognition of this fact.

Incredibly fun game with great action, gameplay, and soundtrack. Beat it 3 times already.
Game story length is a bit short but can still last about ~7 hours in one playthrough.
Lots of fun gameplay mechanics too but certain ones can take a bit to get used to.
You can also use a sword cut nearly anything you want into 2,500+ pieces. Satisfying.
This game is highly recommended.

STANDING HERE, I REALIZE YOU WERE
JUST LIKE ME TRYING TO MAKE HISTORY.
BUT WHO'S TO JUDGE THE RIGHT FROM WRONG.
WHEN OUR GUARD IS DOWN I THINK WE'LL BOTH AGREE.
THAT VIOLENCE BREEDS VIOLENCE.
BUT IN THE END IT HAS TO BE THIS WAY.
I'VE CURVED MY OWN PATH, YOU'VE FOLLOWED YOUR WRATH;
BUT MAYBE WE'RE BOTH THE SAME.
THE WORLD HAS TURNED, AND SO MANY HAVE BURNED.
BUT NOBODY IS TO BLAME.
IT'S TEARING ACROSS THIS BARREN WASTED LAND.
I FEEL NEW LIFE COULD BE BORN BENEATH
THE BLOOD STAINED SAND.

Worth every cent. Bought it on steam sale, felt like I stole it. Best cyber ninja game you'll ever play. 9/10

It has Gray Fox costume. 11/10

HERE I STAND BENEATH THE WARM AND SOOTHING RAIN
THE DROPLETS FALLING GENTLY DOWN ON THE TERRAIN
WASH AWAY THE SORROW, ALL THE STAINS OF TIME
BUT THERE'S NO MEMORY, IT'S ONLY DRY INSIDE
IN THE MUD AND SINKING DEEPER INTO A PEACEFUL LIFE
AND IT WILL COME LIKE A FLOOD OF PAIN POURING DOWN ON ME
AND IT WILL NOT LET UP UNTIL THE END IS HERE
AND IT WILL COME THROUGH THE DARKEST DAY, IN MY FINAL HOUR
AND IT WILL NEVER REST UNTIL THE CLOUDS ARE CLEAR
UNTIL IT FINDS MY DREAMS HAVE DISAPPEARED
MY DREAMS DISAPPEAR

In this game you fight a building-sized mech and slice it into a thousand pieces with a katana while speakers blast awesomely ridiculous Heavy Metal.

This is what this game calls a prologue.

MEMORIES BROKEN
THE TRUTH GOES UNSPOKEN
I’VE EVEN FORGOTTEN MY NAME

I DON’T KNOW THE SEASON
OR WHAT IS THE REASON
I’M STANDING HERE HOLDING MY BLADE

A DESOLATE PLACE
WITHOUT ANY TRACE
IT’S ONLY THE COLD WIND I FEEL

IT’S ME THAT I SPITE
AS I STAND UP AND FIGHT
THE ONLY THING I KNOW FOR REAL

THERE WILL BE BLOOD-SHED
THE MAN IN THE MIRROR NODS HIS HEAD

THE ONLY ONE LEFT
WILL RIDE UPON THE DRAGON’S BACK

BECAUSE THE MOUNTAINS DON’T GIVE BACK WHAT THEY TAKE
OH NO
THERE WILL BE BLOOD-SHED
IT’S THE ONLY THING I’VE EVER KNOWN
LOSING MY IDENTITY
WONDERING HAVE I GONE INSANE
TO FIND THE TRUTH IN FRONT OF ME
I MUST CLIMB THIS MOUNTAIN RANGE
LOOKING DOWNWARD FROM THIS DEADLY HEIGHT
AND NEVER REALIZING WHY I FIGHT

I have a dream. That one day every person in this nation will control their own destiny. A nation of the truly free, dammit. A nation of action, not words, ruled by strength, not committee! Where the law changes to suit the individual, not the other way around. Where power and justice are back where they belong: in the hands of the people! Where every man is free to think - to act - for himself! ♥♥♥♥ all these limp-♥♥♥♥ lawyers and chickenshit bureaucrats. ♥♥♥♥ this 24-hour Internet spew of trivia and celebrity ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! ♥♥♥♥ American pride! ♥♥♥♥ the media! ♥♥♥♥ ALL OF IT! America is diseased. Rotten to the core. There's no saving it - we need to pull it out by the roots. Wipe the slate clean. BURN IT DOWN! And from the ashes, a new America will be born. Evolved, but untamed! The weak will be purged and the strongest will thrive - free to live as they see fit, they'll make America great again!... In my new America, people will die and kill for what they BELIEVE! Not for money. not for oil! Not for what they're told is right. Every man will be free to fight his own wars!

Fun fact: you can buy metal gear solid 1 and 2 over on GOG and they run fairly well with some easy to install community patches. that being said:

So Raiden stops a Metal Gear armored with a 30m long sword with his small sword, grabs the metal gear, THROWS it into the air and splits it wide open while the fantastic OST perfectly kicks in


And this is just the damn tutorial

How to make the MOTHER OF ALL OMELETTES: (inspired by Red3Speed)

1.
Use two or three eggs per omelette. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.
Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn’t get too brown or overcooked.

2.
Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.

3.
Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.

The Metal Gear series offers a gameplay based mostly on privacy to the player, but the side game of the series MGR: REVENGEANCE, unlike the main games of the series, does not offer privacy, but a faster and more action-packed gameplay, bringing a solid Hack and slash game to the handle. Although it definitely lags far behind in terms of story against the main games of the series, it has a special place for me in the series with its pleasant story and satisfying gameplay in its own way. First of all, the game's story shows Raiden's battle against a group called Desperado after the events of MGS4 Guns of the Patriots. My favorite feature characters of the story, especially the characters in this story are great characters with a different personality, and it's not a masterpiece but the designs increased the pleasure of the game to be interesting for me too. Apart from the overall design of the bosses, they also add fun to the fun of the game as a battle. As for the music, the music that really makes you gas while playing was the music that I added to my existing spotify list. As someone who has played the entire MGS series, this was the last Metal Gear game I played, of course, I have no intention of playing the disgrace of Metal Gear Survival.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a collaborative effort between Platinum Games and Hideo Kojima.

What we’re left with is an extremely fast-paced hack and slash title set in the Metal Gear universe. Solid Snake fans will immediately be disappointed as you once again play as the ninja cyborg; Raiden.

The highlights of the game are the fast-paced combat, the stunning visuals, and the ridiculous boss fights. MGSRR does a great job with their combat system which is designed to keep you on the offensive while you chain together parries and attacks without the over-reliance on dodging.

The game also adds a “slice anywhere” mechanic which allows you to cut wherever you aim. This essentially allows you to cut enemies and objects in the environment into a million pieces. This really doesn’t add anything significant to the gameplay but it’s still quite a bit of fun.

The graphics, visuals, and environments are great. It’s a treat to watch the explosions and chaos unfold around you as you move from one varied area to the next. Unfortunately, the game is fairly linear and doesn’t allow for much room for exploration as you’re constantly hit with frustrating blue boundaries.

The game features an over the top story with plenty of humor mixed in. It’s entertaining but don’t expect the same level of depth as other Metal Gear Games.

The inclusion of VR missions, where you have to complete simple objectives in a virtual reality training program add a bit more content. The main game is very short however, clocking in at around 5 hours. Granted it’s a fun-filled 5 hours as the game features some of the best boss fights on the market.

A few extra things to note:
A controller is recommended for the game.
This is a console port. It does look better on the PC than the Xbox 360 and PS3 but it is capped at 1920 x 1080 resolution. This means if you're using a 2560 x 1440 resolution monitor, you won't be able to run it at that resolution, you'll have to downscale to 1080p.

For a more in-depth review, here’s a video I made:

By: [AReV]Nomed
Our Analog Review of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance by Senior Editor Nathan. Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is a collaborative effort between Platinum Games (Original Devil May Cry creators) and Hideo Kojima.


Pros:
Amazing gameplay
Stunning Visuals

Can cut things up into a million pieces

Cons:
Short Length and a lack of content in general
Linear with a lack of exploration
Story isn't up to par with other Metal Gear games.

I've cut a car into a thousand pieces in 3 seconds. 11/10 GOTY!

Just kidding of course. This stupid and pathetic type of reviews are killing me. If you can't write a few decent sentences about a game - why bother ? But enough about it, let's talk about the game.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is the hack-and-slash spinoff of the Metal Gear series, and a damn good one. Absolutely no Metal Gear knowledge or experience is required. You get to play as Raiden - a half-human, half-cyborg ninja through a 10-15 hour single-player campaign. After completing it you also get two bonus mini campaigns where you can play as Jetstream Sam & Blade Wolf, each of them having their own features. But that's not all. There are also a lot of VR missions to unlock in the main story as well as in the secondary ones, which you can play later at any time.

MGR:R has a good story accompanied by a great soundtrack. Although not exactly my type of music (metal rock), it fits entirely the game's atmosphere. The game is locked at 60 fps, but that's fine with me. It has a great art design and good visuals. Still, the best part is the combat and the gameplay itself. There are some stealth features available which were imported from the Metal Gear series, like barrels and boxes you can use to hide from enemies or sneak through undetected, but don't get fooled by that, this is not a stealth game by far, on the contrary - it's a "go on rampage" type. There are many different types of enemies, and you can cut each one of them in as many pieces as you want and also finish them with some nice looking finishing moves, including stealing the life source from their cyborg equipments. MGR: Revengeance is also very rewarding. There is a in-game currency which you can earn and use it to unlock new skills, well designed weapons which can also be improved, as well as extending your health and energy bar, and acquiring new costumes for your character, including my favourite - the Mariachi one. For some reason, slaughtering cyborgs wearing a Sombrero felt a lot better ^_^ Btw, I almost forgot to mention the amazing boss fights. I won't describe anything about it so i don't have to include any spoilers, but they are quite memorable. You'll see that for yourself.

I recommend Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance without any doubt, and i assure you it is worth every penny from its full price. If you're into hack-and-slash or fast-paced games - this would be one of the best choices you could make.

If you like games like Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, or God of War, you'll be right at home with this game.

Most gamers will probably know what the Metal Gear series is all about before going into this game. If you count yourself among these people, then try to forget what you know about Metal Gear. This game stands alongside other games in the franchise, but it is worlds apart in gameplay and tone. Metal Gear Solid games are primarily about stealth and story. Revengeance is about action, plain and simple.

The gameplay is phenomenal. Platinum has a gift with the Hack N' Slash genre and it shows with Rising. The combat is fluid and challenging while still being fun and accessible. The parry mechanic feature heavily in the game and while it may take some time to master for some, it's incredibly satisfying when you pull off a perfect parry and counter-attack an enemy for extra damage. There are certain fights that require you to have a decent handle of the move as well, and if you don't the game will help you out by beating it into you.

What's truly revolutionary is the parry/dodge mechanic in the game. Rather than having a dedicated block button, Revengeance makes it a forward+attack input, which maintains offensive momentum. You need to parry every attack coming at you, but the game's window is generous, allowing for a lot of wiggle room until you nail down your timing. And once you nail down that timing? You get perfect parries with counterattacks that lead into Zandatsu (slowdown cutting mechanic where you can steal energy cores).

Even if you don't get the combat, or you're an action game novice, the game features a number of different difficulty levels to tailor the experience to what is most comfortable for you as a player.

The story is filled with its own levels of abrudity, but features a memorable cast and set of bosses. The bosses... Oh, the bosses. They're some of the best of this entire generation- meticulously crafted and exhilarating to fight.

This game is seriously good, one of the best I've played. If you're a Metal Gear fan (who isn't busy whining that Snake isn't playable), a hack and slash fan, or someone who just likes fun, check this out. You won't be disappointed.

I.... I don't think I've had this much fun in a videogame in a long time, the gameplay and story work together so well.

What I'd give for a remake or a remaster to just iron out some kinks and improve the graphics.

My only complaint is that RAIDEN IS NOT WEARING HIS DAMNED PONCHO I BOUGHT HIM IN THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CUTSCENES REEEEEEE I NEED MORE RACIST RAIDEN!

A fast action game with solid game play music and decent story with the metal gear charm where stealth isn't the dominant game play but will be required at higher-level difficulties. This is a side story game where you play as the bad ass ninja Raiden, After a short intro on the execution of a country's minister by Desperado, you'll be taken forward in time to the point where Raiden will go after the armed coup that Desperatdo started to find out what is going on and what the private service companies are up to.
The Gameplay is pure action, Slicing, cutting, ripping, and cutting things your way, There will be side weapons you'll earn as you defeat bosses in the game with precise cuts with the katana. the game play slashing and slicing don't as just one-button presses, depending on where you aim and how you slice you can chop your enemies up to pieces. You'll want to chop their hands and certain places to take their spine so you can take it in as health when you need it and of course when this happens, free form blade mode time slows down enough for you to aim at your enemies on those precision cuts. Later in the game, you'll be able to do ripper mode where you'll go into overdrive. Sub weapons and extra items you can carry and use in this game, which are literally almost useless at times except for specific enemies and at higher end play.

The control for this game is better off played with a controller over a mouse and keyboard which was much easier personally to me for this type of game, though that is a preference, there will be intense fights where the key is to actually be on point for the attacks otherwise you're going to get yourself killed.
The soundtrack is absolutely rocking in this game, the music is big time adrenaline pumping, and you'll love it along with the funny voice overs. Ah yes the famous metal gear voice overs. Basically if you don't know what I am talking about you been missing out. It is hilariously bad at times but still well done for being bad, and that's what makes the game great.
Once you beat multiple hard modes, there is an even harder mode where you are required to sneak and kill your enemies and to challenge your skills to the limit, don't believe that the stealth is the best part of this game though and only at the highest level difficulty will you be forced to use it.

+ The unique system of cutting your enemies up, and things around you
+ Rockin soundtracks during battles and game play
+ Good variety of weapons that will be unlocked as you defeat bosses.
+ funny comedic moments
+ all the boss fight was intense and purely epic, especially the last boss
+ You slice lots of things to pieces, just not the watermelon
+ the way the battle is done is fluid, really fast paced action and the game play is smooth.
+ love the fps and the graphics upgrade as much as we got out of it, game runs super smooth
+ game is plain fun, FUN!
+ raiden is bad ass and you'll feel immersed enough that YOU are the bad ass

+- its a spin off and it isn't a regular metal gear game, fans looking for solid sneaking game will be really disappointed.

- The sub item isn't that useful at times, only for certain enemies.
- Things do disappear as you slice them
- The extra item you get is meh
- The stealth isn't metal gear quality
- Short game five hours long, you can, however, replay it on a harder difficulty, otherwise no online play or any other replayability factor, maybe some achievements.
- The map is straightforward. This is a linear action game with short side quest to do and hidden items to find.
- If only it was made on the PC graphics would have been crazy, but it is a port and improved one at that
- took a year to come out on pc man but the price is reasonable and with all dlc +++
- lol the voice acting is if you like it or hate it, it was done the way it is done.

I hope there is a sequel, and I hope they improve on adding more to it to make it unique, trust platinum games when it comes to making action game, this was a collaborative effort, and it was done well, if you played their games before you enjoy it, hardcore mgs fans who want to indulge in the mgs universe will either like or hate this, and those who crave action games will love this game, worth the purchase and also my gotm (game of the month) at the time when it came out.

So like one second you're in a limo with the prime minister of Africa, then some dude ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blocks bullets with his katana, slices a guy in half and tries to kidnap the prime minister and then you kill Cyborg ninjas and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Metal Gear shows up out of nowhere and you slice that thing's hand off, then it comes back, you slice the other hand off and then you split the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing in half with your katana while running down a collapsing building.

That's basically the first 20 minutes of the game.

I would say that, besides a sometimes whimsical camera (on which one of the main mechanics, the parrying system, depends), a lifespan just a tiny little bit too short, and too many QTEs (even if their inputs make sense, for example the grab counter QTE requires a gamepad user to jam the ♥♥♥♥ out of their left stick which is both tedious and unreliable), this game is PERFECT.

If videogames aren't fun to you anymore, try this one. MGR:R is the DEFINITION of a fun game.
When a game makes you feel like the embodiment of badassness to a rad soundtrack while simultaneously busying your mind with existential questions, you know your money's well spent.

Positive
Extremely rewarding combat - No roll-Button, no Block-Button. Feels like you have to parry like in a street fighter game all the time. When you finally got the hang of it, countering the enemy feels extremly rewarding.
Amazing staged boss encounters
Combat feeling reminds a bit of a hightech Bayonetta combined with arkham city fighting
Makes you feel like a badass.

Negative
Story could be more concentrated for my taste. Not every level feels like it NEEDS to be there.
Learning the combat system is difficult at first since it works differently than others from this gerne (Parrying). So expect to get your ass handed to you until you get hang of it.
Graphics are a bit too much grey in grey. Good models though.

Most important advice
Red light from the enemy means press in his direction and attack to block. Just like in the recent batman games blocking is more important than attacking.

Buy this game?
Absolutely! Personally i wouldn't pay more than 15 bucks for it but even for my alltime favorites i wouldn't pay more than 30.

In the first installment of the "Rising" series of the Metal Gear franchise, cyborg super-soldier Raiden is dispatched on a mission against a private military company held responsible for acts of terrorism. The truth happens to be more than that in the end.

The famous (or infamous) spin-off from the original Metal Gear Solid series, Revengeance brings a gameplay shift from the usual stealth third person shooter into an action-packed hack-and-slash sword fighting game. With Raiden's main weapon being the high-frequency blade, the player is put to engage several enemies that vary from regular sword-fighters, to rocket-launching cyborg soldiers, to huge assault mechs.

Gameplay

As mentioned above, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance has mainly action gameplay. Implementing the occasional use of one of its main game mechanics, the "Zandatsu" (lit. 'cut and take'), used to slice off foes and extract energy units to replenish your own. Stealth is present in the game, as you can sneak past or stealth-kill a number of enemies, but at little quantity given the action genre of the game.

Sided with Zandatsu comes the parrying game mechanic, which will give you an extra edge (no pun intended) on combat given its often prompt to deal finishing Zandatsu attacks upon a 'perfect' parry. It's also the only method of defense that doesn't involve dodging in the game, making it your incentive to master it.
(Note: it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED you have a controller of some sort to play this game, as mouse and keyboard gameplay is extremely complicated.)

Combat in the game feels pressing and complicated at higher difficulty levels, giving an extra challenge on levels Hard and above. In addition, there is the presence of some quick-time events, as well as boss fights of the game which usually feel absolutely riveting, from fast-paced cyborg vs. cyborg combat to slicing off pieces of humongous mechs.

The only down side is an arena-style limited area during fights.

Plot

The story begins in a recently-enforced African country, introducing Raiden as now a member of private military corporation 'Maverick Security Consulting Inc.'. During a guard duty task, President N'mani is hijacked and killed by military contractors of Desperado Enforcement LLC. Months later, Raiden is deployed in tasks to investigate terrorist activities found out to be backed by Desperado. It happens though, it's more than just power and money at play as Raiden uncovers a bigger scheme.

The story is over-the-top and characters are -on the least- quirky. Not that it's a bad thing, and it gives the game its distinction from Metal Gear Solid franchise. Just get ready for cyborg ninja fights and explosions.

Soundtrack

Lead composer Jamie Christopherson did an amazing job with the soundtrack of Revengeance, both in the less-famous ambient music and in the better-known vocal tracks, perfectly fitting the situations and characters involved in the longest time. It sets the mood and gives the finishing touch of the game, being also one of the highlights of the game.

Bugs

Little if any that I know of or could see.

Overall

Albeit opinions vary, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance surely does good work in the fighting/action game genre, even if breaking somewhat from the known Metal Gear Solid formula.Revengeance being my first Metal Gear game, in my opinion it's a game worth a play and should be taken in consideration.

Review

Hideo Kojima had a vision of transfiguring a solid tactical espionage title into a rising lightning bolt action game; from here, Metal Gear Solid Rising was born. It began as a slow-paced, hack-and-slash game following the route of its predecessors, combining swordsmanship with spectral gameplay. By utilizing the Fox Engine, the cardinal objective was to create a game that swings between being stealthy and action-oriented. To focus on other projects, Kojima made a wrong call by leaving the game's development process to his team.

Without his guidance, Hideo's team was lost, since they were struggling to balance the preconceived slashing mechanics with the level design of the game. Luckily, a company that is well-known for engineering fast-paced games handled the project, hence saving it from its demise. Abandoning the Fox Engine, PlatinumGames utilized its own game engine to integrate the Metal Gear universe into a trailblazing, brief game. The resultant of all this is Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, an excellent game that had a rocky development, yet surpassed our expectations with honors.

It's laughable to picture a casual player booting up the game, thinking it would have mercy on a new soul, and then his first fight is with a 20 meters tall versatile UG. The main story is weaved to be very engaging thanks to the nonplus twists that radically alter the plot from being ordinary to being pre-eminent. The overall character design of MGR is its mystic quartz. Raiden is made into a badass by amplifying his cybernetical, charismatic, and psychological attributes. Bosses, who sporadically appear in the ordinary game's events, will be the glimmering stars of the show thanks to their eccentric mien and distinctive battles.

Fitting soundtracks that correlate with each one of them play a crucial role in their appeal. The boss battles are the pinnacles where MGR's combat style will glister. They are programmed using the concept of the RNG algorithm, which means that memorizing their attack patterns won't be very helpful here. I will never forget this battle with the fierce demagogue; it will be a memory in my heart when we both said, "This is the greatest fight of my life!" concomitantly while an epic song was playing in the background.

The camera has issues that dreadfully impact controlling Raiden in combat. The lack of a FOV dilating option in the graphics menu makes matters even worse. It's tormenting to strive for the no damage bonus in a ranked battle when a cheapass enemy can easily strike you with a charged attack which was commenced off camera. The best way to circumvent this problem in boss fights is to lock-on the boss so for the camera to be focused on him. Sadly, this option is useless in battles that have multiple enemies attacking you.

What makes the story's content so chirpy is that it demonstrates serious matters and does something out of the box to imply that it doesn't take itself that seriously. The dialogue within the copious codec conversations has adequate data that renders NPCs' personalities quite well. The intervention of amusing moments in solemnly themed sceneries is exhibited wonderfully; this supplements the premium quality of the sceneries that is a vital property for reinvigorating the story aspect and its elucidation.

Being a Platinum game, the prime focus of MGR is encouraging direct encounters with enemies. Furtive gameplay is notably dispirited by substandard stealth mechanics and lesser BP points. There are 3 weapon categories in the game: primary blades, unique weapons acquired from fallen bosses, and secondary weapons. All the previously mentioned weapons are quite useful in the specific circumstances they are designed for. A judicious combination of attacks orchestrated from them can be devastating, hence ending a battle that could've lasted 8 minutes in 20 seconds, especially in the highest difficulty.

In MGR, QTEs are adroitly concatenated within combat. Jacked animations executed while a first-rate soundtrack is playing in the background are guaranteed to initiate some goosebumps. QTEs in Revengeance mode are the ultimate win, as they do a significant amount of damage in boss confrontations. Blade mode, the transmuting feature that MGS:R was going to be based on, puts the player into slow-motion where he can perform a 斬奪, which is a special technique used by Raiden, to extract electrolytes from enemies to replenish his fuel cells and health.

The controls in this game are well-suited for a controller; they are vexing when using a keyboard and mouse. Exempli Gratia: when a f*cking mastiff grabs Raiden's ass around, the player is prompt to rotate the controller's analog in circles to evade the grab; to match this using a keyboard, the player must press W, A, S, D simultaneously in supersonic speed to cope with the responses of an analog rotating—it's very strenuous to do so. Using the evade technique with a keyboard is quite hard in certain fights when the direction of the evade is essential in a fight.

Let's not ignore the elephant in the room, shall we? The VR missions in MGR stands for violating rectum missions. They are programmed for the sole purpose of infuriating the player. After achieving the highest score in the total of 50 VR missions available, I felt ashamed for the amount of time I've wasted on these cheap challenges. They came too close to ruining the entire game for me. I won't cover all of their issues, but I will mention a few of them. First of all, their map design is nauseating. They take place in a bland yellow environment that lacks anything interesting.

The prime concept of these missions is trial and error. The player must try a challenge like 25 to 100 times based on his luck for the one time when all the positive factors align together to make setting the highest score achievable. Let's take VR mission 17 for example: in this mission, the player must destroy waves of aggressive enemies using sub-weapons. For starters, the rocket launcher's mechanics are slow as hell, and it's mainly useful to take down choppers. The player can use the quickfire technique, but sadly, he is in no control of where the shots are fired, as it's up to the rocket launcher to choose for him.

DL-VR mission 27 wins the prize for being the Brobdingnagian pain in the ass. It's very hard and has a flawed design. The player is at the mercy of the merciless AI. The problem with this map is that at the final round, one of the 4 fenrirs will comet suicide by jumping off the map or exploding, which shatters the chance for a 斬奪, hence rendering all the hard effort to get to this exasperating round pointless. The overall performance of the game is decent. I didn't encounter any problems, lags, or crashes. The maximum resolution of the game is 1920x1080, and aspect ratios other than 16:9 are anamorphic. Also, the game doesn't support 4K resolution properly.

> Verdict:

To Hideo Kojima: you never cease to amaze!
To PlatinumGames: keep up the adrenaline doses!
To Senator Armstrong: you made this game enthralling. I will never forget you.
To VR missions designers: I hope you all go bankrupt as soon as possible.

Born
Into a pack
There’s no choice
But take orders to attack

Locked up in chains
I get fed
But the hunger still remains

Not content to live this way
Being led by the blind
Got to plan my dispersal
Time to leave them all behind

Breaking out of my pain
Nothing ventured – nothing gained
I’m my own master now

Bear the mark of my scars
Shedding blood underneath the stars
But I will survive somehow

Oooooooo
Oooooooo

Hear me howl
Time to leave them all behind
I’m my own master now

Memories broken
The truth goes unspoken
I’ve even forgotten my name

I don’t know the season
Or what is the reason
I’m standing here holding my blade

A desolate place
Without any trace
It’s only the cold wind I feel

It’s me that I spite
As I stand up and fight
The only thing I know for real

There will be bloodshed
The man in the mirror nods his head

The only one left
Will ride upon the dragon’s back

Because the mountains don’t give back what they take
Oh no
There will be bloodshed
It’s the only thing I’ve ever known

Losing my identity
Wondering have I gone insane
To find the truth in front of me
I must climb this mountain range
Looking downward from this deadly height
And never realizing why I fight

Looks like I finally found the best video game character of all time, all hail ✧ JETSTREAM SAM ✧

Alright first off I wanna say that this game doesn't do a very good job of explaining how parrying works so i will quote a helpful statement which i found - "you have to rapidly use analog & atk button AT THE SAME TIME, meaning after a parry you'll have to press analog & atk button again to re-activate parry, holding the analog and press atk button alone won't activate parry." I found about this very late in the game but after finally mastering parrying the combat became more orgasmic, its literally so good that i cant suppress the urge to replay it on hard to wreck the bosses more properly this time around. The cutscenes are extremely over-the-top and goosebumps inducing moreover some scenes possesses great meme potential as expected of platinum games, they also blessed us with 2 DLCs in which we can play as Blade Wolf and ma boi ✧ JETSTREAM SAM ✧ the best one no brainer.

-Gameplay-
🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it
🔲 Easy
☑️ Normal
🔲 Hard
🔲 "Dark Souls"

On most difficulties, this game is a pretty fair game, even on some of the harder difficulties. The game gives you plenty of upgrade choices for you to be able to prepare yourself for higher difficulty runs. However, the hardest difficulty in the game, Revengeance difficulty, will NOT hold back. It is a good test of your strength of how far you've come. If you've prepared well for it, then you can put up a good fight with the skills you've learned along the way, but the final boss will still make you struggle a fair amount before he lets you pass him on this difficulty.
DLC: The first of these two DLCs however is HARD. You will struggle on even some of the easier difficulties.


-Graphics-
🔲 "MS Paint"
🔲 Bad
🔲 Meh
🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game
☑️ Good
🔲 Beautiful
🔲 Masterpiece

This game is a 2013 game, so of course you shouldn't be expecting anything too fancy. However, it's aged pretty well, despite the couple of pre-rendered cutscenes this game has have a JARRING contrast to the gameplay part, but doesn't diminish anything.


-Story-
🔲 This game has no story
🔲 Like playing "Temple Runners" for the story
🔲 It's there for the people who want it
🔲 Well written
☑️ Epic story

This is a Metal Gear game, a series that is known heavily for its deep and meaningful stories that at times even predict the future in classic Kojima fashion. However, this game did not have the series creator, Hideo Kojima, apart of its creation. Despite this, this game hits all the marks perfectly for a Metal Gear game, and so well in fact, you probably wouldn't know he wasn't apart of it. It's not one of the more deeper games of the series (while still having some depth), but it most certainly has strong meaning to it, and yes, great future predictions that have aged VERY well in funny ways.


-Music-
🔲 Bad
🔲 Not special
🔲 Good
☑️ Beautiful

This game's music is absolutely phenomenal. The rock is great and fuels the gameplay perfectly with how much the music flows through you. Don't believe me? You can turn the music completely off in the settings. Try playing any boss fight without music and it'll hurt and be an extremely missed aspect with how much it works in tandem with the game.


-Length-
🔲 Very short (0 - 3 hours)
☑️ Short (3 - 15 hours)
🔲 Average (15 - 50 hours)
🔲 Long (50 - 90 hours)
🔲 Extremely long (90 - 110 hours)
🔲 No ending

The length. This game can be completed in about 5-6 hours depending how fast you get the controls down and what difficulty you're playing on. This is one of those games where its biggest problem really is that it is just too short. You'll want more, yet because of how Konami has been after this game's release, it isn't very likely that we'll see a sequel, even though the series creator, Hideo Kojima, praised Platinum's work on this game, and the person who was behind this game is still working at Konami.
DLC: There are two DLCs, but they are basically just two semi-longer missions for you to play afterwords.


-Fun-
🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry
🔲 Hard to enjoy
🔲 Repetitive
🔲 Actually pretty amusing
☑️ Ride of your life

This game really is a joyride of an experience. Despite this game being apart of a notoriously "where should I start" series, this game actually takes place after the whole Metal Gear Solid saga. Therefore, while you would of course get more enjoyment out of this game with knowledge on the series, this can be enjoyed even as outsider to the series. Think of the Metal Gear Solid saga as Marvel's Infinity Saga and this game is the start of what's next to come.
Once you learn how to play well and unlock more and more upgrades, you will just get more joy going on and on with the strength you can feel your character get when playing.


-Price-
🔲 Free
🔲 Underpriced
🔲 Perfect price
☑️ Could be cheaper
🔲 Overpriced
🔲 Complete waste of money

$30 is not a bad price for this game, especially with how many positive points this game has. However, the length of it really is the game's most jarring flaw. If you can find this on sale for $20, don't hesitate.


-Replayability-
🔲 It's a one - time experience
🔲 Only for achievements
🔲 If you wait a few months / years
🔲 Definitely
☑️ Infinitely replayable

There are so many upgrades in this game, some helpful, some just fun outfits to wear for a different experience. You have a decent amount of collectibles and even extra mini-missions you can always go back to in order to unlock more extra things. And even once you get all the collectibles and missions, it's still so fun to just go through the story again (and this time, probably a beast with all your upgrades) just for the fun of it.


-Requirements-
☑️ You can run it on a microwave
🔲 Average
🔲 High end
🔲 "NASA" computer

This is a 2013 game for the Xbox 360 and PS3, so of course, it's not very hard to play this. However, this game plays a little better with a controller. It's not bad on keyboard and mouse, but because of how fluid some game movements are, a controller is just the king of course at times.


-Worth buying?-
🔲 No
☑️ Wait for sale
🔲 Yes


Final Notes: Let this meme be passed down.

To parry, press light attack and tap the stick toward the enemy after they flash red. It will block an attack, or, if you time it just right, Raiden will hit the enemy with a powerful counter-attack.

You'll also want to buy the Defensive Offense skill so you can dodge yellow grab attacks and missiles.

Now go and let her rip!!

The only game where you can:
-Fight a robot dog with a Chainsaw it can swing around and attached to its back
-Fight a woman with 10 arms
-Make friends with the robot dog you fought
-See children's brains
-Cut a child hostage in half
-Kill brutal police and then feel bad about it after listening to their thoughts
-Kill a crazy version of Magneto from XMen
-Kill a guy with a Texan accent with shields that explode if you hit them
-And Kill a US Senator who literally says Make America Great Again and has super powers because he has Nanomachines...

Alrighty listen up, when it comes to character actions games, you got 3 categories.

You got the nothing special games, your dante's infernos, your DMC1's, etc.

You got the Damn good ones, God of war, DMC 4, Bayonetta 1, etc

And then you got the big boys, DMC 3/5, Bayonetta 2, etc.

MGR is up there with the big boys.

I got tricked into thinking that I would play Jetstream Sam, realized later that they had me covered with a DLC :)


This game is an absolute masterpiece. Every single boss fight is a pure pleasure and the equivalent of other games' final bosses.

10/10 Soundtracks

10/10 Gameplay

10/10 Story

10/10 Characters (especially ma man Jetstream Sam)

This game is a perfect fusion of a satisfying playstyle and soundtracks, seven chapters seven great hours.
enjoy your run, and let 'er rip.

-Bisecting enemies does not get old
-Satisfying boss fights
-10/10 soundtrack
-If you like combos, this game has combos
-"make America great again" is a line in this game from 2013

If you buy this game - pay attention when the game shows you how to parry. Your life depends on it

SHEAR class. A CUT above the rest. It doesn't take a SHARP-witted individual to know this game is as SOLID as SNAKE - CUTTING edge perhaps. PARRY good. Get a SLICE of the action when the price gets SLASHED.

metal gear rising is the world's most reliable natural male enhancement. if you experience an erection lasting longer than four hours, that's normal behavior when playing this game, and the game's pretty short so you're probably almost done.

One word.........EPIC!!!

No stealth here. Just balls to the wall action with some of the craziest, insane boss fights I've had the pleasure of undertaking yet. Trust me. I've played A TON of games in my lifetime and the combat in this game is absolutely top-notch. It has a great story too with well done voice acting and beautiful cut-scenes.

My verdict: Play it people!!

Do you like killing stuff as a cyborg-ninja with said katana?
Do you like killing stuff as a cyborg-ninja with said katana while watching your enemy being cut in half according to where you slice him?
Do you like killing stuff as a cyborg-ninja with said katana while watching your enemy being cut in half according to where you slice him to THE. MOST. EPIC. SOUNDTRACK. IN. THE. WORLD?
If you said yes (or no) to any of those things, buy this game. Play this game. Feel this game. Be this game.

Spectacular action, fun times, amazing gameplay.
Plays like a charm on console, but the PC port is a bit clunky.
9/10 - Would kill stuff as a cyborg-ninja with a katana while watching my enemies being cut in half according to where I slice them to THE. MOST. EPIC. SOUNDTRACK. IN. THE. WORLD. again.

Free will is a myth. Religion is a joke. We are all pawns, controlled by something greater: Memes. The DNA of the soul. They shape our will. They are the culture, they are everything we pass on. Expose someone to anger long enough, they will learn to hate. They become a carrier. Envy, greed, despair... All memes. All passed along.

The game does a fantastic job at capturing the overall tone of Metal Gear all the while creating a whole new experience of action-based gameplay that can stand confidently on its own. While the port does suffer from a couple of issues, there is nothing that can't be fixed quite easily.

It's worth mentioning that the QTE's are actually used properly, which is pretty rare in most games. The soundtrack could also very well be one of the best OSTs in action games that I've ever heard.

Fans of other hack 'n' slash games will feel right at home on this one, even if Metal Gear isn't something you're familiar with or cared about previously.

Packed with tons of unlockables and hidden collectables, the game demands multiple playthroughs in order to fully gain access to all of the abilities. While previous entries of the series rely heavily on stealth, it is beneficial on certain parts to use the silent approach but it is never forced.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is an incredible action game that can be enjoyed by Metal Gear fans and non-fans on equal ground.

Pros :

- Quite fun regular gameplay. Simple, easy and nice.

- amazing boss fights,

- GOD TIER soundtrack ( but only for bosses, the rest is meh )

- My most favorite and memorable final boss of any game.

- Though slightly rushed and unpolished, free DLC is awesome, different characters with different playstyles is neat, despite Blade Wolf's combat moveset being rather crappy.

- Cool special boss weapons?

- Cringy, often edgy but fun dialogue. I dont know who the fu.ck wrote the final boss dialogue, but he deserved a raise for sure.

- Extremely quotable. [s] SHOW ME A GOOD TIME, JACK! [/s]

- Better than Kojima's. Thanks, Platinumgames.

Cons :

- Sometimes a bit crappy against multiple enemies

- Camera is horrible

- Sensivity is broken for me on keyboard, but its tolerable. Makes blade mode a pain in the ass but still completely usable. Do yourself a favor and play it on a controller.

- The hardest difficulty, despite being named after the game, is a joke, because it buffs your parry damage ridiculously high. As if parrying wasnt already OP.

- Dodge move which is a near must - have is an optional upgrade which is never explained to the player (???). Buy Offensive Defense as soon as possible.



Despite all the cons, the game is a solid 9/10 imo. I see why many people wouldn't like it, but i personally loved it.

Don’t **** with this game!

Metal Gear Rising marks Platnium's first PC release and the first, major spinoff of the MGS games in awhile. How does it compare to Platnium's past works?

Pros:
Visceral and Fun Combat!
A good scoring system that incentivizes good performance in the game’s levels.
Campy but sometimes ridiculous plot!
Absolutely killer soundtrack.
Fairly decent port.

Nitpicks:
The DLC included in the full game are either cheat items or half-assed bonus missions. Disappointing, to say the least.
VR Missions aren’t fun to play.

Cons:
Strange Game Design flaws such as a awkward camera and the lack of projectiles can hurt the experience.
Cinematic cutscenes look incredibly janky due to being 30fps pre-rendered cutscenes.

The Review

Metal Gear Rising surprisingly takes place after the events of MGS4, where instead of stealthing your way through problems, you’ll be hacking and slashing almost everything as Raiden. So what does Platinum bring to the table?

Of course, as always seen in Platinum Games, highly visceral combat completely steals the show. Platinum’s trademark brawling combat is visibly present in the game, but it takes a lesser focus on combos in favor of the game’s “Blade Mode”, which allows you to (when the enemy is stunned) hack and slash at enemies in almost any angle. So while you can still slash your enemies with simple X/Y button combos, you’ll be performing much better if you take advantage of your normal attacks to than attack vulnerable enemies with precision. As a result, your normal sword slashes definitely won’t feel as powerful as you’d want them to be, but that’s OK because those weak attacks will open up to insane finishers that really drive up the action of the game. It’s a good system that encourages and rewards players to play as best as possible as they can in every single combat scenario, as getting high ranks/slashing certain body parts will net you bonus BP currency needed for lots of upgrades.

However, while the gameplay itself is really well-done, it suffers from some glaring design flaws. The game includes light stealth in it, which seems to be incredibly basic and somewhat tacked-on. The camera is a bit finicky due to it constantly automating Raiden’s backside, and the game throws tons of high elevated/flying enemies at you with a character that’s moveset mostly consist of melee attacks, making fights with them frustrating and annoying. But otherwise, Platnium still delivers a fantastic combat system that will definitely encourage players to replay the game for multiple playthroughs.

The basic plot isn’t as difficult to follow as other MGS games but trying to understand it can be massively disorienting, due to the game’s constant references to real-life events and it’s sometimes weird combination of a gritty or absolutely stupid tone. While it can make the game often have pacing issues, for the most part it’s a surprisingly memorable story with memorable characters and hilarious moments often breaking up the often monotone tone of the game.

The presentation for the game is good. The game does a fairly decent mix of playable performance and eye-popping visuals, and the overall aesthetic of the game is pretty good. The music is on a completely other level, with a stellar soundtrack filled with epic boss battle music and insanely ridiculous metal rock. It sounds like something that wouldn’t fit in a Metal Gear game but it surprisingly complements the insanity of this game pretty well.


The PC Port for the game marked Platnium’s first PC Release, and was fairly alright. The caps it’s framerate at a constantly smooth 55-60fps and the visual settings for the game are minimal at best. While you can change the keybinds if you’re playing with a keyboard I highly advise playing with a controller.

In conclusion, Metal Gear Rising is definitely a good romp to play through. Great combat, stellar gameplay mechanics (with some odd design choices mixed in), and a killer soundtrack really nails it in as a very good Metal Gear spinoff.

TL;DR - The well-thought out combat, campy plot and killer soundtrack makes this one of the best MGS spinoffs you can play right now.

You ever get the feeling like, you just wake up one day and some crazy developer team was hired by an equally crazy developer to make a game in the metal gear franchise that's basically just this crazy fever dream about how raiden should be the main character of his own standalone game? then explosions and brazillian samurais happen, there's a dog with swords and throwing knives and a big tittied cyborg babe who can given twenty men a handjob at the same time, or a crazy redneck shogun dude who's all about the children and smiles too much, and then there's this senator dude who's just pure evil but then he reveals he's actually one of the single most hard-on inducing american patriots in gaming history and he also happens to be an invincible chuck-norris inspired supersoldier?

Yeah, platinum game fever dreams are the best kind.


buy this, it's awesome as hell.

METAL GEAR RISING, A MASTERPIECE BY KOJIMA AND PLATINUMGAMES
One of the best games I've played so far. The game has Smooth Combat, a Good story, Cool Characters and bosses and Two DLC's giving a chance to play as the Brazilian Giga chad Jetstream SAM and our pet Wolfy and of course known for its MEMES . The soundtrack for this game is just chef's kiss .

One thing I wish that was better is to get the certain unlocks(which needs BP), you will need to start the game alll over and does not have the ability to choose which chapter we wanna do over.

Otherwise this game is really good. Definitely get this masterpiece on a sale.
Final Rating: Jetstream Sam/10.

A simple game where a saucy jack tries to kill Hanzo from Overwatch because he and Clayface from Batman killed Obama. A couple establish Rules of Nature later Samurai Jack decides to kill Al Gore just because he chose to play basketball in college (obviously Jack was from a rival college). Anyways it turns out that Neil Armstrong blew NASA's funding to make himself black to obtain the N-Word pass so when responding to physical trauma he can say it all he wants.

Even though I literally beat the game in 5 hours this was the most fun i've ever had with a game in a long time and to be honest the boss fights were amazing it wasnt like any other videogame "3 hits and you win" it was creative and interactive and changed within every fight which was one of my favorite parts of this game.

Cheesy, high-octane swordplay action. Play it once to get a feel and laugh at the cutscenes. Play it again to continue honing your skills. Play it one more time to learn how to parry good and do other things good too.

From what I understand, the story is incongruent with the main MGS series to the point of disrespect - but if you can get over that (or, like me, don't have the background in the first place) you should be able to appreciate this.

+Amazingly fun to hack and slash things into a billion bits (I wish more games did this)
+the characters are super fun and well designed
+silly ass little story, fun to play through
+the music is ballers

-the camera angle made me want to rip my eyes out (please let me control my camera, I don't want to be stuck looking at my face in a fight) this was the most frustrating thing in the game
-a lot of the props are very large, it's funny to notice a vending machine to be twice Raiden's height and tables to be at eye level
-that one kid with the horrible accent oh my god

The game still stands strong for the time it was made, but it would definitely benefit from a rework. The combat is frustrating most of the time, the camera AI needs to loosen up, and the game really needs to teach you how to perform important maneuvers. (I learned how to actually parry super late into the game, something that is VERY important to know for literally every combat)

Cons: Maps can be a bit barren due to the cutting things into a bagillion pieces mechanic.

Pros: Kickass soundtrack. Bosses with lots of personality and great voice acting. Extremely fun boss fights and can be quite challenging (in a good way). Fantastic writing in terms of dialogue.

Years later and I still think about how much fun the bosses of this game were to fight.

I can warmly recommend it, especially if you're able to score it on sale.

I have a "love and dislike" relationship with Platinum Games. Vanquish is my favorite PG game of all-time. Even though I did not like Bayonetta very much, I loved Vanquish, and the feeling is mutual with Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is an action game at its core, and it should not be mistaken for a straight-up Metal Gear Solid game. Hence, the "Solid" word is not even in the title.

What Metal Gear Rising does right is good, action combat. While it may not have the insane and meticulous combo options as Bayonetta, it does enough in the combat department to warrant some good action.

The visuals are spot on for what a 1080p-ported video game would look like on the PC. There are just enough graphics options there. The max resolution is 1080p. It is quite a feat for Japanese developers in general to get a deecent-to-good port. I'll take it.

My only quam with MGS:R is the awkward camera and field of view. Now, before anyone thinks that it is fine for a game of this genre and nature, I would like to step in the argument and disagree. There are video games like Ninja Gaiden that has a good field of view, the developers designed the game to zoom out a certain distance to give the player a good view of the third-person action that is happening during gameplay. Platinum Games dropped the ball here. Since it is not a claustrophobic video game like Dead Space, there is really no reason to make the field of view and camera zoom set to this restricted setting.

MGS:R is best played with a controller so I hope you have a controller.

The story is somewhat cheesy, but I feel like the Metal Gear Solid series was also cheesy to a certain extent. It is good cheese though. It's suitable for this type of game.

Raiden's voice is rather annoying. He sounds like a whimp. Thank goodness he kicks ass in the game.

What else can I say? Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a solid effort from Platinum Games. While it may not match the quality of gameplay as Vanquish and Bayonetta, it is a solid entry for the Metal Gear (Solid) franchise.


Rating: 8.5 out of 10.

Highly recommend, but there are some things you should know.

1.) This does not play like any other MG game, its by the same people who made Bayonetta (gameplay is similar so look up that).
2.) This is a parody of MGS but is still very much laughing with MGS fans (unless you take yourself waaaay too seriously, and this is coming from a MGS turbo nerd).
3.) KB&M input works perfectly fine, but I and many others prefer a controller. Whip one out of you feel clunky.
4.) There is a bit of a learning curve, but if you find yourself having trouble then look at this video:

Holy mother of jesus christ it's a cyborg chopping other cyborgs and robots in a billion pieces like they're made of cardboard.

This game's premise is so ridiculous but nevertheless extremely fun. It doesn't even matter if you're not terribly interested in metal gear or its lore, (although following the story will definitely improve the experience) you will be entertained regardless.

COMBAT
The combat system is obviously the main appeal for the game. Tight combo based swordplay that will feel familiar for anyone that has played bayonetta, or similar titles.

The game rewards execution of parries, combos and using the signature "blade mode" which allows for viciously cutting your enemies in slow motion and in whichever direction you want, to retrieve their internal spine thingy, in order to heal yourself.

There is a weak and strong hit with your blade or secondary weapon of choice (the secondary takes the role of strong hit), and they can be mixed together to pull off satisfying combos that can even launch enemies into the air and it's just so much fun for the whole family.

The parry system works with the same key as the main weak attack, which may seem weird but you get used to it quickly. A dodge+attack system is also implemented via upgrade a bit deeper into the game, which improves the flow of combat and effectiveness of the defensive abilites at your disposal.

BOSSES
Boss fights can be quite challenging, (especially when playing in hard mode, which I definitely recommend) usually requiring of multiple attempts in order to figure out their patterns, attacks that you can parry etc.

Following usual metal gear fashion, they are uniquely designed and have a bunch of gimmicks of their own. The game also features fights against some giant foes that make you feel like even more of a badass cyborg ninja killing machine, which is really what we all want in the end.

Taking a page from megaman, some of the bosses' weapons can be unlocked an used as secondaries which replace your "strong" attack. They come with their own upgrades and add more depth and variety to the combat. The polearm is long range and has flashy spinning combos, the sai allows to stun enemies and the pincers are hard hitting, but slow and they reward timing and predicting the movements of your enemies.

STORYLINE
The story manages to keep itself interesting amongst the crazy amount of action packed cutscenes, which is surprising, although being set in the metal gear universe helps quite a bit.

There are some ridiculous scenes such as the one where it's simply a joy to watch.

EDIT: after careful consideration I'd like to add that the plot and characters in this game are a gift from god in every conceivable way. For some reason they decided to add existential philosophy and a "subtle" (as subtle as an elephant walking the streets of New Jersey) commentary on the war economy and its ramifications to a game about chopping stuff with a hot knife. Somehow they managed to make the most Kojima-esque storyline in a game which he wasn't even involved in for the most part. You will NOT forget a single line of dialogue in this, mainly since it's been memed to death, but the very reason that it's been memed to death is simply because it's genuinely interesting and compelling but it's also a parody of itself pretty much. Anyway, back to the actual review.

OST
When it comes to soundtrack, it mostly consists of adrenaline pumping electronic+metal/rock mix with hardcore elements. It sets the mood quite well and giving the songs vocals instead of keeping them fully instrumental was a good decision I'd say.
"A Stranger I Remain" is my favourite track out of the bunch but all of them are good

NEGATIVES
The camera can be a bit of a mess sometimes. By default, its sensitivity is quite low to keep up with the action, so you'll need to adjust it. Still, it feels weird, and keeping track of multiple enemies can get hard. Before getting the "dodge" upgrade, parrying is your only defensive option, and it's a bit unintuitive, which may throw off a lot of inexperienced players, leading to struggles in the first fights of the game. Most consumable weapons (grenades, RPGs etc) don't feel too satisfying or useful, so you'll end up using the sword for the most part. Only time I found myself actively using them was for some boss fight where EMP grenades were almost mandatory.

Speaking of bosses, while they are fun and unique in which way you approach each one, they are also subject to difficulty spikes. Some bosses feel really easy (cough mistral cough) while others like the blade wolf are hard as balls.

The game's visuals, while not being bad per se, come from this weird drab and "brown" looking era of games. I understand this is metal gear we're talking about, but they could be a bit more colourful and memorable. The level design especially feels quite empty and boring. The game itself is linear and the only incentive for exploring a bit is the possibility of getting consumable items found in boxes around the level.

Finally, it is a bit short. The extra content from VR missions, DLC and replayability of the main story help to mitigate the problem, but it still leaves you wanting more.

CONCLUSION
The game is just really fun and intense. it's more accesible than other metal gear titles because of the focus on action, but it's also deep enough to be rewarding for more advanced players. If you feel like cutting stuff and looking cool while doing it, this is the game to get.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, the spin-off for the Metal Gear series, made as a lightning-speed slasher twisted with Kojima's favorites: pretty long-winded speeches about fates of the world and poor souls in it, and stealth sequences. In the slasher game, it feels really awkward, even ruins the whole game pace sometimes, but... Then again, it is a damn good slasher game. Enhanced with the somewhat unique ability to cut through so many things on every level. Sadly, I can't really describe that selling point feature well enough. I've read some other descriptions before I played the game, but they were not that much impressive as well. You have to see it, actually. Or, even better, try it for yourself.

However, there's one more typical catch: the camera. You know, I've played all my game through without significant troubles, on the standard camera setting. And then I tried to play it on some other PC, on another account, and gosh, it was a terrible experience, where I couldn't follow the enemies' movements, where the camera was always against me and I was always receiving the blows from the directions which I couldn't see. I've tried to tweak it back with the game's options and partially succeeded. But not completely. So, if you see some praisings for Metal Gear Rising in one review, and then some invectives in the next one, know that they both are somewhat on point.

I'm not the one to sing dithyrambs for Kojima's genius, and I actually disdain all that extreme pathos so typical for Japanese-made games. So I was skipping all those unbelievably childish animations and struggling with yawning during unmissable monologues. But as we speak for the action part... I've enjoyed that experience. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is marvelous in that old good ultra-violence, especially when you master the blade mode. Which is not that difficult, but all the way fun (minding the treacherous camera, though).

So, as for markings, let's say 8/10. Skip the boring intermedia overloaded with pathos and let the heads keep rolling!

No stealth here. Just balls to the wall action with some of the craziest, insane boss fights I've had the pleasure of undertaking yet.
Trust me. I've played A TON of games in my lifetime and the combat in this game is absolutely top-notch.

My verdict: Play it people!!

If I could convince anyone to buy and play any game on my Review list as of now (and probably forever) it would be METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE. This game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good (excusez mon français) and has forever changed my outlook on video game quality and what I look for. Amazing soundtrack, amazing designs, amazing gameplay, and a sick ass story. If you do play it, I recommend using a controller instead of a keyboard just because it makes parrying way easier (forward+attack=parry) as well as using Zandatsu. One of the best games I've experienced, thank you PlatinumGames and Kojima (not you Konami, I won't forget about Metal Gear Survive. Eat poopoo).

I have a dream. That one day every person in this nation will control their own destiny. A nation of the truly free, dammit. A nation of action, not words, ruled by strength, not committee! Where the law changes to suit the individual, not the other way around. Where power and justice are back where they belong: in the hands of the people! Where every man is free to think - to act - for himself! F*** all these limp-♥♥♥♥ lawyers and chickenshit bureaucrats. F*** this 24-hour Internet spew of trivia and celebrity ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! F*** American pride! F*** the media! F*** ALL OF IT! America is diseased. Rotten to the core. There's no saving it - we need to pull it out by the roots. Wipe the slate clean. BURN IT DOWN! And from the ashes, a new America will be born. Evolved, but untamed! The weak will be purged and the strongest will thrive - free to live as they see fit, they'll make America great again!... In my new America, people will die and kill for what they BELIEVE! Not for money. not for oil! Not for what they're told is right. Every man will be free to fight his own wars!

Metal Gear Rising is part of the Metal Gear Saga, albeit not in the form known to most of us. It is not a stealth game, it is a totally silly yet cool action game; Raiden, the "hero" of Metal Gear Solid 2, is back as the main character

The gameplay is based around cutting and parrying. You have "Weak" attacks and "Strong" attacks, weak attacks are faster and strong attacks are slower, which can leave you quite open; there's parry, the bread and butter of this game, you can use this technique by pressing Forward and Weak Attack at the same time, note: If you parry too early, it wil just block, you need a certain timing to counter. This will take some time to get used to, but stick with it and it will pay off, especially, at higher difficulties like Revengeance. In the Revengeance difficulty, Parry will most likely kill, break all the armor, or do massive damage to enemies. In lower difficulties this is not the case! So keep that in mind.

Moves, weapons, armor, and misc items are unlocked with BP, points you get while playing the game. I'll be honest and say that quite a bunch of the moves will be rarely used, but are not entirely useless. However, you NEED Defensive Offense, this is your dodge move. Like its name says, it is a defense move that does damage! It is available since the first mission, but in my opinion it should be a standard move instead of buyable.

Zandatsu is another unique mechanic to this game, it is activated while using Blade Mode. Blade Mode by itself, it allows Raiden to control the direction of his slashes, this however, drains enery, this is where Zandatsu comes! When in Blade Mode, and enemies have no armor (this is important), you will see a square with a red outline, if it is slashed you will get a prompt, this makes Raiden remove the enemies' cyborg energy units, which will heal you AND replenish your energy. Done well, you will never run out of energy!

This game has a ranked system, which increases replayability, you get certain bonuses if you don't recieve damage, no kills (Cyborgs are the only ones counted as kills, UGs, or rather, robots are not), or stealth (this is really rare though). Certain ranked battles are hidden and are easily missed, those are the blank squares that show up when you finish a mission.

Bosses, are easily the hightlight of this game game, they are fun, badass, hard and come with amazing music. I shall say no more, however, you will know when you play it.

Being a Metal Gear game, it comes with the traditional VR Missions, they are very varied and they WILL take a while to get S rank.

CONS: This game has a rather pitiful camera, so bear with me and stick with it, you will get used to. But certain encounters, due to location, are in rather tight places and it will cause you to rage and wonder why the hell it is like that. TELL ME ABOUT IT! The game is worth your time though. So give it a try, and you might have a really fun time.

Great game for fans of the genre. The storyline and gameplay are both top notch, and neither feel as if one is sacrificing the other. The combat system is really detailed and for someone who is new to the genre i found the game play to be pretty challenging at first but easy to grasp and get better at.


The Good

* Great story line / graphics / game play
* Solid gamepad controls
* Easy to start, hard to master.



Needs Improvement

* Visibility and camera control issues
* Mouse controls have built in acceleration
* FPS is locked at 60fps, does not support higher fps or higher refresh rates (i.e: 120hz+)



Overall Rating

8 / 10

What a thrill
With darkness and silence through the night
What a thrill
I'm searching and I'll melt into you
What a fear in my heart
But you're so supreme!
I give my life
Not for honor, but for you (snake eater)
In my time, there'll be no one else
Crime, it's the way I fly to you (snake eater)
I'm still in a dream, snake eater
Someday you go through the rain
Someday you feed on a tree frog
It's ordeal, the trial to survive
For the day we see new light
I give my life
Not for honor, but for you (snake eater)
In my time, there'll be no one else
Crime, it's the way I fly to you (snake eater)
I'm still in a dream, snake eater
I'm still in a dream, snake eater

You are JACK THE CYBORG BLADEBOY and you need to defeat the EVIL ROBOT MASTERS as you travel the world with your metal dog and LET 'ER RIP.

If you like character action games even a little bit or are a fan of Metal Gear this game is great. It's balls crazy action of the highest caliber and incredibly worthy of your time.

Metal Gear Rising:Revengeance is Third Person Perspective Hack'n Slash game made by Platinum games and released by Konami, it is also a spin-off to Metal Gear Solid franchisecreated by Hideo Kojima and Kojima productions. This port was released on Steam in 19 february 2013 (Holy crap, my birthday) with all the DLC from consoles.

Story takes place in four years after Metal Gear Solid 4:Guns of the Patriots, which means 2018. Raiden is a cybernetic ninja working PMC specialised in protection of VIPs, however he fails his mission thanks to group of mercenaries known as Desperado Enforcement LCC. and their commanders, Winds of destruction. With new body and equipment Raiden begins his revenge. Not as complicated as in the main series but at least it is a good excuse to cut everything on our way.
Raiden deserves his nickname, because in combat he is fast like a damn lightning god, aside from fast and heavy attack he can use his zandatsu to slow time and cut enemies to pieces as long as his energy meter is not empty, in half of the game he is able to enter ripper mode much increasing damage, but sucking energy from him. Sometimes we can sneak using carton box but it is not giving you any points towards final rank so just ignore it. The key to win every battle is mastering the parry, if you think you cannot block incoming attack you can always dodge (Game will not tell you about that, press x on keyboard, I do not know how to do this on controller).
Beside of various enemies we must face bosses, which are decent because each one of them is more like examinator than executioner, the first one test our bullet dodging skills, second tries our parrying, third require experience in crowd control etc.). QTE exist but they were limited to finishers, which does not make them more enjoyable.
Every location, boss or encounter has one thing that makes this game special, soundtrack. You will not find even one bad track, each one of them perfectly fits everything and makes you sweep faster and faster.
Between missions we can change our equipment, buy new attacks or upgrades. It is worth noticing that beating the game on several difficulties, completing VR-Training missions (that are much harder) and finding collectibles unlocks big part of content which is wuite rare in this age of DLC. None of these items will make you overpowered though.
Graphics are not something incredible but are good enough for a normal PC port.

I do not get how MGR made without Kojima is liked but Metal Gear Survive not. Anyway, back to the case, 8,8/10 for all those hours of fun.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is my Game of the Year by far. I can't say much about this Xbox 360 port that hasn't already been said, the gameplay is phenomenal (for the most part). The soundtrack is the best of the best, I don't like metal that much but i listen to these songs on a daily basis. The story is a little iffy at times, due to it's simplicity (not always a bad thing). My biggest annoyance with the game is how little the game tells you at the start (I'm looking at you, parrying and zandatsu systems), while the game has tutorials on many of the moves you can do, they are all optional, save for the running, jumping, attacking, parrying, etc. while that system is a small inconvenience at times I actually think it works in the game's favor, finding out how to use a new move effectively gives a feeling that I very seldom come across. The absolute worst part of this game is it's length, it's a 5-8 hour long game depending on how thorough you want to be. While some of the bosses and enemies can seem unfair at times they usually require a different approach to them (looking at the final boss for this one), while on the topic of bosses, this game has some of the most fun and challenging bosses that I've had the (dis)pleasure of fighting in a video game, played on normal and died a minimum of 3 times to most bosses.

HIGHLY recommend to anyone who likes shutting their brain off and slicing up cyborgs while talking about memes. 9.2/10


play this game pls i beg

Awesome game. Probably the greatest slasher i've played. There's so much action, the music is so great, the visual style is so unique and appealing that you all be like "MGS, stahp, can't breathe, that's enough, stahp". Right in the first mission, the protagonist is f*cking jumping from missile to missile towards the giant, mean mech that's is shooting them at him. If you love insane action and slashers you'll love this game.

Woooooooowwwwwww. Buy it.

Just getting the unhelpful review part out of my system early.

Buy this game if you like action.
Buy this game if you like Platinum Games (Minus Legend of Korra)
Buy this game if you like difficult games.
Buy this game if you enjoy fun.

Anyway here's the tiny problems that would scare lesser men from this wonderful thing. You're no lesser man, are you?

- Camera sometimes sucks
- Apparently the game isn't that good at teaching you things, I can't say anything about this since I've had exposure before playing.
- Lock on is useless on more than one target.
- It's short if for some reason you don't replay it.
- Some voice acting is just not really good. (But you won't care.)
- You have no reason to give a damn about the story.
- The first boss is adorable but you have to kill it.
- The hype makes me smell awful.
- If you aren't good at the game then it's going to feel sucky and lame :(

Now here's why you should play it.

+ You have no reason to give a damn about the story.
+ Cutting things is just wonderful fun.
+ The combat is amazing minus rare camera mess ups.
+ Everything goes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the end. It's awesome.
+ Delightfully detailed posteriors.
+ You get to murder someone who never shuts up about memes.
+ Particle effects and animations look great.
+ Sam's face.
+ Essentially cardio in game form.
+ You can drop kick a robotic gorilla with a machine gun on its arm, then grab it by the leg, slam it on the ground, and cut it 50 times in a few seconds with bullet time. And then you can eat a cyborg's spine to recharge.
+ Just buy the game.

10/10

MGRR is a very creative and bizarre game in a lot of ways. It takes place in a world where firearms and other contemporary weapons have mostly been rendered obsolete in favor of anime style cyborg ninjas and 50 foot tall mechs. The game was made by Platinum who are famous for the Bayonetta games. And their specific touches combined with the high camp Metal Gear games are known for is very welcome. The gameplay is a very flowy hack and slash and features familiar staples to the Metal Gear series such as VR missions.

Since the game released I've held the opinion Rising is the closest thing to perfectly encapsulating a teenage boy's fantasy. Everything from Raiden's appearance as a fey edgy protagonist, the 90's style anime dub metal that plays during the boss fights, the larger than life dialogue and scenes. It all meshes very well together to create this world you'd fantasize about in between commercial breaks to your favorite anime.

The game is worth getting for the Soundtrack alone!

This is the most stylish and fun game i've played in years, to sum it up its what happens if you mix the lore of Metal Gear and the combat of NieR together (both games made by Platinum Games). The result is astonishing!

Now, where the hell is the sequel?!

Let me start by answering a few basic questions:
1. Does MGR have the mechanical depth of Bayonetta or DMC? No, not even close. The weapons are less versatile, there are less of them and Raiden's abilities aren't as complex as other protagonists in this genre.
2. Does MGR have the complex stealth gameplay of the parent series? No, not even close. What little stealth is here is below Assassin's Creed in terms of depth.
3. Does any of that matter? No, not at all.

This is one of the most unique action games ever made, striking a compelling middle ground between your prestige character action games and more basic hack&slash fare. Combat is fast and frenetic whilst requiring some patience and precision for high level play. If you want to enjoy this game to it's fullest, LEARN THE PARRY MECHANIC: it is barely explained outside of an optional VR mission and without mastering it, you will get slaughtered on higher difficulties.

Unravelling and digesting this games combat system across multiple runs is a joy, and it helps that the game itself has one of the best written (yes I said it), most entertaining short campaigns of the last decade.

Adam Jensen is transformed into an emo weeaboo with a cybernetically enhanced jaw for tactical purposes, after he gets gamershotted by Brazillian Hanzo with a Genji sword and a skinhead with solar panels on his back.

He soon meets an epic doge that he captures like a Pokemon. However, Jensen is soon confronted by Widowmaker with armour made of robot arms and a staff (also made of arms).

Bonus free DLC includes two overly long missions where you play as Hanzo and robot doge respectively. Hanzo has a Fortnite emote that pisses off any enemies that witness it, and doge is terrible at fighting so he has to be all stealthy, it's basically MGSVI.

This game is a good.

Memories broken
The truth goes unspoken
I’ve even forgotten my name

I don’t know the season
Or what is the reason
I’m standing here holding my blade

A desolate place
Without any trace
It’s only the cold wind I feel

It’s me that I spite
As I stand up and fight
The only thing I know for real

There will be blood-shed
The man in the mirror nods his head

The only one left
Will ride upon the dragon’s back

Because the mountains don’t give back what they take
Oh no
There will be blood-shed
It’s the only thing I’ve ever known

Losing my identity
Wondering have I gone insane
To find the truth in front of me
I must climb this mountain range
Looking downward from this deadly height
And never realizing why I fight

Meta Gear Rising is an action hack and slash game in the style of the Devil May Cry Series but in the Metal Gear world. So if you liked DMC you will like MGR.

This game is a pure action game and is nothing like the Metal Gear games which are more stealth oriented games.

You play as Raiden a cyborg enhanced human soldier who fights for a private military firm. The story is set in the future when private military companies are trying to manipulate politics to suite there hidden agenda.

The game is non-stop action with high adrenaline music and epic cut scenes that tell the story. The boss fights are also quiet epic and rewarding when you finally win.
When you advance in the game you receive battle points. With these points you can buy upgrades for your weapons and armour, new battle suits and health and new skills. Hidden in the game you can find upgrades for your health, grenades, ...

A unique skill in this game is the ‘Blade Mode’. When the ‘Blade Mode-bar‘ is full you can activate this. It’s a sort of slow motion sequence when you can cut your opponents in slices – it’s impressive and a big part of the game.

The game is best played with a gamepad. The Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller work flawlessly.

The game can be quiet difficult and frustrating at times – especially the boss fights against the senator.
I nominated the 'Senator' of 'The “Villain Most In Need Of A Hug” Award' in the 2016 Steam Award.

After you finish the game you can access the included 2 DLC stories. In the first story you play Jetstream Sam and in the second you play Bladewolf. Replay ability come from higher difficulty settings, trying to get better battle scores and finding and finishing the more than 50 VR-mission.

The bad :
The game doesn’t support resolutions higher than 1080p. When you want higher resolutions you need to use a ‘hack-program’. I used Flawless Widescreen to play the game in 2560*1080 – 21/9 aspect ratio – this worked without problems but all cut scenes are letterboxed (with black bars).
I believe there is a bug in the game with AMD GPU’s when you activate ‘Blur’ in the graphics options menu. With an AMD GPU you get constant stuttering. With ‘Blur’ deactivated you can play the game at maximum settings.

Conclusion :
I recommend this game.

Metal Gear Rising's gameplay is unbelievably good, it's such a fun time slashing away with your Katana. All the boss battles are amazing and unique, they each have their own charm and are all somewhat challenging. The OST is absolutely phenomenal, lyrics are all great and it did a great job at getting me hyped. Highly recommend playing through this title, you don't need to have any former knowledge of the previous games.

This game is like a turbo futuristic anime on roids!!! Gave me such a thrill!

Story

You are Raiden, the ninja cyborg from the Metal Gear series, and you work as a private sucurity firm for governments around the word. In the very first chapter of the game you meet up with another private security firm called “desperado” who uses its arsenal to provoque conflicts and wars and generate more demand for private security like the one they offer. This leads to unfolding an evil plot around the government of the United States.

Gameplay

This is probably the best Hack and Slash game I’ve ever played, both because of its story and its smooth gameplay. You really feel like you are some kind of future ninja badazz cyborborg slashing everything in your way with this game. You have an energy bar called “blade mode” that allows you to slice apart almost everything in the game, be it enemies or simply the environment. This is one of the few games that actually give you the sensation of being using a sword as a cutting weapon, instead of as some kind of blunt club, as it feels like in most game. Also, mobility is amazing as you have your ninja run button that makes you run and climb fast through the environment.

Boss Battles

The icing on the cake in this game are the boss battles, man, how amazing they are! Each boss has his unique looks and style and also, before fighting, there is the classic philosophical discussion about “good and evil”, “protecting the weak” and the more the villain boasts as brags about his superiority, the more satisfying it is to slice him apart in the end. BTW: Notice how the final boss has a similar mentality to Donald Trump. Coincidence? I don’t think só…

Overall, this is the best slasher that I have ever played, I just wish it were longer…

I give it 4.8/5.0

Despite some frustrating flaws. Metal Gear Rising is absolutely worthy of the Metal Gear name and worth your time if you are a Metal Gear fan.

I am not shy to admit Metal Gear is one of my favorite franchises of all time, including all spin offs. There's more to Metal Gear, than just Metal Gear Solid and games directed by the overly revered to, Hideo Kojima.
In this sense Metal Gear Rising feels simultaneously like a fresh experience and a proper continuation of the world after MGS4.
It's not all perfect as some mechanics and areas dont' feel fully finished or fleshed out. Or outright tacked on. In the case of VR missions, they feel poorly designed and can be incredibly frustrating for all the wrong reasons and is the first time I have called it quits on finishing all the content available in a MG game.

I am going with negative points first, but don't misunderstand me. Despite the problems, I LOVE this game. The fighting system has an amusingly large amount of depth for as unconventional as they designed the system to be compared to contemporary character action games.

Port wise, it's a disappointingly mixed bag. So let's start with cons.
__________
[Cons]
The game only offers a fixed set of resolutions limited to a max of 1080p (Not forward thinking damn it!), you can use a 3rd party tool to edit in other resolutions. But 16:9 only, and often it will break certain rendering.
The mouse cursor doesn't auto hide. Requiring you to move it constantly or use an auto hider program.
It has bug that doesn't properly detect your referesh rate. (Itself caused by stupid HDMI EDID standards for video resolutions that dont' have anything to do with computer use and only serve to screw things up ) This doesn't affect me since I have refresh rates less than 60hz removed with an EDID override.


The biggest problem however is performance stability. The game itself performs extremely well and isn't hard to hit 60FPS for general gameplay. When it comes to maintaining that though,even with both Zan options set to low the game still crushes a single CPU core with Zandatsu, causing the framerate to drop catastrophically. 

However most egrigious is the completely broken frame rate limiter/frame pacing.This damn near ruins the experience if it wasn't for the fact that the existing console versions have genuine framerate problems.

The game runs at 60FPS, but the cutscenes are 30FPS FMV files. In itself not a bad issue, the problem is the frame limiter does not pace the 30FPS videos properly. Leading to tons of dropped frames and hitches during playback.

Even more awful is the 60FPS limiter, at first glance the game seems stable with decent frame pacing and no hitches or microstutter. After about 15-30 minutes the limiter starts to break and frame times are all over the place. At first it's just a one off hitch/stutter ever 20-30 seconds. The more time goes on, the more frequent these stutters/hitches become until they are happening every few seconds or more.

The only way to fix it is to close out of the game and restart it. Believe me I tried everything possible short of having a Free Sync or Gsync monitor.

Forcing driver level vsync doesn't fix it.
Disabling vsync or running windowed doesn't fix it.
Using more or less pre-rendered frames doesn't fix it.
Using a 3rd party frame rate limiter to try and clean up the frame time stability works well until the problem starts occuring. (Using a whole number limit or a fractional framerate limit using config tweaks with RTSS).
I even went so far to think that maybe for whatever reason internally the limit is actually expecting an exact 59.94hz output, so what did I do? I used Custom Resolution Utility to modify my display's actual refresh rate to be as close to 59.94hz as possible (As this display is normally set to 60.001hz. And tests confirm these modifications do actually change the refresh rate) This seems to grant a more stable paced experience a bit longer before the hitching kicks in. But no dice.
I also tried the fan made "Force Fix" for people with refresh rates available lower than 60. And all that served to do was break shadow rendering in random scenes.

I have an older CPU , a Core i7 950 overclocked to 4Ghz. Which can account for the Zandatsu problems. But I doubt it is to blame for the frame pacing problems.



A very pooly designed camera system that has you constantly fighting with it to achieve what you want. This is my biggest complaint game mechanic wise. There are so many situations where the camera just does not work, or does something unexpected and since your input works in relation to the current camera view. Will cause you to be unable to do what you want, ruin a no hit situation, ruin a stealth situation as the camera randomly wants to suddenly rotate back to some strange default posistion.
The game seems to have 4 conflicting camera systems, 1 if you don't use the right stick at all the camera attempts to auto rotate in relation to the character movements or physical boundaries within game space. With how the maps are designed and ESPECIALLY the VR missions. This straight up doesn't work and so you reach for the stick to manually move the camera. This is system 2, however it directly competes for control with system 1 and so system 1 starts counter steering the movements from system 2 causing them to fight for control. (When lock on is used it takes the place of system 1 and I dub this system 4)Leading to the majority of the problems, doubly so when you start hitting physical boundaries in game space. Walk to a wall, try to rotate manually to face opposite and system 1 says no, screw that i'm going to attempt to auto-snap to a predetermined angle instead at the same time. Causing you miss or mess up a cruicial input because again, movements and actions are based in relation to camera space.
System 3 are the cinematic angles used during scripted encounters with bosses or bigger UGs. This takes the place of System 1 and partially disables system 2. When system 4 is enabled it works better here than when used during normal gameplay.
Speaking of system 4, the lock on camera is pretty spotty. It's difficult to simply select the target you really want and the game seems to auto assign based on certain values.
Overall, I don't recall the last time I found myself loudly verbally cursing a game's camera than in Metal Gear Rising and is my biggest complaint about the game overall. Nowhere does this feel more valid than in VR missions where the limitations become even more apparent and it makes the VR missions feel tacked on and obvious that a fixed camera in many scenes would have worked better for this game mode specifically. (Which they did do in the side view stages. Just not consistently across all missions.) The Ninja Kill animation in particular can ruin you in VR missions that require it if you need to make a quick camera adjustment but can't because System 2's camera is locked momentarily after the animation finishes.



Situations where a cutscene ends, just to have you really do nothing gameplay wise but to walk forward and trigger another scene. These feel like they should've been just one continuous scene, and in general I wish the cutscenes were slightly longer. Codec conversations are a plenty however and feel right at home.
Cutscenes are disappointingly for the first time in the series offline rendered in-engine video files. And they are only 720p in resolution. Effects quality is a lot higher here and the compression is actually on par with the PS3 version at least. But image quality is still a bit rougher since there is still a ton of aliasing due to them being rendered at 720p.

Good ass game, one of Platinums best.
Too short sadly, and the combo system is kinda limited. Still, very good.

Standing here
I realize
You are just like me
Trying to make history

But who’s to judge
The right from wrong?
When our guard is down
I think we’ll both agree

That violence breeds violence
But in the end it has to be this way

I’ve carved my own path
You followed your wrath
But maybe we’re both the same

The world has turned
And so many have burned
But nobody is to blame

Yet staring across this barren wasted land
I feel new life will be born
Beneath the blood stained sand
Beneath the blood stained sand

Got it again on Steam just for the replay...

+ One-man moshing to obscenely loud music
+ Over the top voice acting and characters
+ Intense boss battles and decent combat
+ "Nanomachines, son"

- Camera doesn't keep up and in a bad way
- Konami was here

This game is THE GAME.

RATING:	🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 5/5	PERFECT GAME


Raiden is probably the most badass character in a videogame ever.

Every boss music was selected by a genius.

Every inch of his shining body was designed by a legendary blacksmith.

And that sword capable of cutting an entire building in half will surely keep all the others in their sheath.


To buy or not to buy?
Buy it, and you will see it for yourself.

Meanwhile, I'm still waiting for the sequel. Hurry up PlatinumGames.

I could just link you to sounds of sensual moaning, but I think I'd rather use my vocabulary to describe why Metal Gear Rising: Revengence is an astoundingly great game. Yes, I'm using sections, because a simple blurb wouldn't do this masterpiece justice. I should note that I had very little prior experience with the Metal Gear series, having only played about a half of the original Metal Gear Solid.


Premise
You play as Raiden, a cyborg ninja with a very violent and traumatizing past. Part of Maverick Security, a self-titled "private security contractor", you and your agency have spent the past three years protecting a fledgling African nation while it grew into a prosperous society. All that changes when the president of the nation is kidnapped and assassinated by another cyborg, who works for one of your rivals, Desperado LLC. From there, you find out the who, what, and why of the assassination - the misery branches off from there.

Being a cyborg ninja, you have quite a lot of finesse, leaping over buildings and other objects with ease. Of course, no ninja of questionable authenticity would be caught dead without a katana, or rather, a High-Frequency blade. With it, you can cut nearly anything and anyone with ease - mind the other cyborgs with one, though!


Gameplay
The Sword
By now, you can probably tell that Metal Gear Rising's meat and bones is the HF Blade. It's most obvious application is slashing up enemies. There are two modes of attack: light and strong. Light allows Raiden to attack without breaking his run, while heavy, while more damaging, forces Raiden to come to a complete halt. There are many combos to learn and attack styles to perfect, but it never becomes quite as overbearing as a fighting game's controls.

Parrying. Parrying parrying parrying. The most important maneuver in the game. Without it, your enemies will make mince meat of you, especially on higher difficulties. When an enemy glows red, it is time to parry. Press attack + the direction in which the enemy is, and you will successfully parry if you get the timing right. Forgive me for typing the previous two sentences out as though I were writing a textbook, but it is better to learn it now than in-game, hair ripped out and four hours wasted on the first boss.

Blade mode is another crucial element to MGR's swordplay. It can be activated at any time to slice objects or people more accurately, but people are what it's primarily used for. After widdling down an enemies health to a certain degree, you can go into blade mode and perform Zandatsu - a maneuver in which you slice the enemy in half and rip their cyborg guts out, exploding them in your hand to regain health and energy for blade mode. It's as awesome as it sounds.

With these elements combined, the swordplay is extremely smooth and satisfying, when done correctly. Zandatsu is just the cherry on top, the thing that makes everything else worthwhile.

Encounters and Rankings
Encounters (not official nomenclature) are composed of enemies of varying strength and difficulty. Most are boxed in and prohibit the player from progressing through the terrain. Not much else to say about the encounters themselves, but each are ranked from D to S, D being "you suck ♥♥♥♥" and S being "you didn't take any damage and got lots of points". Points are awarded depending on the enemies killed, the number of Zandatsus performed, the damage you took, and the time it took you to beat it. At the end of each chapter of the game, you ranks are tallied up to form a rank for the entire chapter. Those points aren't just for show, either...

Upgrades
Upgrades are what makes getting those points worthwhile. After every checkpoint in the game, you are able to go to the cleverly-titled "Upgrade Screen" and buy upgrades for Raiden. You can give Raiden's sword stat increases, buy unlocked "sub-weapons", increase Raiden's health and Blade Mode battery, and even get different skins for his armor. This system is one of the reasons why Revengence is as replayed as it is, as it allows for upgrades to be carried over to a new game.

Stealth
Although Metal Gear Rising is primarily an action game, there are many segments where stealth is not only an option, but is encouraged. Running up behind an enemy and pressing the action button will activate Ninja Mode - which is a fancy way of saying you can slash enemies silently. The cardboard box is as useful a tool as ever, and there are even smoke grenades to help sneak past enemies. It is also worth noting that sneaking past an area that is set up for an Encounter forgoes the grade you would get for fighting, which can be quite useful for keeping a consistent grade.

Secrets and Unlocks
A lot. Magically turns 5 hours into 40.

Overall
Though it isn't in the title anymore, the gameplay is still SOLID. The swordplay is engaging, the scoring and upgrade systems are rewarding and encourage replayability, and the stealth system feels like a natural extension to the gameplay. The only complaint that I have is that the camera can't keep up with the action sometimes - like it realizes how awesome you're doing and freaks out.

As a side note, I think complaints that the story is only five hours long is misguided, to say the least. This is a game all about skill, improving yourself. As such, you'll want to go for better rankings and for harder difficulties, because you want to see how good you can get. At bare minimum, you'll keep playing for the upgrades and unlocks, which, as previously mention, add a sizable amount of time spent playing. VR missions, small challenge levels, add even more length and challenge. Even if that doesn't tide you over, at least Revengence comes with two DLCs that lengthen the experience by a few hours.


Presentation
The gameplay is spectacular on it's own, but it's how the game presents itself that propels the entire experience to greatness.

Story
Without going into much detail here (partially because of spoilers, partially because of laziness), Metal Gear Rising's story is... wild. And deep. What starts off as a simple mystery turns into a... err... complex mystery, filled with conspiracy and political ideology. Though the game has an air of self-aware cheekiness, it manages to be surprisingly engaging when the plot gets good. At the game's climax, the wackiness and the seriousness combine to create something utterly incredible. Also of note is the boss characters - possibly the coolest portrayal of traditional archetypes I've ever seen.

Sound
You know a soundtrack is good when you actively have to force yourself not to type the lyrics in all caps right this second. Much like the story, it is both over-the-top and yet extremely captivating. The lyrics to the songs are pertinent to the story and characters, with boss theme's reflecting their respective character's personalities and modus operandi. The music that plays during regular encounters is a treat as well, while the stealth music feels calm and controlled. Nu-metal was a surprisingly perfect choice for the feel of Revengence.

Graphics
Honestly, probably the weakest part of the whole package. Most of the environments look extremely drab, sometimes muddy - I didn't know a cloudy day in Denver looked that horrid. Meanwhile, the characters, while well designed, have low texture quality - it's not very noticeable unless seen very close.


Conclusion
Metal Gear Rising: Revengence is a well-thought out, well-crafted game. It might not try to swoon the player with promises of progressive writing *cough* Bioshock Infinite *cough*, but between its fantastic gameplay, high-but-attainable skill ceiling, fun and engaging story, and rocking soundtrack, MGR lives and dies by its dedication to the hardcore. I don't like to flaunt being a gamer, but if you consider yourself to be one, a TRUE one, pick this up without hesitation.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance * 8/10

Metal Gear Rising is the last chapter in the Chronological Timeline of the Whole Metal Gear Saga. But even though it shares the story, the settings and the themes with the saga it essentially throws in the dumpster all the stealth mechanics that marked and represented all the other titles in favour of a more rushing hack'n'slash style. Well, to be honest even the story is secondary as it's quite simple and lets the player focus more on the gameplay and the characters' charisma.

4 years after the Patriots incident Raiden finds himself working for Maverick, a Private Military Company, with the task of protecting N.Mani an African country prime minister. Another underground outlaw PMC named Desperado will assault your convoy to kidnap the senator and eventually kill him. You will fight your way to the PMC leader, Jetstream Sam, and as usual you will be defeated, then the real game will start.
Until that moment you will have already seen most of the key elements of this game. As I've already mentioned the game is definitely a Hack & slash game with a particular innovation: Raiden's katana. Your main weapon is capable of completely cutting almost everything, starting from your enemies during blade mode, where time slows down and you can slice your opponents in literally hundreds of pieces while your energy drains during this action. You can't roll away from enemies attacking you (an I HATED this) but the only way you can defend yourself from enemies attacks is a parry system which is assisted on easier difficulties and manually tough on harder difficulties. there are miniboss fights and other fights with HUGE enemies, time action events and extreme action situations that look taken straight from anime such as vertical running sections or jumping on rockets being fired at you. Definitely beyond the limit, but tough and awesome at the same time. Some advanced sections will try to give you a cardboard box and a barrel, both to be used as in a common metal gear, the problem is that besides some forced sections you never feel like it's a good idea to use them as there are always too many enemies and there are rarely blind spots to use for a stealth approach. Exactly the same feeling for the couple of rocket launchers or grenades you can find here and there, I've finished the game and I've used them 2 or 3 times...
As in any respectable Hack & slash game you can improve your character's health and energy, moves, weapon and cyborg armour, though for the first 2 you need to find the relative upgrades hidden in the level. Also you can find VR missions hidden in the levels, which can represent a valid enterteinment expanding the durability of the game, considering that they're not all simple VR missions but some of them include some original mechanics that add that variety to the missions.
Included with the game there are also 2 DLCs unlocked at the end of the main campaign: Jetstream Sam and Wolf prequel Stories which give a little more life to the game, and I advice to play both of them because even if they're short they're still pretty good. There are some tough VR missions hidden there as well (not reachable through the main VR menu).
The game is developed with the Platinum Engine (not Fox Engine), and even though it doesn't make any particular miracle it does its job.
The soundtrack is really tough and badass as it follows and incites the player in the toughest and most intense fight sections especially Boss Fights.


+++PROs+++
GAMEPLAY. Even though a Metal Gear fan could see the total change of gameplay as a trauma, it really is great and fun, a very tough challenge, especially the final Boss and considering how Raiden has been portrayed in MGS4 I personally consider this change of direction and gameplay perfectly understandable.
SOUNDTRACK. Since this chater is a frantic Hack & Slash a badass soundtrack is a MUST. So, what can I say... Check![/] CHARACTERS. I noticed a nice and deep portray of some characters, say Raiden, Jetstream Sam, Wolf and The "final boss", just to mention some, without spoilers.
EXTREME. Considering the legacy and the previous chapters, what is to be seen in this title is extreme: vertical runs and jumping on missiles are the two smallest and least spoilerous examples I can come up with... Yet I Really appreciated all of this, the frenzy of the normal gameplay mixed with these extreme time action events and tough boss fights, and all shown with a great direction worth of Kojima's blessing.
---CONs---
FIGHT STYLE. For a frenzy Hack & Slash game like this being deprived of the ability of dodging attacks in favour of a tough parry system can be a tough challenge but I honestly believe it simply kills the action as you have to wait a long cooldown tie before you can attack and most of times you are forced to parry a sequence of attacks, not just an attack. Not to mention the fact that some attacks can't be parried and you don't have the ability to dodge...
FAILED STEALTH MECHANICS. This game is part of Metal Gear Legacy, yet the developers chose to take the H&S direction, which is fine, considering the character and all the rest. Then Why in the hell try to put just a fistful of forced stealth sections if the only way you can run them is just with boxes or drum cans. You can't crouch, nor crawl, nor get against walls or other props to stay hidden, you can't make noise to distract enemies unless you sprint close to them. No, Stealth as made in this title is quite pointless.
CAMERA. I didn't find myself too comfortable with the camera and control settings. strafing left or right results in turning the camera as well. The camera is slightly left sided, can't be changed and in few times I find it being too close to Raiden. When you want to take a good look at the situation from an observation point or when hiding in the carboard/barrel if you move the camera and leave it still for a second and a half it will instantly turn back... So you essentially can't observe anything taking your time and all... And last and least important the camera look seems quite "uninterpolated"... as if you want to turn left or right a very little bit the camera skips to the next angle instead of sliding smoothly from A to B... I don't know how to explain but it is more evident when you move slightly or even more while you're on codec.

I played this game on this machine:
Intel Core i7-4970
16Gb RAM DDR3
GeForce GTX 660
Windows 10 Professional x64

GO NINJA!! GO NINJA!! GO!!!

Man i had this game in my library for quite some time now. I tried to play it with Mouse and Keyboard and failed so hard. I got a Steam Controller a few months back and was looking in my library and remembered the game, so i reinstalled it and used my Steam Link and Steam Controller. Man 100% better!! The game play is action packed and controles are real nice .

The games Story is nice and the GFX are pretty good cranked all the way up.The hack and slash combat is so satisfying bigtime when you pull off a nice combo. The game has some nice upgrades also for Raiden as you progress and collect points. Then you can spend the points on upgrades.

The games music is also a big part keeps you pumping as you slice and dice and hack and slash !

I would highly recommed this game 100% ! Just make sure you have a controller ;) Also even if you arent a Metal Gear fan (WHAT ! Crazy! ), i think you would like this one. So check it out !

Pros:
- graphics
- story
- action (1st boss fight w/in 10 minutes or less of playing)
- swords

Cons
- um... if i had to name one... the camera pisses me off more than anything. Its far too close and annoying as hell to turn in the correct direction mid fight... ESPECIALLY when there are multiple enemies and they bolt across sides of the map (machines mostly)
- this is an issue using an xbox 360 controller, not sure if mouse_keyboard users have same issue


Recommend?

- if you like hack and slash ~ yes
- if you like MC that look like robot chicks ~ yes
- if you feel like swords should be used via foot more often ~ yes

Do you feel hardcore player because you beat Dark Souls?
Do you feel parry master because you beat Sekiro?
Do you feel master at exploring because you found all kodama in Nioh? (wait that does not make sense...)

ANYWAY

This game will hurt your ego, not because it has:
-NO HIT BOSS Achievements.
-Revengeance which not only you can die from 1-2 hits but also enemies are attacking way faster.
-VR Missions which even if you pray to Kojima you can't pass them.

This game will hurt your ego, Because:
-CAMERA POV IS FREAKING DISGUSTING AND LOCKING ON ENEMY DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE IT AUTO CHANGES TARGET WITHOUT HAVING A SETTING TO CHANGE THAT.


Beyond these, it's gud geim.

It has beast soundtrack and characters with good motivates which gives you food for thought.

The aesthetic is honestly super cool if you are a little boy at heart. Swords, cyborgs and over-the-top rock guitar solos. I had a ton of fun and it ran really well even on my laptop.

Year 2013 let's create some cool sword game where you can parry attacks with sword. Community - game is so complicated, parry is not obvious, bad dodging. Let's better play dodging games again. Year 2019 sekiro uses parry in game, omg what a new approach like never before. Amazing game with excellent combat system. I know only 3 games where you can use parry with same satisfaction - sekiro, nioh and metal gear. Very cool boss fights, nice characters. Hope capcom will consume konami some day.

So there I was, just sitting on my Harley Davidson at the PC, revving my engine and doing burnouts, when suddenly a steam ad popped up for "Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance". When I found out the main character was a cyborg I thought "hang on a minute, if he's a cyborg... That means he can rev AND biff at the same time... Maybe even do a burnout with his phallic member(try this at home)!

After playing for a while I encountered a cutscene that made me want to turn gay, or at least embrace my inner homosexual. The player character catches a knife in his elegant high heels while striking a sexy pose and showing off his nice body. On the second playthrough I equipped him in red armour just to see if he looks sexier in red heels

When I finally unlocked customization the first thing I looked for was a V12 engine, it was not there. I then looked for twin-turbos, still not there. So I thought, at the very least, we should be able to attach wheels to ourselves so we can do a burnout, isn't that the first thing all cyborgs want to do? No wheels. No burnouts. You can, however, still get extra revs in your engine & better fuel economy, but what good is extra revs if you can't do a burnout..? Well, you still can do a form of burnout; the extra revs allow your mind to just rotate in place at around 9999RPM, spinning with such fierce velocity that it actually causes your brain to do a burnout against the walls of your skull and grind itself into a dense smog.

Once you purchase the maxed brain burnout upgrade and rev it hard you reach the point where all you can see is Hideo Kojima. Why can you see Hideo Kojima? Because you have just exceeded the boundaries of reality and entered the "Kojimaverse". I would recommend at this stage taking an entire plethora of psychedelic and narcotic substances, as the cutscenes will make much more sense that way, as will the plot and Hideo Kojima's mindset(or lack thereof) while making this game.

All in all this game is an excellent example of why drugs are bad, and should be bought for your children at a young age to properly indocrinate them against drugs. Those of you whom it is too late for such things will, however, probably enjoy the last piece of your sanity rotating around inside your skull, going up in smoke and slowly drifting away like a fart in the wind, right off into the sunset.

And your sanity lived happily ever after. The end. [s1.reutersmedia.net]

Metal Gear Rising: Revengance, the game that made up a word just to sound cool. Well, this game does a lot more than sounding cool, it just straight up is. Every battle is epic, especially the boss battles.

There isn't a whole lot to say except the combat is simple but very enjoyable. Platinum is great at making games with incredibly fun combat, just look at Bayonetta. And every boss fight is unique and interesting, and never feels like boss mechanics are reapeating.

I do want to point out some negatives. The story is just bad, I don't care what anyone says. I know people like to say "well its just cheesy and fun". No, I'm sorry, its bad and poorly written and voice acted. The cheese did make me laugh a few times, so its not the worst thing, and there are some decent moments, but overall its bad and your honestly not missing much if you skip over it. Another thing to mention is the camera angles. Several times when I was trying to stealth my way through a section(something I think this game could have done without. I know you can fight your way through these sections but the game makes it clear when it wants you to sneak. I get its a metal gear game, but its moreso an action hack and slash, we don't need stealth), and the camera would sometimes take control of itself from a corner and push the view to an entirely different spot. Very annoying, and I did have one instance where the camera wouldn't let me see a damn thing and it caused me to die.

Despite this Metal Gear Rising has a very strong combat system with some pretty cool upgrades and different weapons to make combat varied, and the game doesn't outstay its welcome. It took me about 8 hours to beat the main story. Very much worth the buy, just be warned if you don't like cheesy stories, it'll make you roll your eyes.

Pros:
-Amazing Soundtrack
-Fun combat
-Good level design
-Short, doesn't outstay its welcome
-Very awesome boss battles
-Collectables
-Bonus missions to do when your done with the story

Cons:
-Story is dumb
-Camera angle can be wonky.
-Shoe-horning in stealth because its metal gear.

Before I get started with the review, I must inform everyone that I played with a controller and not the keyboard and mouse. Some people have had trouble using a keyboard and mouse with the game while others have said that it's better than using a controller. If you do not have a controller then I suggest that you check out other reviews and see if it has good keyboard/mouse support. I'm using what is essentially an Xbox 360 controller. This review will only encompass the main game and not the DLC. I will do my best to not spoil any of the story.

The first thing I'd like to talk about is the interface. Metal Gear Rising's menus aren't what I'd call perfect but they're functional. One of the biggest issues that I've found with the main menu happens to be pretty minor; you can't quit the game without loading your save file first. It's a negligible issue to me but I see it brought up in the Steam forums quite a bit so some people might consider it a bigger issue.

Main Menu and Options Menu:

The item menu could stand to be improved but it's likely that you'll never use it in combat anyways. It pauses the game when you press left or right on the directional pad and allows you to pick which weapons you want. When you're being attacked or in the middle of an attack animation then it will seem unresponsive.

The heads up display has a lot of information being shown. Whether or not this is a good thing depends on how much hand-holding you want. It at least keeps itself out of the way during battles and doesn't cover up the entire screen.

The gameplay is a bit more than just hacking and slashing your way through enemies. It requires accurate timing and precise aim with your sword while under time constraints. Battles are drastically different from the previous entries to the Metal Gear franchise. Stealth is now harder to pull off and there is more emphasis on the action.

You can tell that the boss battles will be over-the-top once you see the first boss. They put you up against a modified Metal Gear Ray in the first few minutes of gameplay. From slicing the armor off to even throwing the Metal Gear, it's clear that Raiden is a lot stronger than he was in previous games. Metal Gear Rising seeks to make you feel like a super-human and I feel like it succeeds in doing so.

Metal Gear Ray battle from the Xbox 360 version:

Views: 178,841
See Raiden fight in a sombrero http://bit.ly/11T63Hs Watch Raiden rip a Ray to pieces in this lengthy boss battle from the beginning of Revengeance.


The bosses are unique in Metal Gear Rising. Every single boss has its own way to beat it and even their own theme songs. I feel like this is where Metal Gear Rising shines the most; the boss battles. While the regular enemies put up a bit of a fight, they're mainly just fodder for your blade even on the highest difficulty settings.

The contrasting difficulty from regular enemies to bosses might seem a bit unbalanced, especially when you go up against the final boss which is probably one of the hardest bosses in any game that I have played. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually lost against a final boss. From health regeneration to a larger pool of health and insanely powerful moves that you can only dodge, Platinum Games knows what they're doing to make a boss feel difficult rather than just tedious like so many final bosses in other games.

If it weren't for the amazing music, I probably would have had a harder time against the final boss. That brings me to my next point: the soundtrack. Metal Gear Rising's soundtrack might seem a bit strange for a video game but it definitely suits the gameplay. Each song is different and the lyrics suit the boss that they're made for. The boss battles with their amazing songs are the main reason why I'd consider replaying the game over and over.

One of my favorite boss battle themes(Mistral):

The story is one of the only parts of the game that doesn't really shine. You're a cyborg who has to kill terrorists and that's as much as you need to know in order to justify your character cutting people into tiny bits. The story only briefly references the events of Metal Gear Solid 2 and 4 so it's good even if you haven't played any other Metal Gear games. There are only around two hours of cut-scenes this time which is less than other Metal Gear games; to put this into perspective, Metal Gear Solid 2-4 each had five hours of cut-scenes while the original Metal Gear Solid had over three.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is one of the best action titles of 2013 and I'm glad that Platinum Games ported it to the PC. I feel like they did a good job on the PC port besides a few technical issues that they can easily fix in a patch. There were no noticeable bugs when I played through the game and I feel like it was a polished game.

The PC port is locked to 60 FPS and the resolution can only go as high as 1920x1080. If you're using HDMI then you may run into the same bug as I did where the game switches to interlaced mode by default in 1920x1080. The solution to fixing this problem is to run the game in windowed mode and then using the Windowed Borderless Gaming tool.

Overall, I feel like this game is worth buying if you're a fan of action games. The game looks much better than it did on the PS3 and 360 due to the increased resolution, frame-rate, anti-aliasing, and texture filtering. If you haven't played this game before then I recommend buying it on the PC if your specs are good enough. It's easily one of the best action games I've played so far.

The PC port of this game is a good one. You've got AA/AF options, plus low/medium/high settings for shadows, how long debris stays, and how many pieces you can cut things into. On my 660Ti, I could run at 1920 x 1080 with MSAA x 2, AF x 16, and everything on high and it holds at 60 FPS with no Vsync tearing whatsoever.

As for the game itself? This was my pick for best game of 2013. It's a Bayonetta/Devil May Cry style action title with stylish choreography (and it's not just limited to the cutscenes; you can and will be doing this stuff yourself) combined with the characterization and dialogue of a traditional Metal Gear title. And there's quite a lot of that, too: if you voluntarily listen to all of the codec conversations and don't just skip the cutscenes, this game is about as long as a "normal" Metal Gear Solid game. Anyone saying "it's short!" is neglecting to point this out, as most of the codec dialogues are optional.

Stealth exists for sections but is actively discouraged. In true Platinum Games fashion, the most critical and fundamental of gameplay mechanics is left under-explained. In this case, that's how to properly parry and dodge (you'll actually have to purchase aerial parrying and the dodge as upgrades, though they are inexpensive and among the first upgrades available). As with most Platinum games, you can go through much of the game without quite "getting" how they work, but once you've got it down your effectiveness will skyrocket. Hint: you have to move the stick FROM NEUTRAL towards the direction of the attack before hitting X.

Platinum Games are about "mastery" more than just "completion." You don't simply beat this game and conclude "well, I've beaten it, now onto the next game" like we do for most action titles. To do so would be missing out on a lot of what is offered. Here, you're graded on each encounter, and to get every encounter per level you'll want to backtrack and intentionally get spotted so as to trigger more fights. Doing better means more points to spend on character and weapon upgrades. You'll get several weapons each with several moves and their own applications. Feel free to use whatever you feel like. Replay past levels using the weapons you got from later stages. Then try out the VR challenges and higher difficulties. And now you can choose to skip straight to the boss fights upon completion (all Metal Gear games should have this).

This is the sort of game where there are multiple difficulties above Hard. The sort of game that's meant to be PLAYED rather than watched in a video playthrough in order to truly experience it. I beat it on PS3 last year, and now I feel like doing it all over again on PC. Here's hoping Metal Gear Solid 5 comes out on Steam too!

This is NOT Metal Gear Solid. And that is OKAY.

After seeing Raiden go from rookie ♥♥♥♥♥ to cyborg ninja badass from MGS2 to MGS4, most of us have wanted more of him, his story, and to take control. It is still very much cemented in the MGS universe we know so well, just with entirely different and ridiculously fun gameplay. The attention to detail, replayability, options, etc. are all amazing, only to be shadowed by the soundtrack. I wouldve bought this game at twice the price

EDIT Nov 2017: I'd like to add I still listen to songs from this soundtrack daily, and literally fall asleep to them most nights. This has been the case for over 3 years now

I bought MGR:R years ago (and also tried the demo at a friend's house at the time) but it's only in the last few weeks that I've gotten into it.

One of the perfect games on the Steam Deck. Runs at 60FPS with maximum settings (yes the game is almost 10 years old but even). Everything is easily readable.

The game is extremely fun and after assimilating the blocking, I enjoyed MGRR a lot. Combats are fast-paced with interesting mechanics. Plenty of amazing cut-scenes.
Too bad that on some bosses, the confrontation lasts for ages.

Interesting fact: despite the game being released in 2014 on PC, there are sometimes thousands of players on Steam. Maybe the Steam Deck effect?

By the way I completed Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance around 10h.

Definitively recommend MGR:R even if you don't have a Steam Deck.

Let me just say, Raiden left a poor impression on me first time around in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.
When he reappeared  I sort of felt bad for him, but at the same time he was far more experianced and pretty damn awesome. Now I've played as Raiden again and it has been a blast!
This is not your typical Metal Gear game, however. It's nothing like the famous Solid series. This game was developed by Platinum Games. Metar Gear Rising: Revengeance plays out similarly like Bayonetta in both structure and combat. It is chapter based and focuses mostly on combat and rates you how well you performed, but it does reward you some for exploration.
Hack and slash your way to victory!

Sometimes when I watch battle anime such as DRAGON BALL, BLEACH, HOKUTO NO KEN and YUU YUU HAKUSHO I want to experience iconic battles not only as a mere spectator. Well, Lightning Bolt Action delivers exactly that. With songs that give an adrenaline rush, take the blade into your fingers, slice up your enemies as incredible fighting machine and fight against one of the best and spectacular bosses that Japanese game development can offer!

Here is a list of reasons I believe you should play this game.

1. The gameplay is super satisfying once you get the hang of it, slicing enemies into tiny chunks feels great
2. The story is hilariously dumb and it knows it, it will almost certainly get a few laughs out of you
3. The campaign is relatively short and super replayable, featuring tons of collectibles for you to get along the way
4. Every single character is absolutely amazing, especially the main villain.

METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE

A hack and slash game with well deserved Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. another great game by Kojima Productions and PlatinumGames. METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE takes the renowned METAL GEAR franchise into a new arc and gives the game some new features and combat machines. Released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows this game received a well-deserved welcome by all.

Story

METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE takes place four years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. Four years after the events of the Guns of the Patriots Incident, [b1] Raiden [/b1] ( our protagonist ) has been contracted by a private military company (PMC) Maverick Security Consulting, Inc for VIP protection, military training, and other duties.

The game starts off by showing Radien riding with a VIP who he is tasked with protecting. Suddenly they get ambushed and attacked by cyborgs. Led by the cyborg Samuel Rodrigues. During the attempt of trying to rescue the VIP Radien is confronted by the cyborg and defeated. Rescued and reconstructed by his PMC, Raiden starts his journey of vengeance.
his search for Samuel Rodrigues and the company he's working for, Desperado Enforcement LLC.

Gameplay

Being a great Hack and Slash game, the game focuses majorly on combat. and I must say the combat mechanics in this game is very enjoyable and addictive. once you find a combo you like you will be intrigued into using that one only ( or maybe it's just me ). The game starts by lets you some few combats moves than later lets you unlocked other farther down the road. Jumping and running feels very satisfying.
Running headfirst dodging enemies attacks and hacking them to the ground done well. Boss fighters are enjoyable and very well done, I wish there were some more bosses to hack down.

I could write a novel on how much I enjoy MGR: R.

But I'll keep it short.

The game is a really intuitive game, with a unique and rewarding combat system. The parry is extremely satisfying when you pull off a perfect parry, or block many hits in quick succession. The offensive-defensive, the game's dodge move, also grants a high skill ceiling, with a few frames of invulnerability enabling you to dodge most everything that can't be parried. Mashing the attack button grants an infinite combo, though there's not any hit stun from flaling wildly for most enemies. As Raiden, you are quite literally lightning incarnate. Raiden's not supposed to tank damage, instead you have to block, parry and dodge things.

The boss rush mode in the PC port is a very welcome addition. All of the boss fights in the game are challenging and the variety of them is great. Armstrong's bossfight is nothing like Khamsin's. There's alot of content just in them.

One of the other unique parts of the game, and my personal favorite aspect of it, the OST is very, very good. It's an eccentric mix of electronic-house style music with a dash of contemporary rock and power metal. The soundtrack's vocals kick in at just the right moment in the game's action to give the music a very emotional and exciting complement to the on screen events.

Storywise, the game is still a Metal Gear game. A cyborg ninja and robot dog team up to try and end modern war as a business. Raiden's character arc here is really cool. It echoes MGS2 with Raiden coming to grips with himself, instead of the identity he presents himself as. It's tongue and cheek and over the top at times, but this is nothing new for the series.

The Keyboard and mouse controls are not bad, but you'll want a controller.


There are a few flaws in the game, though. The game's short. (around six to seven hours your first time through.) and the camera messes up frequently. Ninja run is also pretty buggy, you'll die unfairly to messed up pathing a few times through. The DLC, thankfully included for free in the PC port, is not the best. Jetstream Sam's DLC is interesting, but ends too soon, not really giving you an opportunity to use your newfound (though limited) skillset for very long. Bladewolf's DLC is stealth based, but is also very short and re-uses almost all of it's assets from the base game.


Overall I'd say MGR:R is a solid 9.5/10.

The very best action game I've ever played. There's nothing like ripping apart cyborgs with stylish combos. The story is also great and is seriously some of best political commentary I've seen in a game.

This game is FUN... just so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FUN. Deep and insanely satisfying combat, story that contains more cheese than Switzerland produce for the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ year, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ soundtrack, great visuals. What else could you possibly want? Also, PC port is suprisingly well made when you take into account that this is Platinums first foray into PC gaming. All in all, an absolutely great game. Do yourself a favor and buy it if you still care for having fun and actual gameplay in your video games.

YANOGA REVIEW

GRAPHICS - ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆
From a technical point of view this game feels a bit older. Also there are some minor Bugs. But the very unique Artstyle with Japanese, Cyperpunk and Metal Influence makes this a Joy for the Eye. Also the Cutscenes are over the top with very memorable scenes!

MUSIC - ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
Metal meets Future/Industrial Elements. Also very unique - I think you will hate or love this Soundtrack there will be no between. I LOVED IT!

STORY - ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
Cyborg Ninjas talking about Philosophie while ripping their Limps off. Very Unique and well written Story. Gets very crazy and funny sometimes but surely is something fresh and entertaining.

GAMEPLAY - ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆
Classic God of War with an Sword Element where you can cut Limps of with precise strokes. The Camera is clunky something and you'll need sometime to get a feeling for blocking. Beside that it's an gorgeous Hack'N'Slay!

WORTH BUYING - ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
If you like crazy, brutal and unique Storys or you're a Fan of Devil May Cry or God Of War you should buy this one! It's for sure one of sastisfying games I played in this year!

LENGTH : 7 Hour Story

BUGS : Minor

PRICE : Got it for 3€

DIFFICULTY : Medium-Hard

FINAL:

89 / 100

If you like that sort of Review, check out my Profile for more!
Recommending every game over 60

METAL GEAR RISING REVENGEANCE story of a solder who fought in shadows story of the soldier who gave up everything for his country this time it is the legendary RAIDEN. Of course this is the best hack and slash game for me having that Metal gear stealth in it which make this game a masterpiece set after the events of METAL GEAR SOLID 4: GUNS OF THE PATRIOTS this game tell us the unfinished story of RAIDEN. Who eventually came back to the Battlefield after the events of MGS 4 this is the last and final MGS game in the franchise chronologically. And yeah it was a great tribute for RAIDEN A.K.A JACK THE RIPPER IN THIS GAME.

Memories broken, the truth goes unspoken, i've even forgotten my naaaame!
I don't know the season or what is the reason i'm standing here holding my blaaaaaade!
A desolate place, without any trace, it's only the cold wind I feel.
It's me that I spite as i stand up and fight,
The Only Thing I Know For Real,
There will be BLOOOOD-SHEEEED!
The man in the mirror nods his head,
The only ONE! LEFT!
Will ride upon the dragon's back,
Because the mountains don't give back what they take.
Oh no, there will be BLOOOOD-SHEEEED!
It's the only thing i've EVER KNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWN!

Played on Linux using Steam Play Proton 5.0-2.

A nice spin off from the Metal Gear series in which you play as Raiden, a protagonist you've probably already seen in Metal Gear Solid 2 and maybe Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes.

It takes place a few year after the events of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots.

It focuses on slashing through the story with your sword, and I must say that this game is satisfying when you use Free Blade Mode.

Apart from that, the visuals are nice, the soundtrack is awesome and there's a lot of content.

I recommend it if you like the Metal Gear series, even if it's a spin off, it's a nice one.

Rhythm, speed, style and awesome music. MGR is one of the most unique action hack-n-slashes, and one of the most satisfying game experiences ever made. It's awesome to play this again on PC and it will remain a classic.

RULES OF NATURE
Too few are the games available that offer a chance at sliding along the tail of an enormous mechanical robot atop a high-frequency katana screaming 'RULES OF NATURE' at the top of your lungs. Fewer still are those ported to Steam from console platforms with nary a game-breaking issue in sight. And yet, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (MGR:R), first launched on Xbox 360 and PS3 globally during the final weeks of February 2013 is one that has done exactly that.

On January 9th, 2014, the Platinum-Konami lovechild launched near-flawlessly on Steam at a massively reduced price (somewhere in the vicinity of twenty bucks, dependant on your territory and time of purchase) including all 3 DLC sets alongside a host of new graphical options including resolution up to 1080p, 60FPS, gamepad support, anti-aliasing, texture filtering and even the ability to adjust 'ZANGEKI' — the amount of cuts allowed on an object, potentially preventing game crashes or frame rate drops on less capable systems.

I've even read reports on Steam of users testing their system on Can I Run It, with a negative result, that could then, on low settings, play without concern. Impressive, to say the least. But not perfect.

NOT PERFECT?
It's close to perfect, but it's not entirely perfect. For instance, increasing the original FPS to 60FPS is incredible for most gamers, as is the increase in resolution to 1920x1080. Limiting it to 60FPS and 1920x1080, however, is borderline unforgiveable. When moving a title to a new platform, it's important to consider the users of said platform. In the case of PC, 60FPS and 1080p is, for many users, not even playable.

To add insult to injury, there's no Windowed Fullscreen setting forcing many players (and especially Twitch broadcasters like myself) to play windowed to avoid resolution or refresh rate issues. Moreover, there's no V-Sync option, so even if while playing Fullscreen yourself, those watching your broadcast would be forced into an unstable framerate with choppy visuals — something I could only fix by playing windowed.

Even worse still are the cutscenes, which are still limited to 30FPS. Again, this is unlikely to cause an issue for most players, but for some, like myself broadcasting at 60FPS, this means insane screen-tearing and an unpleasant visual experience.

I've been doing some research to determine where these issues are coming from (as, for all intents and purposes my talents lie in playing and critiquing games, not fixing them) and it would appear that the refresh rate not adapting to that of the monitor being used is the underlying cause. Playing in Windowed Mode is the current best fix, though there's a public outcry on Steam requesting a true fix, alongside the addition of V-Sync, WF mode and 120FPS. Here's hoping we get one soon - which is looking likely, as the first patch, to correct the unintended 'always online' function, has already been deployed.

ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW?
I found a great post in the Steam forums by Souzooka that details a bunch of issues I haven't experienced myself, but appear common among the community. Here're the highlights:

Players opting to play with a Keyboard and Mouse (presumably because they don't own a compatible gamepad - it's a console game port, people: use a f***ing gamepad) have run into several issues, including the inability to map key bindings to mouse buttons and 'switch lock-on target', alongside a potentially game-breaking issue with aiming the mounted turret in Chapter 4.

Several users have reported game crashes when failing to read the 'ntdll.dll' file. This appears to happen with users that have no C:/ directory. Others have reported crashes when changing resolution (a difficult task, I might add, as changing any of the graphical settings in MGR:R on PC happens immediately, without the traditional 'Apply Settings' option, meaning you'll need to experience the glory of every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ resolution on the way to 1920x1080 before reaching it, and the same for all other options).

Even more worrying are the reports that many users cannot complete the final boss encounter due to an inability to activate the Quick-Time Event (QTE) associated with it, and too, that many cannot save their game. The latter has been linked to Windows 8.1 users who do not have permission to write to their disk, but is unconfirmed.

If you're experiencing any issues yourself, I recommend checking out Souzooka's post here ; there's plenty of good information, and many fixes for strange occurrences.

MGR vs. MGS
That concludes the PC version of this review, and with MGR:R having been available for almost a year I won't be providing a full review on the game mechanics here — that said, I do want to share my perspective on the inception of this title, for those of you that haven't yet picked it up, and aren't sure if you should.

Which is to say, I want to clarify something: this is not a Metal Gear Solid game. I've come across far too many comparisons between MGR:R and MGS this past year and I'd like to beat that nail on the head right now.

MGR:R was developed by Platinum Games, the team that brought you Vanquish and Bayonetta, both high-octane, adrenaline-fuelled action games demanding quick reflexes and an almost insane level of perseverance. The characters, world and story were provided by Konami, and Hideo Kojima himself, creator of the tactical espionage Metal Gear and Metal Gear Solid franchises on the NES and PlayStation 1-3 (and some off-shoot PSP titles no one cares about).

MGS SPOILER ALERT
It's the answer to a question that Konami have been trying to answer for years: what's it like to play as a Cyborg Ninja? In Metal Gear we were introduced to Frank Jaeger, AKA Null, AKA Grey Fox, AKA The Cyborg Ninja. In Metal Gear Solid, we saw Jaeger in action like we'd never imagined, slicing enemies into pieces with the flick of his wrist and providing some of our fondest memories in gaming history. In Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty we were introduced to Jack, AKA Raiden, a tactical operative similar in style (but not personality) to MGS protagonist, Solid Snake. During the course of Metal Gear history, Raiden was transformed into the Cyborg Raiden we saw in Metal Gear Solid 4: Sons of the Patriots.

Having been transformed from stealth operative to cyborg ninja, Raiden no longer fit as a playable character in MGS (as anyone who has played MGS2 will understand all too well), and given the engine capabilities of MGS presumably never would again. Unless, of course, one of the most notably epic action game developers on the planet teamed up with Konami to make a game specifically suited to that characters' new style, pace and abilities. Then, y'know, it'd be awesome.

It's understandable that many people went into MGR:R expecting MGS — after all, both titles have at least 2 of the same words — but it's not forgivable. You've got the Internet now, people, and me, and a million others like me. Do your f***ing research before you touch the keyboard to whine about how MGR:R is nothing like MGS - when, obviously, if it was like MGS, it would be f***ing MGS, not MGR:R.

The gameplay, the style and the volcanic creativity that can only come from an inspired Japanese studio and I was really missing. Now, for a 11/10 perfect score, bring Bayonetta and Vanquisth to PC, Platinum!

I was ready to hate this game, but Platinum did all the right things with it. The tone is a perfect match for the game, and within that tone the story still manages to take the piss out of American Exceptionalism and various other absurdities and platitudes. This is a less philosophical game than general entries in the Metal Gear Solid series, and takes the philosophy of the series less seriously, joking with it in many cases. This is appropriate, as Metal Gear Solid generally overreaches when it tries to do real philosophy anyway. In place of this, we get to explore the motivations and character of Raiden in a game that greatly expands his personal story arc.

As for the gameplay, I found it very good. Much is based on memorization though. The camera can sabotage you at times, which is obnoxious. Also, play it with a 360 controller. Seriously, find a USB 360 controller online and get one, playing this with keyboard and mouse is a dumb idea. Replayability appeal is limited to the appeal of the hack and slash gameplay and to any perfectionist tendencies a player might have, either towards this gameplay or toward the achievements in the game. I expect to put about 40-50 hours into it and probably never touch it after that.

This is my favorite brawler from the 360/PS3 generation, and it's one of the best games Platinum has made. Period.

Platinum is known for satisfying and stylish combat, crazy bosses, and balls to the walls concepts. Everyone agrees that their brawlers are the best in the business. But to me, they were still held back, not quite there. Their magnum opus brawler, Bayonetta, was filled with large, empty, and uninteresting levels. It lacked control in terms of immersion (IE, the plot, the setting, the world) and let the gimmicks run wild. Too much filler.

But MGR is different, a fantastic display of Platinum's talents reigned in and controlled. Bayonetta gives you a whole 10min stage devoted to riding a rocket into the city, completely useless padding and a way for the developer to pay homage to Space Harrier. But MGR is much more controlled, and much more demanding with these "gimmicks." They feel spectacular, cool for the moment, yet easily discarded for that next set piece, that next spectacle... as if all that unique assets, programming, was no big deal. The fights jump from set piece to set piece, but in a way that seemed organic and entirely fit the battle that you were already dealing with. Not seamless, (ie, Shadow of the Colossus), but close enough that I could ignore the stitching.

The camera is closer to Raiden when compared to Bayonetta, especially in combat. Not the easiest thing in the world when you are sliding, flipping, and slicing spines in half with enemies and protagonists that are as mobile as the ones in here. But somehow, it never felt bad enough for me to throw my controller into the wall. Perhaps it was a necessity for the Zandatsu mode, a mode that lets you cut anything as if you were wielding a sword lightsaber high frequency blade, but I am glad they were pushing for this "zoomed in" combat. You felt more connected to the character. The cuts feel more visceral, the antagonists more awesome. One of the bosses flips you and the camera flips upside down with Raiden. Cool.

The closer the connection, the more demanding the illusion. And this is where the magic starts to break down. The cuts with "Zandatsu mode" never feel gory enough, and the "cutscenes" oftentimes broke the magic of the fight. I played hard mode from the get go and taking a punch was like getting hammered into your skull. But in the cutscene, I see Raiden getting pummeled and coming back as if barely anything happened. It's a jarring disconnect when you see that happen. Perhaps it gels better when it’s in normal mode… but I love the game too much in hard…

And yet, if you can look past these faults, this is genuinely one of the best brawlers of the last generation. It has a great track integrated well into the game. Fights so spectacular that you wish you could relive it over and over again. And antagonists that were properly unique, cool, and memorable. Just the right amount of discussion of self, identity, nationhood, morality for a game branded with the Metal Gear name. Very little stealth element, but let’s be honest, that could have never happened under Platinum’s development.

This is where I felt Platinum was headed. A great honing of their craft to really push the boundaries and the limits of third person brawlers. But taking a quick look at their body of work now... well, I hope they can keep the lights on for long enough for another great gamble. I will be waiting.

On release this game was criticised for not being like all the other games in the Metal Gear Solid franchise. However that doesnt make it a bad game. This game is amazing in its own right, with fantastic music and brilliant gameplay it is a game that allows old and new fans of the previous game to experience the MGS universe with a different viewpoint.
