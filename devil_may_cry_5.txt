Jackpot!

A complete love letter to fans. Ridiculously deep combat, a joyful sense of humor, sick ass soundtrack, and a gorgeous engine makes DMC5 a game deserving of every single praise I can give it and worth every cent.

I simply can't recommend this game enough.

Quick Summary
Devil May Cry 5 (DMC5) is an excellent game that has a very in-depth combat and skills, along with a high skill ceiling. It also sports gorgeous visuals thanks to the RE engine, and various characters that all play differently and keep the whole thing feeling fresh. Environments are varied with hidden secrets, challenges, and alternative routes. The cutscenes are just as high quality as the gameplay itself, with a variety of interesting characters and interesting twists.

Pros
Fantastic graphics and visuals
Great optimization
An absolute banger of a soundtrack, that fits the game perfectly
Huge variety of enemies and bosses
Very in-depth combat system with tons of skills and weapons to unlock and upgrade
Interesting story with unique and memorable characters
Highly replay-able

Cons
One character is very simplistic to play
For new comers, the skills and different characters can be overwhelming
Some of the combat arenas become predictable
Any key skips a cutscene with no warning (including tab + shift for steam overlay)
Camera angle with keyboard and mouse is often janky

Story
*No Spoilers* DMC5 has a pretty interesting story that most players will appreciate after having played the previous games. However, for newcomers, it’s still fairly easy to follow as the game has a fairly lengthy introductory cutscene, along with gradual tutorials that also give you lore at the same time. All of the characters are well developed and playing as different ones at varying times in the story adds a lot to the experience as well.

Having plenty of cutscenes was a nice change of pace from all the murder and mayhem, as fun as that was. Overall, the story in DMC is very well done and ties into the old games, but is still accessible to newcomers (though players would benefit from watching a synopsis at least).

Gameplay
This is where the meat of this game is. And also, where you will take a lot of meat out of demons (because hey, they deserve it). The gameplay in DMC5 is smooth, brutal, and requires fast reflexes. It feels like riding a roller coaster that you’re not wearing a seat belt on… increasingly exciting and invigorating, but if you lose control and thus your groove, you will be punished.

One additional note is that the game seems to encourage multiple playthroughs, since you cannot unlock everything the first time through and you unlock additional modes or further upgrades upon your first campaign completion. The gameplay can roughly be divided into a few categories, though with some overlap: Combat, Skills, Items, and Exploration.

The combat
The combat in DMC5 is essentially third person hack and slash with lots of different combos or skills you can utilize. A very important fact to keep in mind is that combat varies greatly between characters as well, so you can expect a large amount of variety. The battles primarily take place inside a locked arena (similar to Doom 2016) which means there is truly no escape, and you must fight to the death. There are a few roaming enemies throughout the course of the game but most of the battles are very focused, intentional events. Correctly making combo moves and switching up attack styles quickly results in a higher score in your missions, with the highest being “SSS”.

Most combat consists of a primary attack using some sort of melee weapon (like a sword or fists), with a secondary attack that is often ranged (like a revolver or shotgun). Another important element is the “lock-on” feature that lets you concentrate on a specific enemy, and which also acts as a modifier for certain attacks. In addition, enemy attacks can often be countered or dodged with the correct time and combination of keys.

Skills
Branching out from these basic attacks, are skills and movements you can unlock that all can be affected by different keys or buttons. A single primary attack can be totally different by simply using your forward action or reverse action, or holding lock on with a movement key. The upgrade system really goes insanely in-depth here, providing the player the opportunity to really experiment and find the skills they enjoy. Skills are unlocked with red orbs which are essentially in-game currency, that is dropped from kills and can also be found scattered throughout the maps.

As the game progresses, a lot of new and different ultimate skills can be unlocked, that push the combat ability to the max. Depending on the character, some truly devastating powers can be unleashed that knock all but the most powerful demons into bits. These ultimate powers however take time to charge and can be replenished in various but limited ways.

Items
DMC5 also allows item utilization to aid players in beating it. For instance, there are certain orbs you can pick up that restore your health, or permanently upgrade it. One orb will revive you on the spot if you die in a battle. This does however reduce your score level in the mission. There are various weapons and items you can select from before you start a mission, essentially customizing your loadout.

Exploration
Finally, exploration actually plays a pretty significant part in DMC5. For all the vicious combat and lively action, there is a surprising amount of hidden secrets that reveal extra missions or items. Also, there are a few small environmental puzzles that you need to figure out to progress, but they are nothing complicated. Often times, exploration will really help with future battles since you can find important upgrades or even replenish health before a boss.

Graphics and Visuals
Graphics and optimization are where DMC5 really shines. The character faces and animations are impeccable, and the environments are detailed with fantastic atmosphere. The combat is only made better because of this, as there is nothing quite like seeing high resolution demon blood flying across the screen!

Sound
DMC5 has very well-designed audio, with lots of audio cues and combat that provides plenty of feedback. The only audio-related aspect that really stood out in a good way, was the soundtrack. DMC5 frankly has an amazing soundtrack, with really memorable tracks that fit perfectly to the high intensity combat. Another cool detail is the music intensity increases with the score the player racks up during combat. I still find myself playing the songs after completing the game and headbanging along with them.

Bugs, Glitches and Crashes
I did experience one bug with the game. After using Steam overlay, a couple times the game wouldn’t fully recognize my input and so I couldn’t move or switch weapons. I had to reload a checkpoint to get around this. Another technical complaint I have is that the cutscenes will skip with the press of any key, so keep your fingers off the keyboard if you want to watch the cutscenes. However, you CAN re-watch cutscenes from the main menu.

Price… is it worth it?
DMC5 is currently listed at $59.99, which is typical for a newer AAA game. For true fans of the DMC franchise, this price is easily worth it because of how re-playable the game is and a decently long campaign. For newcomers such as myself, I got the game on the most recent sale for $19 which was definitely a bargain for the high-quality experience.

Conclusion
In conclusion, DMC5 seems to be a nearly flawless addition to the DMC franchise with lots of fluid and technical combat, an intense story, and absolutely gorgeous visuals. For someone completely new to the franchise and even to the genre, it is worth picking up on sale and obliterating some demons.

Hey! To whoever reading this, thank you so much! It's not often that I pour this many hours (2,889) into a game, so you know Devil May Cry 5 is truly special! This game, in my opinion, is not only the best Devil May Cry game, but also the greatest character action and hack n' slash game of all time! There isn't a single game that offers nearly as much combat depth as DMC5. There are many ways to extend combos, whether you're airborne, animation/jump canceling to chain different moves together in rapid succession, stance/style switching while juggling multiple weapons, etc.

You truly feel like you have all the freedom to play how you want! The player expression rocks. DMC5 feels like an amazing 3D fighting game actually. The move sets for every character are so huge and expansive, and with the inclusion of mods (I recommend downloading them from Nexus Mods), you'll never get bored and will forever be addicted, captivated, impacted and entertained! Combat for DMC has always been one of its strongest suits, and it's definitely the best it's ever been in 5. The gorgeous RE graphics engine also highlights just how extremely beautiful this game is! Whether you're engaged in the ultra buttery smooth combat or enjoying the awesome cutscenes/story, you can't help but be completely blown away at the level of detail that resides within DMC5.

Capcom truly poured their heart into this love letter of a title, and after waiting what felt like forever (11 years since DMC4!), the wait is truly worth it when you pop this bad boy in. Oh, and be prepared to discover ultimate motivation when you get your hands on Vergil! Vergil is a newly playable character with an incredibly exciting, haunting, and masterful theme to boot (Bury the Light). It's my new favorite song actually. That's another amazing part about this game; the music!

It's so good, that I doubt you'll be using custom soundtracks much. But anyway, that's my DMC5 review! I hope you enjoyed the read just as much as I enjoyed writing it! If you haven't played it yet, don't wait any longer! Bless the entire team at Capcom, along with Hideaki Itsuno-san, for this incredible masterpiece. DMC IS BACK!! We're all eagerly awaiting DMC6 now!!

Overall Score: 9.4 / 10

Quality	9.7/10	　　 　 　 High quality AAA title
Performance	10/10	Flawless; steady 60 fps @ 1080p on ultra
(cloned); ∅ 60 fps @ 4k, medium, AO off
Utility	10/10	No glitches, bugs or crashes experienced;
fair checkpoints; autosave; many options
Controls	9/10	Very good, but clearly meant to be played
with a gamepad; lots of individual combos
for each of the three available characters
Gameplay	9.3/10	　 　 　Spectacular hack-and-slash
Challenge	10/10	Six difficulty levels including instant-death
and limited continues; challenging bosses
with multiple phases and enrage; different
enemy attack patterns, spawns and even
new enemy skills on higher difficulty levels
Content	9/10	~15-20 h for a 100% run (bonus missions,
collectables and cutscenes); ~6 h rushed;
high replayability; future DLCs confirmed
Diversity	9/10	Different protagonists and locations keep
things fresh; ranged mage V's playstyle is
suprisingly innovative, but Nero & Dante
therefore both got huge weapon arsenals
Immersion	9/10	Intense action game with sick soundtrack,
that's hard put down again; in-game MTX
are barely noticable and never advertized
Design	9.2/10	　 　 　 　"Smoking sexy style!"
Visuals	10/10	Beautifully arranged visuals overall; many
HQ cutscenes; crazy moves (+ finishers);
impressively detailed, smooth animations
Sound	10/10	Badass, diverse OST featuring edgy music
genres, that suits the action just perfectly;
high quality SFX & voiceovers (ENG / ♥♥♥)
Texts	8/10	Intricate narration, well written dialogues
and well dozed funny moments; contains
a story summary of all the old DMC titles
& an all-embracing collection of lore docs
Mapping	9/10	Linear levels with little side areas in which
the collectables are hidden; the level size
never felt like a limiting factor though, be-
cause the stages serve as a sequence of
diverse, extensive combat arenas anyway
Interface	9/10	Neat UI overall; old fashioned, traditional
Capcom menu design (simple and clean);
satisfying, somewhat customizable HUD

DMC IS BACK

This and RE2 Remake, I'm glad to see CAPCOM back in shape again.

After 11 years since DMC4 came out. DMC5 proves the series can still be brilliant and imaginative without compromising its longest-held traditions.

This time Capcom sticks to tradition above all else, but also adding a few ambitious new ideas along the way then coat it with the new movie-like graphics and animations thanks to RE Engine. Plus, the WHOLE family is here. you won't be disappointed.

-Best gameplay in the series
-No performance issues on my end whatsoever
-Looks absolutely phenomenal
-Best soundtrack in the series if you get the Deluxe version
-Best point of entry for newcomers (has videos to catch up on the story and the revive+checkpoint system is very forgiving)

-The level design is a bit basic, no gimmicks or puzzles
-V's gameplay is a hit or miss on harder difficulties

Forever grateful that we live in a timeline where DMC 5 exists - Smokin' Sexy Style!!

I NEED MORE POWER!

Introduction

Devil May Cry 5 is a brilliant comeback of the series after 11 years of wait. The game is short like all other entries with a run being around 9-12 hours but those hours are filled with an experience that people had been waiting for more than a decade to enjoy and it's worth it. While the game maintains its usual formula, it introduces new aspects to returning characters and unique playstyles. It makes each of the protagonists diversify their approach to enemies and keeps gameplay fresh even after beating the game. This might be the best Devil May Cry up to date.

Gameplay

Gameplay is a beast, players get to play as three characters: Nero, V and of course Dante. Each of them has their own unique powers, mechanics, and upgrades. There is something for everyone: Nero is like the standard version, he has simple combos, complicated ones and a huge arrange of devil breakers. V is more quiet, like Vergil in previous titles is about dominating the battlefield by keeping different enemies at bay at all times while moving at a slow pace, analyzing what the player faces before jumping in. Finally, Dante is a clear contrast to V, he is crazy, fast and deadly. With an insane amount of weapons and techniques, Dante can do everything which can lead to some amazing-mindblowing combos.

Some Notes

The game is fast paced, more so than previous entries. This makes combat more dynamic but can result in new players dodging more than they should. Some enemies can be very aggressive and tricky to beat but it's all a learning experience. Optimization is great, if you meet the recommended specs you will never fall below 60 FPS, it's solid. Early game can be a little dull but after a couple of hours, all aspects of the game start to shine.

What Makes It Special

The sequel that a lot of people thought would never see the light of the day is here, ready to please both old and new players with a new approach to the series. The game has three branches in the story, one for each protagonist and at times players can choose between which character they want to play as. For the first time, Devil May Cry features online play, with players running into each other and cooperating to beat sections, levels, and even bosses. Bloody Palace is coming as free DLC on April featuring more options for online play and more characters to play as and apparently it includes a fan favorite...

Sum up

+ Wraps a lot of fans speculations.
+ Players can run into each other and play together.
+ Free DLC post-launch, with the bloody palace and more characters.
+ The entry with more moves, combos, weapons, and upgrades in the series.
+ Keep Devil May Cry sense of humor, especially in V's and Dante's branches.
+ The story is dull at first, lacking in the profound element but it acquires that depth later in the story.
+ Each of the characters has their own playstyles, making it easy for players to find one that suits their style.

- Gold orbs can make bosses trivial.
- Some levels can feel like a labyrinth.
- Dante moveset is inconsistent until he gets all his weapons.
- Players who favor either V or Dante can reach a bump when playing as the other.
- At times, the game audio might stop for one second, ruining lip-sync for the rest of the cutscene.

Conclusion

Devil May Cry 5 is the game that fans had waited a good chunk of their life to play. It features smooth gameplay with intricating combos and that possibility of constant improvement, to reach that SSS rank or dominate the game for a section or two. Mastering the game it's rewarding and enhances the experience overall. The story answer long debating question that fans have formulated over the years and the soundtrack while different, suits the series. I dare say this is the best games in the series and a must have for everyone who calls themselves a gamer.

There are a lot of ways to fight in video games, but how many games let you look like an absolute badass while doing it? We have a genre for that (though I’m not sure what exactly we call it), populated with titles like Bayonetta, REVENGEANCE, and of course, Devil May Cry. It’s been a long road for the series to get to this point, but it’s a very, very high point that it’s reached. Combining elements of almost all the previous games, cutting down the story to a central character conflict, and ramping up the action to preposterous heights, DMC 5 really is the culmination of decades of effort, and it shows in every polished, varied piece of the design.

Veteran demon hunter Dante and relative newcomer Nero have been hired by the mysterious V to take on a mission of unusual scope. A massive structure of clearly infernal origin is growing from the heart of a hapless city, and at the center of it is the demon Urizen. Joined by fellow hunters Trish and Lady, and backed up by the rambunctious inventor Nico, the three must battle their way inside the demon tower and put an end to Urizen. But this confrontation is only the beginning of the story, as Urizen’s unusual powers and familiar origin complicate matters. The paths of Nero, Dante, and V will cross, splinter, and combine to form a tale reaching far back into the history of the series, and providing new revelations for its major players.

Let it be known that I’m coming to DMC 5 after playing the original DMC, and the original DMC only. I missed 2, 3, 4, and the ill-fated reboot, and so more than a few references and revelations went straight over my un-stylish head. For folks like me, there is a handy video on the main menu that recaps the previous games (minus 2 and the reboot, which even the developers apparently pretend never existed) and at least fills you in on who the main characters are, if not the nitty-gritty of who killed whose relatives. From my perspective, the series has morphed dramatically over the years, leaving behind the sprawling castle of horrors on Mallet Island for discrete missions along linear paths.

We’ll talk more about levels, but the series has changed in other ways that are huge improvements. The heart of Devil May Cry is the action, and in 5 you are offered three wholly distinct ways to enjoy it in the characters of Nero, V, and Dante. Nero comes equipped with a wealth of tactical options, from his swift sword that can be revved for more damage and special moves, to his mechanical arm that can grapple enemies over to you and be launched for different powerful effects. His style is swift and high-flying, allowing you to continue combos on distant foes and mantle up the largest bosses. In stark contrast, V is a summoner character adjusted for a spectacle fighter. He has one teleport attack used to finish off wounded enemies, and three familiars taken from the bosses of the original game who do the fighting for him. It’s a wholly unique style for a game like this and one I absolutely love, managing an electric bird and a shape-shifting panther while I weave between foes and stab their essence out.

In a rather unexpected move, you don’t really get to play as Dante until about halfway through the game. In retrospect, though, I totally understand why that decision was made. If you thought Nero had plenty of combat options to keep track of, Dante has an incredible amalgamation of weapons, skills, and systems from all of the previous games. He can carry four melee and four ranged weapons, each with extensive skill lists, he has four combat styles that can be switched on the fly and impart new moves for each of his many weapons, he has two Devil Trigger modes that interact with each other, and he has a magic hat he can put on enemies. It can be hard to remember everything he does when you’re trying to parry blows, juggle foes, maintain your combo, and maximize your red orbs, and it seems like after every one of his levels you unlock something new for him.

More than anything though, it’s fun. All the chaos of enemies warping in, locking on and beating one to a pulp, remembering you have guns or rocket launchers, dodging through a storm of blades or countering a mighty slash with your own, every moment of it is thrilling, engaging, and gratifying. There are no real slogs in DMC 5, no fights that drag on too long or foes who take too much damage. Even the bosses lack that infuriating, murderous edge the originals did, with plenty of margin for error on normal difficulty and Gold Orbs on hand to keep you fighting if you’re not worried about your score. The combat is complex enough that you really have to devote yourself to it if you want to keep S ranks and above going, or want to survive more than thirty seconds on the higher difficulties. But for everyone else wanting a flashy, hilarious thrill ride, you won’t have to stress too much.

And what a ride it is! At this point, Dante and friends have perfected the art of unflappable badassery in the face of even the most formidable demons. Every one of them does the casual pace in front of deadly new foes, taunting them as if talking to a particularly unruly punk. The engine brings these characters to life as never before, with an incredible level of detail and realism for the entire cast. Enemy designs are gross and wild, and the environments tend to be just as fantastical with ruined city vistas and pulsating hell tunnels aplenty. The level design does suffer a bit around the halfway point, pulling back to very samey (if colorful) demon halls, but this is also where you get Dante to play with and he’s definitely a high point of the game. And I can’t overlook the music, which is an incredible mix of styles, from rock to classical, that fit the battles and cutscenes in ways you might never have imagined.

It’ll take you about 12-14 hours to crush your way through the game the first time, and after that you’ll have a wealth of difficulties and challenge modes to face if you need more. I’m pretty sure you will, too, whether it be more brutal combos with a motorcycle-sword, more dance numbers with Dante’s magic hat, or more hilariously bleak poetry from hopeless goth V. While DMC 5 approaches the kind of insanity you see in something like Bayonetta, it never quite reaches the same heights, instead choosing to focus on a wide variety of action and a few really choice moments. Even the story ends up being a pretty engaging tale of some of the game’s most memorable characters, rather than another romp to save the world. Devil May Cry 5 is the total package of style, substance, and pure fun that proves this series deserves to stand tall among action games.

First let me be clear, I do NOT like Arena Style games, I've played a few over the years and never enjoyed them. Second I am typically a RPG FPS gamer and if you look at my catalog you'll see the majority of my games reflects an entirely different type of game than the DMC series. The only reason I have this game is I got it for free when I upgraded my graphics card.

OK with that out of the way. DMC 5 is the most incredible game I've played in a long time. I was actually sad to reach the end of the game and sat through the credits and played through them as well and was extremely happy to see the game start over with a few new additions to the menu.

The graphics are excellent,
the cut scenes are entertaining,
the story is well written,
The combat is fast, fun and very responsive,
The game might be a bit short but it just may be me not wanting it to end.
There are Easter Eggs all over the place and great surprises in the game.

Entertaining
Not Boring
Fast Pace
Visually sweet
Responsive mechanics
FUN!

If I could give this game 10 I would. Knowing what I know now I've placed DMC 4 and the other games on my wish list.

I highly recommend this game!

So one day over at Capcom they had a meeting that went something like this:

"So, Mr. Jeff DmC, what did you want to discuss in this meeting?"
"Here's an idea, John Capcom? How about we make a videogame that is just very good? No more, no less, no strings attached, just a kick ass game?"
"Brilliant idea Jeff, we'll begin development post-haste. Oh, and don't forget to include the best soundtrack known to man alright?"
"You got it John!"

And they did just that. Godspeed Capcom and The Devil May Cry Crew.

I can say that this game is GOTY contender. Hack 'n' Slash gameplay is very satisfying. But there are some aspects that need tweak to be sexier.

D (Dismal)
Load and load of loading. While the shopping screen is fine. I hate it when I want to test the move it took time to load the testing area and then when I want to try other move I have to go back to shopping screen and wait for it to load again. But yeah. this is very minor annoyance but I wish I didn't have to spend that much time on character upgrade screen because of loading.

C (Crazy)
While I've seen worse camera in beat'em up game. This game still have some camera issue that come up with it's control. Make some platforming challenges somewhat harder (Thankfully they are optional). And sometime make it hard to have a decent vision on enemies during battle in packed spaces.

B (Badass)
The story is alright... It took interesting turn in the midgame. And then when things got climatic it swoop down to ending.

A (Apocalyptic)
Still I have to say that I like most of character interaction in this game they are very charming, especially Nico. V. is also kinda nice but I wish they get something more out of him.

S (Savage)
This game feature variety of move and fightning styles even for one character. Even V who has the least variety of move is still very fun to play as.

SS (Sick Skills)
Boss fight. They are balance and not overly overwhelming in normal difficulty. Boss fight in many beat'em up games often come with some obscure features that you have to no clue what, when or where to hit which could be annoying for someone who just want a quick challenge. But not in this game they are very clear of what and when you should hit them. And the rest is up to your reflex skill.

SSS (Smokin' Sexy Style)
Graphics are top notch. Animation and effect make satisfying hack 'n' slash gameplay. If it tweak some control it would be perfect.

After 11 years, DMC has come to take the throne back.

My absolute favorite in the series, elevating every entry that came before it with it's emotional storytelling and unforgettable moments, with a tight, diamond cut fighting system with more depth and variety than ever before, made on Capcom's REngine which is absolutely gorgeous, the way character's facial expressions change and hair moves around mid gameplay, spectacularly intricate particle systems, an impressive roster of distortion and lighting effects perfectly mixing the over the top action with the often morphing, surreal environments and photorealistic visuals.
And it runs like a dream on PC, even on launch day.

I would have never imagined that a new DMC game would be able to out shine it's classic predecessors, but Capcom managed to do just that, solidifying the series as the king of the genre it created, directed by the man who perfected it.
They made this game for the fans, and it shows.

900 hours clocked in now, game is still sick hoho merry christmas


Vergil DLC - WORTH THE DAMN 5 BUCKS. Like seriously, I thought we were going to just get a Boss Vergil with just some less awkward movement controls but nah, it's a full blown complete Vergil w/ 3 weapons, more moves & taunts compared to his old iterations. Also i'm happy for M19 - M20 and the new cutscenes are like sick af, but pre rendered hold em little bit back :sadge:


(Updated some stuff below)

Story -

Pros
- If you want the FULL story experience, read the Before the nightmare novel first. It makes the story even more fleshed out and gives so much context to the story and has little dialogues that can't be find in the game.

Visions of V is a MUST read after DMC5's story, it's pretty much how most of the cutscenes would have went if DMC5 were given more budget LuL AND we get to see an actual prequel of dante & vergil as kids, exploration of Vergil/V's psychology before & during the events of DMC5, and shows how redgrave city went down during the invasion, and also the DMC5 Artbook to get some context on some locations and etc.

- You might emotional in the ending
- It got some sick ass small subtle details on cutscenes
- A LOT of callbacks from the old games
- Cutscenes are top notch
- Music has a lot of sick tracks

Cons
- Some Qlipoth levels are bit meh, but other than that, everything looks good imo.
- I like everything about the story, my only gripes w/ it is that it lacks some cuhrazy choreographed fights on some cutscenes when compared from DMC3 - 4 (Vergil DLC sorta fixed this because good lord the action on those new cutscenes are PERFECTO), the ending was a bit rushed, and kinda got annoyed some mistranslations on some dialogues but that's just how most ♥♥♥ games getting localized roll these days.

Gameplay -

Pros
- What I like about it is that the animations are sick, the details on some weapons are really cool, taunts are SSS tier, buster animations are still satisfying af, the game's combat is still deep af, it brings new good ♥♥♥♥ in the table, it gave dante new weapons, new mechanics, and for Nero, he has 8 devil breaker arms, new moves from his existing moveset, and a new mechanic too. V is the most interesting to play as, but I wished he was more fleshed out and was given more moveset and summons.

Cons
- If you are an advance player from dmc3 and dmc4, you might find some mechanics underwhelming or dumbed down. Enemy step has an animation cooldown now and the timing is no longer strict, you can spam jump and attack and get some consistent jc attacks, no inertia, no reversals, and some moves have a lot of recovery like royal guard and etc.
- Where. Is. My. Turbo. Mode.
- I wish there was more options for the player to tinker around like removing/lessen camera shake, no slow mo's, remove hud, and etc.
- Make the final boss a lot more aggressive pls :(

(None of these combat cons are still fixed aside from Turbo after Vergil DLC or DMC5SE sad leyf)

Graphics -

Beautiful. AF.

I love this game, don't buy it. Unless Capcom stops treating us like dirty second class citizens that don't get the Special Edition despite overwhelming fan support for the game on PC and two years of free advertising with all our combo videos and mod showcases. I can't believe I bought all the DLC for this game to then get slapped across for being a good customer.

It's an absolutely amazing game, and I love it, however I can't recommend new players buy this game as it's inferior to the Special Edition that is apparently going to be console exclusive. If you want to get the definitive DMC5 experience, you're better off getting that version as opposed to this version.

This is my first DMC, and admittedly, it shouldn't have been.

The story is simple enough, but I feel as though a better connection and understanding would more at grasped if I played the previous entries. Other than that, combat is stylish and intense. Only downfall, to me at least, is that I found myself when surrounded by enemies, targeting only one. I wish there were more moves to counter being surrounded, perhaps there is, but most of the moves I saw and unlocked only called for locking onto one specific target. Story is okay, like again, I'm sure if I played previous DMCs, it would be more satisfying to journey through. Visuals are outstanding and the optimization is fantastic. The soundtrack is epic and unforgettable, so crank it all the way up.

Overall, I only recommend this game to players who have played other DMCs in the past. I wish I did, it would make my experience much more enjoyable, but still recommending it because it's a neat and fun game.

I was one of the very few people who liked 2013's attempted reboot, despite its edginess, but my god, what a true return to form this game is. A Devil May Cry for the modern age at last.

Good game. Too bad they (so far) don't intend to upgrade the PC version to have the SE features. I don't even care about Raytracing but LDK and Turbo mode should not be locked out.

PC will not be able to purchase Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition

The Special Edition includes over the base game:
> Playable Vergil
> Ray Tracing Support
> Legendary Dark Knight difficulty (adds several more enemies in a dynasty warriors fashion)
> Turbo mode
> (more apparently yet to be revealed)

We get 25% of the new content (playable Vergil) that consoles will be getting despite having supported the release of the game from launch. In addition, it seems that Vergil has NO new weapons and just copies his boss moveset. We have had mods for ages that add these features, even playable Vergil to a lesser extent, yet apparently, it can't be added in an update.

DMC4SE had 3 new character, costumes for everyone, new difficulty modes and more. The fact of the matter is that Capcom will ALWAYS hold back Devil May Cry games and stick on Vergil later and expect us to praise them for minimal effort. No matter if you show your support on PC, fill in their stupid surveys, and do everything to have them recognize the platform, they NEVER will. Don't give them a single cent.

Short: I was unable to play any 3d combat game without feeling like it's somewhat bad after playing this game. It literally ruined my taste in combat by being so stylish.

I came into this series almost blind, just into this game. The story made sense in a weird way, it's made so that a new player will feel as if they just came into this world that has it's own story running (which is how Nero, the main protagonist, feels like).
It's short, but man is it worth it. Replay value is high with wanting to both improve yourself, replaying the story, replaying on a higher difficulty, playing the Bloody Palace (Fight 101 rooms of enemies to unlock a spicy taunt), playing as the DLC character which is all the previous things but again.

My problems:
-It's rather short.
-The story, despite ending nicely, makes you want more.
-The multiplayer system is interesting, but it being only a major thing in two missions and you being instantly disconnected if you open the menu kind of sucks. I wish the next game has co-op for all the missions for even more replay value.
-The cutscenes will skip if you press any button, while not being a problem for replays it can be annoying on the first.
-The DLC character, despite being great, could have been better with one move. And he only got one and a half new bosses instead of 2 unique bosses.

OST, amazing.
Graphics, amazing.
Me, motivated.

Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a tight action game whose campaign moves as quickly as its excellent combat. It’s all killer, no filler, with more than enough incentive for repeat play-throughs.

Let me get this out of the way. Devil May Cry 5 is a great game. well polished well optimize. even runs ok on low end PCs with the right settings of course. my complaint is this game hasnt been updated in almost a year but yet on Consoles the PS5 and Xbox Series X are getting new difficulty modes a turbo mode and ray tracing reflections. why isnt this same care being applied to the PC version. why arent these features and new modes being added to the PC version. PC players are gamers as well and we paid the same price as console players. why the favortism for Consoles

Super fun game, I mean it's DMC, you can juggle your opponents to death and beyond or even german suplex them, but now with way better movement and graphics over the past entries. It also worked perfectly in a GTX 1660 I had before, and I've experienced no remarkable bugs.

Despite the recent reviews regarding the DMC5SE not coming to PC, that doesn't mean this game is bad, not at all. This game was complete since day 1, and they promised a bloody palace mode (which is already in the game) the day it was released, so that's extra stuff. They said there were no other plans to add more content, but here we are receiving Vergil as DLC when DMC5SE gets released (which did not happen with DMC4 and DMC4SE, and it's still a great game). In addition, just like with Vergil, they never said we won't actually get the Special Edition on Steam in the future, we have both DMC4 and DMC4SE on Steam right now, so please don't believe the recent bad reviews, it's just that we're living in 2020 now and complaining has become an e-tradition. This game works flawlessly and is complete right now, and with Vergil it will be even better.

(In any case if some people were to complain it'd be PS4 and XBOne owners, PS3 got the original version of DMC4, but the Special Edition went straight to PS4, with no Vergil DLC in the original or mods *shrug* )

This was my GOTY 2019 for a couple of reasons. Honestly, there's not much to say that hasn't been said already about it, it is definitely Devil May Cry, back at its best, I'd even go as far as to say this is THE BEST dmc game ever made (ask me that in about 10 years from now, we'll see). Got my hopes up for more like this, definitely a great purchase, and an amazing game.

Oh? reviewing, right... So, gameplay, hack'n'slash done right, Every Combo is really satisfying, although i would say you get SSS ranks really easily this time around (V is the SSS mash buttons to win character for sure)

Music is really awesome as well. At first i was kinda distracted by the main song being a bit different, but it fits so well, and it's so good, it's on my playlist for when I go out to jog!

Graphics are RE Engine, very lifelike, pretty colors but kinda dark. Sets a good tone for the story and its characters.

And characters? Well, Deadweight Nero is back, and more badass than ever! V is a solid new addition, sometimes almost comical how much goth he is, kinda reminds me of the goth kids in South Park. Don't really need to talk about Dante, right? Main man of the franchise, he's the same good OLD Dante, in every way of the word, really. he's really old now.

Not much downsides I can see here if i'm honest, you'll want a nice pc to run this game to its perfection, Combos are easier to pull off, I guess hardcore fans may not like that ? I really don't remember playing this and going:: "that really sucks" at any point in the game.

I highly recommend this game, even for newcomers of the series, cause why not! i'm just really happy for Devil May Cry to be back and better than ever.

A True successor that can stand tall among side the other titles in the great saga known as Devil May Cry !!
At first missions felt a bit easier compared to previous DMCs (started at demon hunter difficulty off the bat) but it gets more challenging later on ! The combos and the SSStyle Hunting is at its peak once again. To put it simply without spoiling :

- Gameplay rocks , with many skills/upgrades for all chars to purchase and many many combos to be discovered and executed ! Different characters to choose from ,that have totally different play styles. Much Depth such Wow
- Story is neat, cinematics are effin' awesome and model acting is right on spot. The spicy & swag-smack talk remains alive Bully and get bullied by demons!
- Music is SSSmokin hot!
- Has unlockable secret missions , diffuculties , mission and (possibly) more !! Great replayabilty if you up for it.
- 
- Runs Great (at least if you meet recommended req. specs)

I might come back to update the review , just to add a few more sections when i play it some more !!

Final Verdict
At least : Fabulous/10

Do you recommend this game?
Hell yeaaaaaaah !!!!

Unless Capcom stops treating us like dirty second class citizens that don't get the Special Edition despite overwhelming fan support for the game on PC and two years of free advertising with all our combo videos and mod showcases. I can't believe I bought all the DLC for this game to then get slapped across for being a good customer

Nico spin-off please

I'm not a fan of such games, i'm too old for this ♥♥♥♥, I just can't keep up with extremely fast gameplay anymore. But I loved it and i'll try to be unbiased here.
I didn't like previous DMC title. Although it was developed by one of my favorite studios I couldn't get into it. Not because I struggled or anything, it just felt boring and besides soundtrack i couldn't see anything good in it. Now DMC 5 is whole different thing. Bought because of good graphics and i was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable this game is.

The story is simple but pretty interesting for such game. Of course there's a lot of crazy over the top moments and humor. Everything action game should have story-wise.
Character design is great, especially Nico, damn she's hot. All 3 main characters are bad-ass how they should be.
Gameplay is practically a non-stop action with crazy moves and combos with occasional high quality cut-scenes. There are 20 levels and 3 characters to play with. For most of the game you can't choose your character so you play with either Nero, Dante or V. Some levels let you choose the character. If I recall correctly one level lets you choose from 3 and two more levels lets you choose from 2 characters.
Each character is different, has different fighting techniques, skills and moves. So basically every single level feels fresh because you either unlock new fight moves/skills or play with a different character. You will never get bored playing this game.

Fighting requires quick reaction and reflexes, the game is fast. You can execute all kinds of combos and attacks to smash the enemies which requires skill. But dear casual friends don't worry, there's a noob/casual mode and difficulty levels for you so that basically anyone could play the game. Noob mode how I call it does combos and fighting for you. What you need to do is mash the buttons randomly and the game connects those into effective attacks so you don't need to worry about remembering button combinations and such. As I said great fro slower people like me or ones who want to get used to the game first.
Speaking of enemies. The enemy design is amazing. Great selection of all kind of enemies, from small and fast, flying and
crawling, hard hitting and hard to hit.

Level design is pretty good. In the first half of the game every level is different and environments change each time. But later into the game levels become kinda samey. They're still fun to run and hack'n'slash through but it's not the same variety as in the first half of the game.

Graphically the game is a real eyecandy. Monsters, characters, especially in cut-scenes look stunning. Can't get enough of cut-scenes with Nico. Need more Nico. Please Capcom more Nico next game.
Environments on the other hand are not great. They still look good, nothing close to being ugly. I guess this is done to keep the performance good because it matters in a fast paced game. And speaking about performance it's great. The game ran at 90-100fps the whole time with no problems. Playing on 3440x1440 so a pretty high resolution on 7700k and 2070s. The performance is top notch.
Sadly no ultrawide support out of the box so you need to use a fix. After that the game runs flawlesly in ultrawide.

Sound design is done well too. Voice acting is great and soundtrack is amazing. Lots of good electronic and industrial tunes. Although I miss Combichrist.

Overall a great action game for casuals and hardcore fans. It may be easy it may be extremely challenging because of variety in difficulty settings so pretty much anyone into action games more or less should like it. Bad ass characters, over the top action and Nico makes this one of the best action games out there.

Pros
Each level feels fresh (for the most part)
Non-stop action
Good monster variety
Great character design
Did I mentioned Nico?
Soundrack
Amazing graphics
Could be challenging or extremely easy depending on your choice
Cons
Level variety is bland in the second half of the game

Smokin' Sexy Style!!
I fell in love with the game after watching the reveal trailer. When I finally got to play it, I wasn’t disappointed at all. Devil May Cry 5 is a very stylish hack and slash game. It’s got all what it needs: juicy action, badass music, top-notch graphics, and even a cool story with a few twists.

The visuals in the game are awesome. The characters look attractive, the enemies are highly detailed, and the animations are very smooth. The battles are pleasing not only to take part in but also to watch. I have a single concern about the design of the locations—they look a bit monotonous. Though, they still fit in the game. After all, the world is at the edge of the apocalypse, so it shouldn’t be pretty and colorful.

I can talk about the combat system forever. The variety of the combos is sure to keep you entertained. Dante has several fighting styles and weapons, Nero has various Devil Breakers, and V introduces the new pet system. Each of the characters has a unique playstyle that you’ll have to master to turn up the difficulty. The game will push you towards improving your skills. If you’re persistent enough, eventually you’ll be able to kill the most vicious demons at the highest difficulty while enjoying the SSS stylish rank.

The soundtrack is totally badass. The three character themes will get stuck in your head, whereas the other songs are not so catchy but still cool enough. As I’m a metal music fan, I really admired Subhuman.

The plot was never a forte of hack and slash games, yet in Devil May Cry 5 it’s quite exiting. You’ll definitely become a fond of it if you’re a DMC fan. In case you’ve never played any DMC games before, I recommend getting familiar with them first so that you can fully appreciate the story.

Devil May Cry 5 turned out to be a high-quality product. I enjoyed it all the way through. If you’re into hack and slash games, then Devil May Cry 5 wil certainly become one of your favorites.

After 130.5 hours of pure addiction, stylish combos, and 100% of the achievements, I can now honestly say my opinions on this game.

DMC 5 is a TRUE MASTERPIECE for all the games of the Hack 'n Slash "tag". Its incredible on how much variable this game's gameplay is. We have 3 characters with their on style of combat: The LEGENDARY Dante from the past games, the "kid" Nero that was the MC from the past game and then V, with a really distinct form of gameplay.
Dante's gameplay is as good as his character: badass and stylish. Nero's gameplay its a improved and more fluid from dmc 4 game, with more precise timings and have some more variants thanks for his devil breakers. V's gameplay is kinda fun, and is a original kind of gameplay. The boss battles in this game are all lit asf, they fit perfectly with the DMC area. The whole dmc5 gameplay is worthy for the "Best action game" award.

The story is also good asf, we have plenty of nostalgia from dmc 1 and 3 in particular. It have a really nice plot envolving Nero and And, in my opinion, dmc5's story is the most complete story from the whole saga. That even makes me afraid if will have a dmc6 or not. (I really hope so)

Hahaha, I don't even need to tell ANYTHING about the ost. Literally ALL OF THEM its so freaking cool, my personal favorites are Devil Trigger, Subhuman, The Time has Come Remix and The Duel. Honestly? I don't even know how Death Stranding have won the "Best Game Soundtrack" award, because dmc5's soundtrack is AMAZING.

In general, this is 2019 game of the year for me. Capcom should give dmc more love, RE2 remake didnt won anything in the game awards, dmc almost won 2 of them! Capcom, GIVE DMC MORE LOVE. This franchise is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing dude. And this game is definitly a worth buy from anyone who likes games like this.

This is the only Devil May Cry game I’ve played besides DmC: Devil May Cry (that’s such a weird name. Devil May Cry x2?). I haven’t even completed DmC either. This is the only Devil May Cry game I’ve completed, and I loved every moment of it. I’m going to break it down and list the reasons what I disliked and liked about this game.

One of the first things I want to say is that I played this game with an Xbox One controller and only paid $20 for this. I may be biased, as I didn’t pay full price. However, I feel that it is worth that.

How does it look?
Devil May Cry 5 is one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played. There’s so much detail done to every little thing that they put into this. You can tell the team was very passionate about what they were creating. The cutscenes were absolutely stunning and some of the most memorable cutscenes I’ve ever witnessed. There’s even an extra option to go back and watch the cutscenes. I did this several times just to look at how pretty and badass they were. Seeing Dante shred through demons, Nero using Red Queen and his new Devil Breakers, and V using his staff and companions to shatter enemies. It’s all very satisfying to watch and rewarding.

How does it sound?
This is the part where Devil May Cry 5 lost me. I know that several people that loved the soundtrack and several people that had the opposite opinions. Unfortunately, I’m one of those people. The soundtrack seems like it was made for children (this is my opinion). Some ambient music was great, but the theme songs for the characters (looking at you, Devil Trigger) took me out of the game. I just ended up having my own music in the background while I played. I’ve found that the soundtrack doesn’t really fit the game. It has more of an electronic/metal theme to it, but it’s just not as good as everything else this game offers. It usually just makes me laugh or cringe. Again, no offense to the people that liked it. Have a listen to the soundtrack for yourself on Spotify or YouTube. You may very well like it.

How does it play?
The Devil May Cry franchise has always been good about delivering a satisfying combat experience. The thing is, if you aren’t good with timing - you won’t have a good time. This game requires a little bit of skill, as things are about timing and setting yourself up for combos. Devil May Cry 5 gradually shows you how to do these pretty gradually and helps you get into the flow of what this game is. Once you get your preferred combos and weapons selected; this is where the game shines the brightest. Being able to lay into these demons and show them that you’re superior is one of the best feelings I’ve ever felt in a video game. If you love satisfying combos with a side of challenge, this game is perfect for you.

How is the story?
To be honest, I haven’t kept up with the Devil May Cry story. I didn’t know who all of these people were when I started playing. However, it did a great job of letting me know who was who and why they were so significant. I’ve grown to care about all of the characters and learn about who they were and what their motivations were. Devil May Cry 5 does a great job with character dialogue and interaction. Seeing these characters talk and fight seems pretty realistic and is often really cool. Seeing the characters react to their emotions and see how they actually feel is really refreshing.

Overall...
I highly recommend this game, even if you don’t typically like 3rd person games. Capcom knew what Devil May Cry 5 needed to offer, and they perfected it. Beautiful visuals, satisfying combat, and an amazing story. Please pick up this game whenever you can afford it. You won’t regret it.

I'm really tired of having to deal with the DENUVO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, therefore, I'm not going to recommend DMC5 on PC. Don't get me wrong, the game is amazing, probably the best DMC game of them all (I'm serious), but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that Capcom has pulled off with DENUVO on PC it's just too much.

Capcom released this game by mistake with a DENUVO-less exe, then, released a patch to put DENUVO back in. That allowed people to notice how the game ran faster, better, without FPS drops, lag, stutter and much faster loading times without DENUVO.

I don't support piracy but DRM is not the solution. You only need one example to understand this: CD Projekt RED. Hard work, dedication, costumer respect and releasing quality products is what fights piracy.

Pirates are playing this game for free while us, the legit costumers, have to deal with online checks while we play that eat up CPU power, increasing loading times and generating FPS drops.

So no, I don't recommend DMC5 on PC, despite being the best DMC game ever.

It's so fun.
I've tried DMC on PS2, but since I didn't know much English back then I didn't know what was the story or anything and I also didn't play the game that long, just a couple of hours.
The only thing I know is Dante is the main character.

Is this game worth it? absolutely!
I find the voice acting really cool, especially the English one.
I usually use Japanese dub on games if it's available, but on DMC5 I love listening to the English dub more.

Devil May Cry 5 is a stellar return to form for the series, capitalizing on all the elements that make it great. Charismatic characters and stylish, over-the-top fighting mix together into an experience that keeps you hooked to your seat for the initial 15+ hours, and possibly more as you delve into higher difficulties. With very little beating around the bush, and a combat system that’s easy enough to grasp but takes a while to master, the title successfully pushes you to learn its combos, while providing an awesome power trip. Gorgeous and intense, Devil May Cry 5 is an unbridled serving of the purest form of action that few other titles pull off quite as well. Full Review[www.gamewatcher.com].

Great game, interesting story, graphics are very good, amazing performance. But there is some really annoying problems.
If you have HDR monitor the game forces it even if you don't have HDR on in windows. To fix this you have to change to windowed mode and back to fullscreen and that for some reason turns HDR off lol. Then the most annoying bug is that out of nowhere your keyboard / mouse stop registering for no reason. And only fix for that is to restart the game.

Amazing game, wish there was more after the story mode aside from an endless mode. Almost cried my eyes out after beating it.

Playing it is way better than doing any sort of drug.

10/10. Most fun I've had in years with a video game.

Vergil's human half enlists the help of Vergil's brother and Vergil's son and their friends in his quest to defeat Vergil's demon half, in order to become Vergil again, after he cast aside his humanity in pursuit of power, trying to overcome the trauma of being Vergil. Vergil May Vergil 5 is a solid action game with very good soundtrack, my favorite being Vergil's theme. So, if you like action, you should buy this game, if you like music, you should buy this game, if you like Vergil... you should buy this game.

11/10 - Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry™ series.

One of the best Hack & Slash games I ever played, Capcom delivers an over the top game with 3 playable characters and each have a totally difference arsenal and combos and also different gameplay, it's not just different skins.

Easy to play but hard to master, a controller is a must, this game isn't made for Mouse/Keyboard especially if you are you playing on the harder difficulties

Highly recommended for fans and non fans of DMC & this genre in general.

It just feels so dirty when Capcom attaches red orb DLC so you cannot refund this game, it is also bad that they do not offer deluxe upgrade pack and you cannot buy DLC separately, so if you want one of these DLCs, then you have buy all of them. a very dirty way to do business, Capcom.

easily the best hack and slash of all time and i think you can play this game for 5k hours and still be willing to do so again. 4 playable characters with each having their own unique style of playing, dynamic music playing through the game, absolutely badass battle tracks, good variety of enemies and ...

i could keep complimenting the game and there'd still be things left untold. best game ever.

EDIT :

Still the best of the best of the best

I waited 10 years to play this game. The last DMC game from Capcom was in 2008.
And starting the game, holding your gamepad, and just loading into the title screen made me scream like a kid.

Lets start off with some basics that Capcom or DMC series never fails to impress me:

+ Combat - Yup, this is it, the pinnacle of hack and slash , all at the same time making your characters COOL AF while performing them. If you're an anime fan, you'll be right in the shoes of your power fantasy. The combat system is quite hard to get used to, at first and a lot harder to master, so pulling off those sick moves will make you grin like the grim reaper. But wait, there's also an "Auto" mode that enables complex combos to be chained with the press of buttons, if you're interested in an easier gameplay, but you lose the finer control on chaining the right combos.

Nero : The moves are so fluid, every time i played Nero, i paused each move just to see that they didnt even cut corners in the animations. Nero's devilbringers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.... to see the intricate details of an arm that's mostly not even visible when in combat, is just amazing. You can see all the animations for each arm being unique and right, The gameplay mechanics integrated into that arm alone kept me just trying them out in open spaces again and again. The sword and gun play is as expected from Nero, Smooth and consistent, you never are afraid when being surrounded by enemies. They went overkill with the eXceed mechanic with a certain devil bringer, the red queen glows in fiery red exhausting flames and there's visible heatwaves surrounding it. Also, Nero is still cheesy and cringe-worthy as usual.

V : Playing V is the power fantasy of those that love the master-minion theme. Dude has the charisma of Daila Lama and the edgy attitude of an anime villain. You stand far back, you let your demonic pets do your job and they equate to a snarky hawk that spews electricity and a silent shapeshifting panther that can turn into any weapon that kills, then there's a giant golem that he can summon that fires death beams, so yea. Playing V is like conducting an orchestra, You press buttons, and the right buttons at the right time makes death rain on your foes. Just a joy as most hack and slash games have never had such an implementation where the character himself isn't involved as much. Again brilliant gameplay and character design, oh and did i mention, he READS A BOOK WHILE IN BATTLE to charge his ultimate?! His alluring charm also attracts all weebs to rise up and say "Yare Yare Daze".

Dante : Yo, this is the OG in my heart when it comes to hack'n'slash games. As we've all grown(DMC fans), Every adult has wanted a game character that not only is super strong and powerful, always saving the world and etc, but also at times weak, vulnerable , desperate and the raw desire to claim the "COOL AF" title and Dante is it. This mofo is the jack of all demonic trades, his controls,weapon sets, combo moves are some of the best in the FREAKING GAMING INDUSTRY. It was a sheer adrenaline rush every time you started combat with Dante. Capcom made a motorcycle into a freaking dual chainsaw, If you people remember your favorite weapons from DMC 3 and 4, well Spolier alert: . Overall 10 years of wait was totally satisfied when controlling this badass mofo. Every weapon mechanic while in combat is the extension of Dante's attitude which is an amazing feeling to capture and portray to players, so kudos Capcom.

+ Character Design - All the characters in the game are so well designed especially now that the game uses RE6, everything looks so much better. Even though the game will ride off its combat loop more, characters are still flushed out especially for a hack and slash game. Enemy and boss design are cool, but you wont be noticing them when you're launching them into the stratosphere and due to fast pace of each encounter.

+ World Design - Capcom isn't new to this world ending scenario nor are they not aware of how level designs work for hack and slash games. Tight linear areas with room to show off your moves, nothing complex and keeping you progress forward. Although this is first DMC that has been generous with the red orbs, its almost everywhere. RE6 engine provides nice backdrops and everything feels as expected.

+ Story - Well, as a fanboy and someone whose been playing all the DMC games till now, it was quite satisfying but not exhilarating to be honest, but quite satisfying is a high note for these type of games. First time players would be more disappointed as they would not feel the same connection to the storyline or characters. Imagine watching a soap opera from Season 3 instead of 1, You'll enjoy it but you wont get the full picture. There is a short reminder of the events of DMC in game, so that could help.

So for DMC fans, this game is a must play and most you would have pre-ordered just like me. And for the newer players, its an experience you rarely find in the gaming industry, a fun and thrilling roller coaster ride that can reduce your irl stress by button smashing(or calculating moves) and looking cool at the same time. You will not be disappointed. I hope this review was a good read.

Final Verdict:

11/10 for combat and 8/10 for Story = 9/10 for the game.

Edit:
forgot to add my budget specs: i5 4440, GTX 1060 6GB and 16 GB RAM. Game ran locked on max settings 60fps@1080p. And if you're wondering about the hours shown, i finished it on console and replaying it on PC. It takes about 20 hrs to complete the story and even more if your doing everything besides just the story.

Well well well, the Vergil DLC is here.

Vergil :
The alpha and omega of the series, it is truly a marvel seeing Vergil dominate the battlefield with such finesse. The weapons and moves reflect this ideology that less is more and calm is deadly. If anyone has played DMC4, this will feel like putting on familiar gloves in terms on control.
So every time I did some flashy moves or used DT on vergil, I recorded my gameplay, viewed it in half the playback speed and the details are all there. Just beautiful. A reminder that the new dlc isn't something of a new story, it's more of the same story with some added stuff here and there.

I love this game to bits, even bought it three times (PS4, PC, and PS5), but I will say right now that the PC version CAN be the best version... if you learn how to mod the game. You'll get an experience that Exceeds (heh) the next-gen versions. Sure you might not have raytracing (yet?), but Turbo Mode and Legendary Dark Knight are 100% possible, not to mention the plethora of gameplay adjustments and fixes available from the modding community to customize the game to fit your playstyle and your aesthetic.

Did I mention there's also a functioning online co-op mod? Yes, said mod is janky and needs the stars to align to work cause Capcom didn't account for the networking system to be used this way at all, but when it works it's some of the most dumb fun I've had with any game in ages. Also they just figured out how to get co-op LDK to work and it's crazy as all butt.

What I'm trying to get across here is that it's frustrating that Capcom has the power to support this game in many ways imaginable but choose not to. I get why the PS4 and Xbox One can't get updated with most of Special Edition's new additions, but not PC? Really now? It sucks that we have to rely on modding for some of those features, but honestly it's still impressive as all hell that the community loves this game enough to make all this cool stuff for us to try out that you can't get anywhere else.

Seriously, I loved the base game as is, but modding it has changed it into some life-changing ♥♥♥♥. I've put in 45+ more hours into this version of the game since modding it and I plan to put in much more until I somehow get bored. I don't wanna be all "durrrrr fans do what Capcom don't", and I'm not trying to be, but I just want to say that the DMC community has the power to put out some amazing work that increases the longevity of these games tenfold, so if you love DMC and want to break the limits on its already amazing gameplay, I highly suggest looking into all the cool additions and adjustment some modders out there are working on, it's truly incredible stuff.

If you are someone who as a kid, was watching early 2000's action movies like Matrix trilogy or Blade trilogy, and dreamed to play a game that would let you feel like main protagonist of films mentioned above, then look no further - this is something for you.

This is a game that you should try and see for yourself if you like it. Story is decent, main characters are iconic at this point (Dante/Vergil), music is awesome and so are visuals, but the gameplay is just something else. Gameplay alone sells this game. Combat is flashy and extremely fun, especially if you are willing to take ur time and learn it in depth. I can guarantee that you'll feel satisfied after completing the game just once and leave it at that, or fall in love enitrely and complete it on harder difficulties as well. Also, you don't need to play previous games to understand story or anything like that, you can find a history recap here, that tells you in brief what happened in older games.

Just grab it when you can, it's THAT good. Deluxe edition recommended for DMC fans.

I'll be honest, the only DMC title I'd played prior to this one was the reboot, and I've been completely blown out of the water by how much of a jump in quality DMC5 has been compared to that. It may not be devoid of problems, but few games are, and if someone asked me for a standout example of a character action game I'd point to this without hesitation.

The Gameplay

Controls are responsive and incredibly easy to learn, even on M/KB, so players both old and new to action games will be able to quickly get a handle on using their full moveset. Though you have a ton of actions at your disposal, they're carefully introduced over the course of the first few levels, helping the integration of each into your tactics remain smooth. In lieu of a light/heavy attack system, the buttons are instead divided by melee/ranged/special, with directional inputs, button holds, or mid-combo delays being how you perform various moves. This system let them pack a ton of moves into each weapon without an excess of buttons, but it hits a bit of a snag should the camera ever decide to turn unexpectedly. While a move's input may be listed as W + Left Click while locked on, what it -actually- means is press whatever direction is towards the enemy you're locked on to. As a result, if you knock a foe around and the camera turns to keep them in view, all of the directional inputs are shifted, and it can be quite awkward to try to adjust to this mid-combo.

Movesets sport a ton of variety, letting you constantly mix up your attacks and ensuring there's never a dull or spammy moment during combat (if you're Dante or Nero, at least). Dante has 4 weapons for both ranged and melee, each of which have incredibly fun designs (you can beat people to death by swinging around a motorcycle or throwing a hat around like Michael Jackson), and adds to that with 4 combat styles he can switch between that add extra actions to his arsenal. You can swap weapons and styles mid-combo, allowing for some downright astounding combos. Nero sticks to a single sword and gun, which sport a solid moveset by themselves, but the real meat of his variation comes from the 8 cybernetic arms that make up his 3rd attack button. From lightning punches, performing grabs ala DMC4, or firing out a flying rocket arm, he gets a ton of variety from these, and can eventually equip all 8 at once (or multiples of the same, as they can be broken by using supers or getting hit mid-attack). In an odd design decision, you can't switch arms mid-level, instead needing to destroy your current one to equip the next one, but at the very least this encourages you to make use of their super moves.

Sadly, V doesn't hold up nearly as well as our other heroes. Though he gets a solid deal of move variation through his three demon pets (a bird for ranged attacks, a shapeshifting panther for melee, and a giant laser-spewing golem for super moves), it still amounts to significantly less than the other characters. On top of this, the panther and golem both suffer from downright clunky AI. It's not uncommon to lock onto an enemy and summon your panther, only for him to appear 20ft in front of your target and just swing wildly at the air, wasting your time and killing your combo rating. The golem (and the other demons, if you spend meter to put them on autopilot) likewise has a tendency to wait a long time between attacks, wasting chunks of your super meter on nothing. He's even worse should you decide to take manual control, handling like a drunken sloth. V's moveset has a really cool design with a lot of potential behind it, so it's a shame it ended up such a clunky mess.

Balance & Enemy Design

DMC5 is in an awkward place with its balance. On the one hand, getting an S-rank for any given mission is genuinely challenging, and it's a ton of fun to push yourself to achieve that. Regular enemies have plenty of variety, and on NG+ are used in some really neat combinations. Bosses are solid final challenges to their levels, and their movesets even get expanded if you play on NG+ to really push you to your limit. It's awkward because DMC5 uses an unconventional setup of the first playthrough being "training" for the "real" experience in NG+. This works pretty good as long as you're the type who digs multiple runs, as the enemy placement on NG+ is so drastically different that you're practically playing different levels with the same story, but one-and-done types may find the regular fights lacklustre as a result, as there's multiple enemy types that only appear 2-3 times on the first playthrough, and even some of the weaker types end up underused.

Also there's the gold orb system; extra lives that revive you on the spot with no progress lost. You get a veritable pile of them throughout the game (I'd earned 25 or so by the end), and can also use regular upgrade currency, and as a result you can power through any difficult encounter by just reviving. While this won't impact people going for S-ranks, as using a revive tanks 25% of your score, people just concerned with beating every level may find their challenge being hampered quite a bit when they realize their death is nigh-meaningless.

As mentioned, the enemies have some incredible variety. You'll be up against a great deal of creative mechanics, such as a huge alligator-thing who can be freed from a muzzle to allow it to deal friendly fire to other enemies in exchange for increasing its range and attack power, cleaver-wielding berserkers who temporarily gain stun immunity and new attacks after being knocked down, or firebats who try to self-destruct if their HP gets low. Even the fodder enemy types have at least 3-4 attacks, so even minor combat encounters stay interesting.

Most bosses have a huge variety of attacks, and are each incredibly fun fights in their own right, though at least a couple suffer from having an attack that moves them really far away from you, messing with the flow of combat a bit. Also, a couple bosses are just introductory fights for regular enemies, and one mission is just fighting a big walker who only has two attacks and way too much HP. Mind you most of the bosses are still really fun, but 20% of your bosses being doody is a noteworthy percentage.

The Story

It's campy, cheesy, and wonderfully over-the-top. The characters may be vaguely American, but the tale they're involved in is as anime as it gets, and it's fantastic. It mixes the serious plot bits and the sassy snark together in a way that isn't awkward, something plenty of games try and fail at doing. If you've never played a DMC game before, there's an optional recap cutscene, and given that this was my first real DMC I'd say people unfamiliar with the series will still enjoy it a great deal.

The Graphics and Sound

The RE Engine remains a juggernaut of good looks. The human characters look great, and the enemies are straight-up menacing. The city supplements its standard bombed-out look with massive demonic tree roots and the creepy husks of blood-drained victims, and the levels inside of the giant underworldly tree are sometimes downright beautiful in a weird, hellish sort of way.

I found some of the brosteppy or screamo-y regular battle tracks in this very grating, but it ended up winning me over with the solid mix of rock and electronic in the boss tracks. The script has some lines that read a bit awkwardly, but the voice cast are all so solid that they more than make up for it.

In Closing

If you're a DMC fan, I've no doubt you'll love this entry, especially after the reboot. If you're a character action fan in general, then while this has some clunky spots, it's still a very welcome addition to the genre, and anyone who wants a solid challenge should enjoy it a great deal.

8.7/10

A mood of temptation takes over my mind
Condemned
Fallen weak on my knees, summon the strength
Of mayhem
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed, my family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ashes are divine
Descent in misery
Destiny chasing time
Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate
Can't run away
Keep walking the line, between thе light
Led astray
Through vacant halls I won't surrender
Thе truth revealed in nights of ember
We fight through fire and ice forever
Two souls once lost and now they remember
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed, my family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ashes are divine
Descent in misery
Destiny chasing time
Disappear into the night
Lost shadows left behind
Obsessions pulling me
Feeling I've got to take what's mine
Beneath the shadows under veil of night
Constellations of blood pirouette, dancing through the grace of those who stand at my feet
Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat
A derelict dark song from the ashes, the puppetmaster congregates all the masses
Pulling strings, twisting minds as blades hit
You want this power, then come try and take it
We are
The tree
Fire burns
Secret life
Bloodline yearns
Dark minds
Embrace
[?]
Bury the light deep within
Cast aside, there's no coming home
We're burning chaos in the wind
Drifting in the ocean all alone

For me i haven't played any Devil may cry game, but i won this one in giveaway so why not giving it a try.
so this review is from a new Dmc player perspective.


First thing i did i watched a lore explanation to understand what's happened and what to expect to see in this game but it wasn't enough.i understood most of the story even though i wished that i played all the previous games before i start the new one just to be familiar with the characters and understand the story properly.

STORY:
As i said the story is relative to the previous games so don't be like me and start with Dmc 5, am mad at my self for doing that.
Well you play with three characters that need to deal with demon named Urizen, there is a lot of shocking plot twists.

GAMEPLAY:
I'm not that familiar with this type of games so i cant really rate it but it was epic the combos, skills every thing is perfect with very good level design and unique enemies and bosses.
Every playable character has its own style (weapons,skills,abilities...) am sure you'll have fun with playing with every one of them.

GRAPHICS:
Damn, it's really epic and charming, the facial design is realistic and the animations is very good i cant describe how great it is but it's really beautiful (there is an in game photo mode).

SOUND TRACKS:
Just listen to this one

Views: 62,725,905
Devil Trigger - Nero's Battle Theme from Devil May Cry 5 by Casey Edwards feat. Ali Edwards and Cliff Lloret
:)

IN CONCLUSION:
If you are a fan to this game you'll love this one it's epic, if you are a new player don't be like me and start with this one you'll ruin its greatness, IT WORTH

I won’t lie, Devil May Cry 5 had me hesitant. From the moment they announced micro-transactions for currency in a single player game I was highly sceptical of what scummy business-model Capcom may try and leverage into the game. Was it going to be insanely grindy? Could they make the best weapons hidden behind pay-walls and therefore enforce a ‘fun tax’?

To be blunt, I didn’t trust it.

Then the game came out and it had fantastic reception. This turned my head and got me curious. I looked into it and it appears for the most part my concerns are unfounded.

The game did let you buy its main currency, and it looked like a few weapons were locked behind a pay-walls, but for the most part these looked like fun little gimmicks (a Megaman blaster arm for example) rather than any kind of major content. and there was only really one minor skill for each character that I would say was overpriced in an attempt to sell red orb DLC.

I was interested, but I still couldn’t quite bring myself to buy the game.

Then I had the chance to meet two of the games lead creators, Hideaki Itsuno and Matt Walker at Sydney Madfest 2019. They were fantastic, cool and fun guys and they managed to get me hype enough that when I got home I straight away bought Devil May Cry 5.

The game has been an absolute blast. Personally, it is my favourite entry in the entire franchise. Each of the three character play in there own way that is super fluid, unique and fun. It took me a couple of hours to wrap my head around the new character V (thought a lot of this is because my console controller is held together with nothing but tape and the hopes and dreams of my perpetually empty wallet). But once I did I was getting those SSS ranks no problem.

Nero’s play style feels like an evolution of his character in Devil May Cry 4, particularly after the first playthrough, when you have access to all his different powers and skills.

Finally, Dante plays like Dante, because why mess with perfection? He gets a whole bunch of cool new weapons and some old favourites re-imagined (I don’t want to spoil too much, but lets just say Kalina Ann has a sister, and you get to play with them both).

If you want a more in depth look at the play style I suggest looking at direct gameplay footage. If I try to explain though words it will just sound clumsy and dumb.

Now I want to take a look at the plot for a brief moment.

It works fine. I know some people really get into the stories of these games, and to that I say more power to you. Personally, I’ve always found they are little bit too predictable and bland, so besides that little teenage edge-lord voice that giggles with glee at every biblical or Divine Comedy reference, all I can really say is that it does its job and it does it well enough. Characters, setting and motivations are all established and presented in (with the exception of a few RE Engine uncanny-valley demon faces) beautifully rendered cut scenes.

If I did have one criticism of the narrative, it would be that this is a story of Dante, Nero and V. I love each of these boys. Then there is Nico, who serves as an engineer, building new gear for Nero (I know she has a few haters out there but I like her well enough) which gives her a direct impact in the plot. However, then Trish and Lady are there… Because? I don’t want to hate on Trish and Lady, they are both great. But I feel like they are there to placate the fanbase. Mainly to assure them that this isn’t another Ninja Theory spin-off title, rather than for any actual narrative or gameplay contribution.

All I’m saying is I want the girls out there doing what they do best: wreaking house and killing demons. Make that DLC campaign happen Capcom!

Devil May Cry 5 is the greatest scratch to my inner edge-lord itch since the first Matrix movie. I can highly recommend it to anyone who is into character action games.

Finally I just wanted to say this game claims to have multiplayer. Just a warning, it doesn’t in any meaningful sense. Google it if you want to understand the specifics. You won’t so much ‘play with your friends’ as ‘exist vaguely in the same space as randoms’.

9.8/10. Literally one of the best games I've ever played. Phenomenal story & incredible graphics/gameplay.

Combat:- DMC is known for being a hack and slash and that's exactly what they've done. The combat in this game once again is brilliant. It runs smoothly, each new unlock is soothing and enjoyable to use & the variety of multiple combo's/attacks/death animations that you can witness throughout playing this will leave you entertained for hours. Definitely a great deal of attention was put into creating this game and it really does pay off.

Graphics:- The graphics and detail put into every single mission, facial structure & enemy is beyond amazing. I expected a great amount of detail already but each new enemy/scenic setting/character & boss just left me amazed at the beautiful amount of time they've spent on each and every single thing.

Bosses:- Quite easy on the standard difficulties but I can imagine them being rather brutal the harder the difficulty gets. Really enjoyable and extremely fun to kill each boss/mini-boss in this game. Especially the main opposition that you're trying to kill.

Humour:- I was worried when I witnessed some humour at the start of the game and didn't want this to become a "meme" story whatsoever but by the end of the game I easily noted to myself that every single ounce of humour/joke amongst the game was PERFECTLY placed and fit in place just right. Especially towards the ending of the game & that dance scene? oh boy...that was hilarious. (You'll know when you get to it)

Story/Lore:- Absolutely superb. I was confused at times & definitely worried that I was going to have a quick fight with a boss and that would be the end of the game when I felt I was near the end but I have never been so wrong in my life. The "ending" was at least 4-5 missions and lasted just under two hours of gameplay I'd say. It's not just one boss fight, it's multiple fights, story linking together, lore and pieces combining and making sense. You learn SO much and you truly appreciate everything this game became. Not to mention everything else above...wow.

I've not been this blown away in a very long time with a game. a MUST buy. Especially if you get a discount. ~12 hours of gameplay to complete which is the reason this isn't a 10/10. Otherwise, truly breathtaking.

I thought my favourite DMC titles were the third and four ones, until I played this game, which has become my favourite one. The graphics, soundtrack and the very in-depth combat are just amazing guys, never expected so much. I've had lots of fun playing this game, everything on it it's excellent, one of the best games I've played this recent years.

The darkest of night falls around my soul
And the hunter within loses control
Gotta let it out
Gotta let it out
Gotta let it out
Gotta let it out

This demon inside has a hold of me
Clenching its power trying to break free
Gotta let it out
Gotta let it out
Gotta let it out
Gotta let it out

Move fast baby, don't be slow
Step aside, reload, time to go
I can't seem to control
All this rage that's inside me

Hold it fast, they've been dancing on this
Branded by fire on the abyss
Red hot temper, I just can't resist
All this vengeance inside me

All of these thoughts running through my head
I'm on fire, face burning red
Frustration is getting bigger
Bang bang bang
Pull my Devil Trigger

Embrace the darkness that's within me
No hiding in the shadows anymore
When this wickedness consumes me
Nothing can save you
And there's no way out

I'm a wildfire you won't tame
Not even my temper can put out the flame
There's no way to contain
This storm swelling inside me

I'm a bomb you can't defuse
I would just accept you're going to lose
Can't turn down, I refuse
To hold back anymore

All of these voices inside of my head
Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
Frustration is getting bigger
Bang bang bang
Pull my Devil Trigger

When on I dance, it's not over
Weave right through to get closer
Like a silver bullet piercing through
I throw myself into you

All of these voices inside of my head
Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
Frustration is getting bigger
Bang bang bang
Pull my Devil Trigger

Well, the Resident Evil 2 remake was really good and I played it a lot. So when starting this game I had pretty high expectations. Let's say I wasn't disappointed.

Apart from the occasional samey level design (looking at you missions 14 to 16) and some pretty 'spongy' enemies at higher difficulties, this game is really well made. The graphics, music and art style are all spot on. The ending is a bit too cliff-hanger for my taste, but that doesn't make the game any less fun to play.

The three characters all feature unique abilities and techniques that require some solid investment to flesh out fully, but you really want to look at the missions again to find more fragments, secret missions and hidden spots plus challenging yourself to face the enemies at a higher difficulty that it doesn't become tedious. The game play is almost always on point and figuring out how to get a higher combat rating while trying your acquired combos and skills is a lot of fun.

A very solid action game that adds a lot of replay value and an interesting set of playable characters. I'd recommend getting the game if you like fast paced action games that are challenging, but not frustrating.

+Pros:

+The game was more difficult than I expected. Higher difficulties add more moves to bosses and enemies and make them smarter and more aggressive and not just give them higher numbers.

+The Soundtrack is spot on! Every character has their own battle theme and they all fit perfectly, Especially Nero's battle theme (Devil Trigger). Every boss fight has a theme too continuing the series style

+Levels are not a bit more open and have diverging paths/secret paths which adds to the games replayability.

+Enemy designs are great and rivals the best in the series, 3. Maybe even surpasses it but only time will tell. It has some enemies from past games with new moves and a bunch of new enemies. All of which are fun to fight against and none are annoying, except for Fury.

+Boss fights are nice. They range from good to great.

+The Gameplay is this game's strong point. Maybe not as deep as 4 though. Dante's new weapons are a blast to play around with, and Nero's new devil breakers are extremely unique feeling and will make you want to play him even more.

+Some missions are playable with multiple characters which, Most of the time go in different routes so you will get to explore new places once you replay the game with the other characters you didn't pick at the time.

+Secret Missions are near perfect, They are the right amount of secret, and most of them are the right amount of difficult. you won't get all of them in the first playthough so you'll want to go back and play it again so you can find them.

+Blue orb & Purple orb fragments are well hidden in the level but are still possible to find.

+A notable feature in the settings is the adjustable camera length. This is an amazing feature that I wish more games would do.

+Another notable feature is the timeline between the mission loading screens, It has the date and time of day in which the mission you are about to go into is happening and where it fits in the overall timeline of the game.


-Cons:

-A lot of the settings don't really affect the game, just the cut-scenes. People want to turn off certain things so they can get a better frame rate while playing not in a cut-scene.

-Game lacks hard mode from the beginning. You need to play Normal difficulty first to unlock it. Also Legendary Dark Knight difficulty is not present in the game. It was very enjoyable in 4.

- Lady's voice acting is bad. Not really bad, just bad. Definitely the worst in the game.

- Trish's face model looks so ugly. It's just so bad. I don't know how it got through the final game.

- Since CAPCOM did the voice acting and the motion capture separate. Lip sync issues occur a lot in the game.

-Occasional cringe worthy lines.

-Environments lack diversity and can really mush together which is weird since this is something 4 got so well.

-Like every other DMC there is a boss rush mission. Although it is better in some aspects it's worse in others. It limits your abilities per boss fight and is utterly a bad design choice that, depending on your choice of boss in the beggining can somewhat break the gameplay.

-The game lacks turbo mode which made everything run faster in-game. I always played the games this way and playing 5 without it feels like a slog. I downloaded a mod to fix this.

-V is a bore to play with. Since V isn't the one fighting, the game tries to teleport them near enemies or near you when it thinks you need it. And most of the time it works and when it does you don't even notice it but sometimes it doesn't and you notice it hard. They would just teleport to you while you were doing a certain combo and now everything is ruined. He is also very slow and lacks the combo possibilities of the other.


-We should have been allowed to pick any character in any mission after beating the game to fight the different bosses with different characters.

-No Skins. We could have gotten skins from DMC 1-2-3-4 and coatless variations. Maybe even more Skins that didn't make the cut. Ultimately CAPCOM chose the lazy approach and just changed colours and called them skins.

-Micro-transactions. The game has buyable reb orbs, and although I'm 1000% against it, It really doesn't affect the game so I won't say they do, but would rather them not be in the game. What are bad micro-transactions though are the 4 extra devil breakers for Nero and the alt variation of the bike for Dante that has a stinger move in the air. To have moves locked behind a paywall in an action game like DMC is comparable to pay to win.

- Nero's new devil breakers aren't unlocked clearly. Only 2 of them have the same moves as their respective bosses and are unlocked after them. Other than that the rest are just unlocked after a boss and have no correlation with that specific boss. Would have been better if they were like the weapons.

-Low amount of humanoid bosses where can you have a 1v1. Also most bosses lack personality.

-Game lacks puzzles and overall metroid-vania design of 1 and 3, Which just makes you breeze through the environment and not really interact with it most of the time.

- No ability, after beating the game, to pick devil breakers for nero and no ability to switch between them without breaking them.

TL;DR:


To say Devil May Cry 5 wasn't a disappointment for me would be a lie. A lot of things that are known in the series are missing in 5, And the game lacks innovation, I thought they could make a lot more things with the formula that would have taken the game to another level. But in the end I'm just glad DMC is back with a solid entry and I hope it's not the last one since I can still see a lot of potential in the series.

I must say that DMC5 is one of my favorite game along with DMC3,This game is also good for those who are new the franchise since you get the easiest difficulty to play and learn the all mechanics.

Pros:
-Amazing Graphics(RE Engine at their best!)
-Amazing bosses and enemies with their movesets to learn.
-Returning and new characters.
-Bloody Palace mode which is challenging but its good.
And of course the music. Ali and Casey Edwards made the coolest music in this game.

Cons: Didnt find any :)

In conclusion i will say that if you want to try DMC franchise,start with DMC5 and then play the others.

I'd give to this game 10/10

One of the freshest and most fun action game I've ever played, but Capcom views PC customers as second-rate.

I'm not whining that the PC version isn't some superior version and need to have dominion over consoles. Forget that. I just think that EVERYONE should be able to play the game with as many bells and whistles and content regardless of platform and Capcom doesn't.

If the ray-tracing features and other additions coming to the Special Edition on PS5/XboxSX were an update (even part of the paid DLC for Vergin thus being a money-maker for Capcom) I wouldn't have any qualms. Flat out saying that you're not even considering adding those features for people who paid up and want to support this revitalized franchise is callous and insulting.

I will update this review if/when Capcom reverses their plans or lack thereof.

Devil May Cry 5

The only hack and slash game series that I really hook up playing it hours and buying myself a controller just to enjoy the game to the fullest. I only recently started to know this series on 2020. The game is fun and very challenging as well to beat some demons and others as well. The OST of the game is absolute banger as my favorite is probably Nero's theme, Devil Trigger and 2nd is Vergil's theme, Bury the Light. For the lore of the game, it's not difficult to understand but only required you to know some basic storyline from Devil May Cry 1 to 4 before playing this game. The visual and graphics for this game is beautiful as the game using RE engine from Capcom. As for new players, they don't need to buy vergil's DLC separately since this new package of the game already included it.

From my point of view, just let out all all your edginess and be motivated to play the game. The game is definition of cool or POWER as Vergil always said. Despite all the years of waiting for new Devil May Cry game since 2008, it's worth the wait and all old and new fans enjoyed it. 10/10 and I wish to play more but due to my weak POWER PC. Jackpot.

Genuinely the pinnacle of action game combat. Three of the four playable characters have more depth, flexibility and freedom of expression in their movesets and abilities than every weapon and spell in the entire FromSoft library combined, and the last one is still fun because he reads William Blake poetry while his pet bird, panther and giant shadow monster destroy everything in the background.

If there's any combat system better than this, then I haven't found it yet. I probably never will. More games should let you kill demons in slow-mo by throwing a cowboy hat at them and striking a pose.

Devil May Cry 5 is easily the most accessible game in the series for new players, while still offering all the series staples that existing fans love. I highly recommend picking it up when you can as the combat is stylish, environments and character models look great, the playable roster has been expanded and the soundtrack is amazing.

Story
In a first for the series DMC5 actually offers a quick history of series, listing each game in chronological order that can be viewed from the main menu. While it’s might not interest existing fans, it really helps new players understand who everyone is and saves you from having to flounder around trying to figure out why should care about any of the characters. I thought the story was impressive and well-paced with each chapter slowly revealing new information while following each of the 3 main characters journeys, with it being a race against time before events spiral out of hand. There seems to be a lot more humour in DMC5, especially between the main cast and Nico (the mechanic/ arms dealer). Dante’s flamboyant (arsehole) attitude seems to have been toned right down compared to DMC3 (I no longer want to throw a controller through the screen every time he speaks), and Nero (from DMC4) returns as still being hot-headed but learning to control his rashness. V acts a mysterious foil against both of the others, with a calm and matter of fact attitude, though his demon summon griffon makes up for it with attitude. While the story sort of ends with battles that you expect from the series, the path to them does take a few unexpected twists, and is quite enjoyable.

Gameplay
Gameplay is the same as previous games, you fight in enclosed combat spaces and use different combinations of moves to increase the rank gauge and try not to get hit (which resets the score). Higher combat scores provide better rewards, which allow you to purchase more moves and upgrade existing ones. The games overall difficulty is easier than past entries until you start unlocking the other modes which increase the difficulty to stupid levels (hell and hell being the choice for masochists). It also offers an option of auto enabling moves (like auto charging weapons), switching fight modes(Dante) and helping to chain attacks which makes combat much easier, but reduces your rewards.

Combat is vastly different depending on which character you are playing. Dante relies on different combat styles to change damage and moves set, while also wielding some outrageous weapons (if you ever wanted to wield a motorcycle as a sword this game has you covered). Nero has sword techniques, but his gimmick has him making use of disposable combat arms that each provide different effects and can be charged up for a one use super move (every wanted to see what mega man’s buster arm would look like on a person- you now can). V doesn’t attack at all, relying on his 3 summoned demons to attack (with him doing the final attack to kill them). The demons can be damaged (and can’t attack when damaged too much until they recover). I found V easiest to play with, but with auto assist it just becomes a button mashing exercise as long as you remember to move around so V doesn’t get hit.

There seems to be a lot less emphasis on puzzles, with there being more focus on combat, exploration of the environment, and boss fights. Exploring does prove to be worthwhile, as there are plenty of upgrade orbs hidden around stages, as well as other items to use, and secret missions to complete for rewards. There is a fair amount to do post game, from playing on each of the 6 different difficulties (they each unlock other modes, available upgrades or costumes), taking pictures of enemies dying (yes this is a thing), and completing the bloody palace, a 101 floor timed battle against different waves of enemies and bosses that can be completed with each of the characters. There is also a minimal online mode, where you are in the same stage as others (your progress doesn’t affect them in any way), where you can rate each other’s performance and award golden orbs.

Graphics
DMC5 has to be the best looking game in the series. While there aren’t many different locales (ruined city, inside a hell plant and hell itself) all look really good and is highly detailed (you see blood pumping through plants, walls look slimy). The environments don’t seem as dark as in DMC3 and collectables aren’t hidden in areas you can barely see. There is plenty of destructible object in the environment, however the environment itself seems immune to damage apart from superficial textures changes. Each characters are animated really well, and equipped weapons and items are always showed on characters when used in cut scenes. There is even an option to replace all the animated cut scenes with real actors in the menu (you can see these later in the gallery, but they are worth watching). I didn’t experience any crashes or screen tearing, and there was very little clipping. Sone of the mob enemies return from previous games, however none of them are recycled in DMC5 (you don’t encounter different variants that are just a colour swap). I thought all of the bosses were very good, and while they all test your ability to figure out attack patterns I thought the fight through the city was a standout (even if the fight itself is easy).

Music
The DMC series is known for its good music (and the heavy metal that plays when Dante is fighting), and DMC 5 doesn’t disappoint. Each character has different battle tracks when they fight (some are quite subtle compared to Dante’s standard battle music with a lot less screaming), but all increase in energy as your fighting rank increases (it’s not an increase in tempo, but choruses get added, and the songs change). It’s a very cool way to reward the player when they are performing well in combat (rather than just throwing extra experience at the player). All of the voice acting is excellent, and the effort has gone into making the character animation match the vocals. The script is very well written, I didn’t notice any overly cringey speeches, and the banter between the characters is a lot funnier (Dante seems to have mellowed in his old age).

DLC
There is an absolute ton of DLC options, with majority of it falling under boosting or cosmetic options. These can be handy if you aren’t going to play more than once, and want to use the best moves or different outfits, but majority of the moves will be unlocked after one playthrough. Some of the other DLC options are much more interesting, with Vergil being a playable character as well as the battle tracks from previous games being available to use in fights. Vergil has a different move sets, combos, however doesn’t add anything to the story (this is pure fan service).

Achievements
If you are chasing 100% achievements, then getting S ranks on Hell on Hell mode will likely see most people give up. Congratulation if you pull it off, as it requires complete mastery and knowledge of move sets, enemies and boss fights and requires perfect dodging. You also need to purchase the Virgil DLC.

This is, no question, the best game in the Devil May Cry series. You got everything you want here.
- 3 Playable Characters with their own unique playstyle, 4 if you got Vergil
- Amazing Soundtrack
- Probably the best story in the series since DMC3
- A badass style announcer, making hitting those SSS's more satisfying than before
- Air Taunts
- A Combat System that is as deep as an ocean with a crazy amount of replay value attached to it

This game is just overall so much fun to play, even more amazing once you get some mods in which give you cool stuff like a trainer that enables Co-Op. I bought this on PS4 before but I decided to pick up the PC version ever since I upgraded my PC and I am more than happy with my purchase as I am playing what has to be one of my favorite games of all time all over again, and it is quite an amazing conclusion to a franchise that has given me countless hours of pure joy.

Simply put, Devil May Cry 5 was everything I wanted out of a current gen game, thank you Capcom and Hideaki Itsuno for making this masterpiece.

TL;DR: A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BLAST to play. 10/10 for me. I'd totally recommend it to anyone.

A nice thing about this game (at least in my opinion) is you can decide if this game is for you by watching the Intro credit cinematic, if you don’t like that cinematic, you won’t understand what DMC is and this game and franchise is not for you. But anyway, moving on, in terms of story itself, I really liked it. Even though it’s definitely not the best stories or anything. It’s a mediocre story with predictable events for the most part. If you wanna buy this game for just it’s story and if you aren’t a DMC fan, then you probably won’t like it. But a nice thing that this game does have is a “History of DMC” option for new players to understand a bit about the universe so you’re not really going into DMC 5’s story blind. Either way, the story is 4/5 I’d say. (I’m a bit biased on the story, so if I’m being honest, it would be a 3/5 or something, an average story)

BUT the gameplay…. The gameplay literally carries this game’s review to 10/10 in my opinion. I’ll go one by one on character gameplay review. But I’ll say this before I go there, the soundtracks for each character, especially Nero’s...is soooo good. Casey Edwards has done SO MUCH for this game by just his music.

V:
Okay, this character’s gameplay…. might get boring depending on your taste. He’s kind of a zoner in a hack and slash game, which actually is a unique idea for a hack and slash. And I’m glad they experimented with this. V is by no means bad though, but once you start enjoying the game for what it really is, you’ll understand what I’m talking about.
But Nero and Dante…. boy oh boy!

Nero:
I was already a fan of Nero from 4 even though fans didn’t really like Nero much apparently. But in this game, the feature of “Devil Breakers” (a major part of Nero’s kit in gameplay) is the best thing the devs decided to do for this game. And this in my opinion raises Nero’s combo potentials SO high….my god. I LOVE playing Nero as much as Dante. I’m by no means a master of this series or combat, but his gameplay is so satisfying. He certainly has earned his spot in this franchise with this game.

Dante:
What’s not to like about Dante? He’s badass as usual. And the addition of a few weapons in this game makes him even more fun. Like I previously said, I’m no master in this game and I’m trying to learn everything while I play. I’ve only kinda mastered the “Swordsman” style so far. But combining all his styles in gameplay is what makes him really really fun to play.

Vergil:
OMG, WHY ARE YOU SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY? You thought Nero and Dante was fun? Try Vergil and you won't touch those two for a while. He makes you feel so overpowered and makes you get into his edgy character while you play as him too. Even while making you feel op, he's so balanced. Capcom, sincerely hats off to you on this game. His gameplay combined with his track "Bury the Light", holy moly.......You can't just stop killing.

Enough about gameplay though. Even if you finish this game, it’ll still leave you wanting for more. I legit wanna try doing a 100% achievement or close to that for this game. The replay potential for this game is so nice. The bloody palace is a great way for you to keep playing the game. And if you wanna challenge yourself in story, there’s higher difficulties there as well. Although I’ve heard it gets boring in higher difficulties in story due to how much health the mobs and the bosses have. So, just settle with the “Son of Sparda” difficulty, which is the perfect difficulty according to a lot of players (including me). The voice acting is amazing and a HUGE part of this game. The cinematics, the world, I was immersed as hell while playing this game. Holy hell this was a blast to play. So, I’ll end my review here by saying this game is DEFINITELY worth it if you wanna pick it up on sale (full price is a bit too much to ask in my opinion tbh) and if you’re interested in hack and slash even by a little. Even if you’re not, who knows? Maybe you’ll end up loving it regardless.

Devil May Cry 5... Oh boi, where do I start?!
I highly recommend you at least play the 3rd and 4th installment of the series before this one, but you do not need to. However, the story will leave a bigger impact on you if you do.

Gameplay is just as awesome as earlier installments, if not a bit better. I still can't get used to the combat style of V though.

Story is amazing, a lot of pulls from the stories of earlier games come forth and it all brings up a heavy climax in the end, it is absolutely worth it to avoid all spoilers, so try to avoid looking up anything, because google search results in themselves have spoilers in the titles.

I don't know, I can't say much more without spoiling the game for you if you haven't played it.

Story: 10/10
Gameplay: 9/10
Visuals: ?/10 - I got a dated PC so I run on low graphics.
Overall: 10/10 - Possible Game Of The Year contender. (GOTY!)

This game is cool. This game is about being cool. You will probably not enjoy it unless you have time to devote to actually getting good at it. Because you have to make the cool moments yourself. It's a like a sandbox, the game gives you a bunch of enemies to beat up, and a bunch of different moves for beating them all up with. The rest is up to you. If you're not good, you'll flail around like an ineffectual fish until the enemies die of second-hand embarrassment. But if you ARE good, you'll string together a series of moves that flow from one another, using every tool at your disposal, throwing in taunts, dodges and parries for good measure as your style rank sits at a permanent SSS until you've mown down everything in your path.

Oh my god

I've never had this much fun in a videogame in like, years.

The adrenaline really gets you going with it's awesome soundtrack, pulling off a perfect royal guard as Dante and then hearing SS Rank kick in, it really feels out of this world.

The story is amazing, their is a lot of throwbacks to DMC3 and it welcomes new and old players to the fifth installment in a really good way, the characters are super memorable and really shine throughout the game.

The gameplay is nicely fleshed out as the entire campaign is split up between 3 characters, you've got Dante for going over the top with weapons, Nero for more smooth gameplay with minimal switching, and V for strategy (controlling more than 1 character) it's all preference on who you like the most as some missions let you choose who you want to play.

Multiple playthroughs of the game are rewarding (Super players after DMD) and has quite a lot of replayability in gamemodes such as Bloody Palace and in higher difficulties like Heaven or Hell. (HOH pretty much turns it into a shooter when you one shot everything.)

Would I recommend this?
Well, I didn't play a lot of action games before this but Devil May Cry 5 100% changed my perspective on them, BUY it if you love action and fast paced gameplay.

I personally think it's GOTY 2019 for Action, that's how much I liked it.

Why didn't I play any of the older games before ? I always heard that Devil May Cry was kind of a joke in the gaming community with the games being too anime, over the top, difficult and apparently some of the ones before this, pretty bad. But this game...... this game........ it is amazing. It is still anime as hell, over the top, difficult (especially if you're new) but most definitely not bad. The combat, the cinematics, the action, movement everything screams fun. And I think that one word pretty much summarises this game. It is fun, it is fun as hell. Easy to pick up and play for all types of people. Great job capcom, I hope you revamp all of your franchises in the same way.

One of the best hack n slash 3rd person game ever made, well Nero & Dante are back of course and so is Vergil hahah the new character V is also great and i liked a lot to played as himself, i won't give spoilers but you'll find out later in the game... well playing as Nero was extremely boring... most time of the game only in the final was a bit nice but Dante & V are great to play with, of course we have those extremely g&$geus ladies such as Nico which has a crush on Nero, the lovely Lady Mary & Trish <3
Too bad we can't play as Vergil :( but besides this problem the game is alright, prolly the next game of this wonderful franchise they will certainly make him playable.

in the name of deadbeat father, dead weight son and wacky wohoo pizza man. amen


this game is AMAZING.

I am not a hardcore gamer compared to the others but i still enjoy it nonetheless.
Gameplay is easy to learn, satisfying combos, not to mention the actions.
Environment? Damn, i got that DMC4 nostalgia but much more better!
Cutscenes and Story are chef kisses. the compilation of the cutscenes make a really good movie out of itself.

this is it CAPCOM. DMC was one of my first PC game that i played, it makes me shed happy tears to know that the REAL sequel is this good. 10 years waiting was not in vain. GOOD JOB!

The best Devil May Cry game
For around 25$ you can get this game from 2019 that outshines most of the games made even now. Also it's a fully working game with a lot of polish without 20$ skins and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
The worst thing is lack of Special Edition for the PC owners.

Highly recommend it. Go and play it.

I really enjoyed this game - beat the story twice so far, once with the normal route and once with the Vergil DLC. Still very far away from learning all skillsets and unlocking items, though.

I enjoyed that iconic weapons from previous games came back, and movesets were similar.

The new character V is kind of a mixed bag for me. It's a bit more of a tactical/long range thing - he summons monsters that do damage, and V himself can barely attack. He is playable in least amount of levels, so I didn't mind per se, but if I had to pick characters willingly, he would still be the last I would pick, compared to Vergil, Dante, and Nero.

Story is non-existent, compared to even Devil May Cry 4. I know, I'm not playing DMC games for the story, but this world was pretty barren. At least DMC4 had side characters and a living world, this one is just the playable characters, the gunsmith Nico, and friends of DMC (Trish, Lady, Morrison appear for 2 minutes).

So there wasn't much lore wise to think about. Just focus on learning the combos, finding collectibles.

If you enjoy this review please consider following my Curator page here .


I’ve always enjoyed character action games or spectacle fighters, whatever you want to call them, with the Bayonetta games, Metal Gear Rising and yes, DmC. I know that DmC gets quite a bad rap within the Devil May Cry community, but I frankly loved it. Perhaps this was due to the fact that I have only dabbled in the mainline series with the first DMC on PS2 as well as DMC 4, both of which I bounced off of pretty hard. Well I’m happy to say that this was not the case with DMC V. It’s great.

First off, the game offers a great recap of the previous games for those like myself, who never played through the earlier games. It set the table well and I felt as if I more or less knew who everyone was and what their motivations were. Although the story here isn’t main attraction. While I found the story to filled with melodrama and be over the top while still remaining somewhat self-aware, people play these for the tight gameplay.

Perhaps more so than any other character action game I’ve played, DMC V feels almost like a traditional fighting game, with precise button prompts and a deep suite of combos. For those who are not as dexterous or want all the flash without necessarily having to remember combos, there is an ‘Auto’ setting where you can still perform all of the fancy, high level combos without as much fuss. I found this to be a great way to empower the player and give them flexibility with choice. Of the main characters, Dante was my favorite, no surprise there. What I was surprised at though is how much I enjoyed playing as V compared to Nero. V has essentially no physical attacks, instead using avatars to fight for him. I found this be compelling in that it was such a departure from what you normally see in these types of games and I found it to be a bold design choice that paid off.

Graphically, the game looks fantastic. I had it nearly maxed out at 1440p on a 1060 and it held a rock-steady 60fps at all times. Capcom’s new RE Engine seems to be optimised exceptionally well and I imagine will scale very nicely. I would say that my main gripe with the game is that I found the levels to be pretty uninspired. There’s a lack of distinctive and memorable areas, instead we get a lot of crumbled buildings and bloody, pulsating masses. Now I know given the context these themes suite the game, I just wish there would have been a bit more creativity on the level design front.

Overall, Devil May Cry V is an excellent action game for newcomers like myself and I’m confident veterans will enjoy it too. Whether you want to use ‘Auto Combo’ to pull of flawless flashy combos or you want to hone your skills mastering and memorizing movesets, there’s something here for everyone.

I don't usually play third-person action games with the exception of From Software whose works I have followed for a long time. After seeing how this game had beaten out fan favorites and big names for Action Game of the Year like Call of Duty, Gears of War, Apex, and Metro, I was curious as I had never played a DMC game. I got it on sale and endeavored to give it a try.
From the moment the opening sequence began, I was hooked. Even with only the basic knowledge of game lore provided, the story drew me in with its rapid-fire pacing and high-speed action, starting from the end of the very first cutscene. I quickly grew invested in characters with and of whom I had no previous experience or knowledge, though at times dialogue felt forced for the sake of unnecessary exposition, which was often provided redundantly through flashbacks.
The game's greatest strength, its combat, also serves to hinder it at times. In comparison to the purity and fluidity with which the most combat-intensive portions play, many of the other simpler sections of platforming or exploration can feel dull by comparison.
That's not to say that the combat holds the game back, on the contrary. The developers were definitely aware that the combat was the true keystone feature of the game, and they make excellent use of it. The combat never once feels stale or repetitive, and every character plays in a totally different manner. Unlike many other games, the combat can allow even the clumsiest, most button-mashing noobs such as myself to pull off awesome combo chains through the use of the auto-chain feature, something which I have not seen in other games. The combat itself is incredibly responsive and has better feedback than any game in recent memory for me. This is underscored by the game's sound design, providing real meaty THWACKS alongside the games excellent soundtrack. At the normal difficulties, the game is perhaps slightly too easy, to the point that an uninitiated such as myself can make it more than 3/4 of the way through the game without dying. Perhaps this is not the case on higher difficulties, but as this review was written during my first playthrough, I am not yet certain.
At no point during this game have I felt that it was at all undeserving of the hype which it has received. Perhaps someone with more investment into the series may feel otherwise, but as my first DMC game this has served both as an excellent introduction and to ignite my interest in the other games in the series. A firm recommendation to all who will listen, and an easy choice for one of my favorite games of 2019.

The Story:

-This game continues where the 4th game left off. Yes, you heard that right, it changes the timeline so that the 2nd game is not the last. The story ties up almost all of the loose ends made by the other games in a nice fashion and the ending is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ beautiful too. To me this is how story making in games should be done.
-This journey, like in the 4th game is mostly about Nero and kind of putting the focus on his arc, but what sets it apart is that it actually does it well this time and also does a great job finishing the sibling rivalry of Dante and Vergil.

The World/Level Design:
-I'm quite disappointed at what was in here. I feel like they had much more freedom with what they could do in the missions that it's just a lost opportunity. I loved the design of Mission 2 but that design fades away after like 3 missions and then from there it's just Casual bloody corridor number 21234.
-There are aspects of job well done in these levels but it's the overuse of them that kind of tires me out.

The Character Design (and use of Trish and Lady in the story):
-The character designs are truly phenomenal,very distinct and memorable. All the way from Nero & Dante to even the enemies.
-Not only is this a huge plus for newcomers to the franchise as they will remmember these legendary protagonists, but is also a huge help with the combat (which I will talk about further down).
-Now I didn't know where to put this so I guess I'll cram it in here. I'm truly disappointed at how they handled Trish and Lady. They both have like 5 lines in the whole game, one fight scene, and literally have no point in the story. If you ask me, I would be fine with them saying: oh they got captured and then you save them at the end, so they wouldn't even need to focus on them.
The Voices:
-From Johnny Yong Bosch, Daniel Southworth and all the way to the phenomenal japanese voice actor Toshiyuki Morikawa (who also does Kira Yoshikage in Jojo's Bizzare Adventure).
-All of the voice actors do a great job at making the characters feel fleshed out and alive. You can feel the love and passion they put in every scene and that just deserves respect. (Not to mention that Daniel is actually quite a decent guy outside of his job, the man is just amazing.)

The Soundtrack:
-Dmc has always had a killer soundtrack. (well, I guess it mostly depends on your taste)
-From the new soundtrack Devil Trigger, to the old Public Enemy and Out of my Way, they do an amazing job at the execution.
-Not only do they make new killer tracks, but they pay respects to all of the old ones which is a huge plus in my book.
-Each soundtrack is made to ramp up as you ramp up the combat, to make your adrenaline pump even harder and elevates the gameplay to even greater proportions.

The Gameplay:
-I would like to stress this out as much as I can, altough I probably can't stress it out enough. This franchise has the best combat system that has ever been made. From the many variations you can do,t o how the combos flow seamlessly one into another while the music is kicking in the background and you finish it off with that taunt at the perfect moment when the song stops. There is no better feeling then that.
-The Upgrade System is not anything new, as returning players are familiar with it from Dmc 4 most likely. The upgrades themselves aren't all on the new side, there are plenty of upgrades that are the same as in Dmc 4 and then added on top of them are the new ones.
Nero's Gameplay:
-Nero has gotten much more complex due to introduction of the Devil Arms. Powerful arms, which can change how you play and interact with enemies on multiple levels.
-From the Exceed mechanic that powers all of your attacks if timed correctly, to the devil arm combos and on top of all of that add the Devil Trigger mechanic and the use of just normal combos, and players can find themselves quite overwhelmed as to what move to choose for that Smoking Sick Style.
-Nero is my favorite out of the 3 currently playable characters. I simply love how he interacts with the environment and the enemies in many fun ways, from the Devil Trigger to even using your Taunt to kick enemies.
-I also want to touch on his character development throughout the game. They did an outstanding job with Nero in my opinion. He went from being this boy who gets mad and wants more POWER! to a man that just wants to protect and unite his family.
Dante's Gameplay:
-Now, if someone had the time to sit here all day reading my reviews, I would go into detail why Dante is the most complex video game character ever made, but I'm going to try and make it short and sweet.
-Dante is the hardest to play out of the 3, due to him having so many options in combat and being able to change your weapons and playstyle on the fly, changing how Dante works with the press of a single button is something else, but to be able to master this man is quite insane.
-In my opinion Dmc 5 Dante is much easier to play than his Dmc 4 counterpart, and thats a good thing for the casual players. (I will touch on this topic more below)
-Storywise, Dante is still the lovable, charming and silly guy that he is. Honestly, all the character development has been done and you would think they wouldn't put that much time into him, but you would be wrong, as they elevated his arc into something beautiful too. His arc is put to an "end" here in a satisfying way that I am content with, this being the final game in the franchise.

The new guy V:
-Plenty of people seem to love V for his, on the outside, edgy anime protagonist personality, but the soft and nerdy one on the inside look, and I must say they are all wrong.
-The reason V is a good character is how he contrasts the gameplay of Nero & Dante in a fun way, how he handles himself in situations unknown to him and how his new combat system works.
-All in all V was, and is a good addition to the roster and I will miss him if another game comes out.
Combat system in general:
-As I have mentioned above, when talking about Dante, the game been made "easier" so that the more casual players can get into it and not feel as overwhelmed. I, for one, am aboard. If you want a challange, just go to a higher difficulty and there, problem solved.
-What I am not a fan of, is that they removed the "Inertia" mechanic. I won't go into detail on this mechanic, as it alone makes the game 10x more complex. This mechanic alone is why I think that Dmc 4 has the better combat system for the super invested and advanced players such as Donguri99, Blue Devil, Milz and others. With "Inertia", so many things are made possible and I am truly sorry that I can't go further into detail, but take my word for it.

Conclusion:
-Devil May Cry 5 is an outstanding game. It might not live up to the combat complexity of Dmc 4, for the invested players but for the casual players and long running fans of the series, this is without a doubt, a very polished masterpiece that no one would mind playing over it's counterpart.
-From the story, to the music, the character and enemy design, and the amazing combat system, Hideaki Itsuno has made his very own gem in the gaming industry that will be remembered as one of gaming's best, and fans will remember him as the man who did the impossible.

It is an excellent game but I am afraid I will have to give it a negative review. Capcom gave Console players Special Edition but not to PC players saying that that it is optimized only for Console implying that PC won't be able to run it. What a joke. Capcom has treated PC players poorly and won't go back on their decision now.

It makes no sense as there was DMC3 and DMC4 Special Editions but 5 is getting skipped? It is not good enough and I recommend people not buy this until Capcom starts treating PC players better.

Amazing game, a good story with great visuals. Even if you are not familiar to the DMC series it does a good job of recaping the story with a short video so you dont feel left out. It also has tons of replayability, you unlock higher difficulties, newer abilities and a great boss unlock, although you do have to pay to play as him. It is definitely ment to be played multiple times.
9/10
Definitely Recommend it

This is my very first review here on Steam, and it's for a game I love. In fact, it's the only game I have on steam with 100% achievement completion.
So here's your negative review Capcom.
Imagine you buy a game on your chosen platform, and a year and a half later you finally get the DLC that everyone's been asking for and the game is complete.
But wait!! Turns out you bought the game for the wrong system, because Capcom decided that only next gen consoles are worthy of difficulty modes THAT THIS SERIES HAS BECOME KNOWN FOR! They've been in previous games!!
Way to be scum Capcom

This game by itself absolutely deserves a thumb up. Unfortunately, Capcom's decided to get greedy and not give us Special Edition on PC. We're getting Vergil DLC, but not a new difficulty, or Turbo mode, or performance upgrades, or increased FPS, or Ray Tracing, because only the PS5's "architecture" can handle it. Bullsh*t, a lot of PC's could have handled these features at launch, and new consoles will be underpowered again as soon as the new Nvidia cards are out. RE2 Remake and DMC 5 were a sign that Capcom was back to it's former quality. But between RE3 Remake and this Special Edition fiasco, it was apparently just a lucky streak. The players and community have done a lot for this game. They deserve some respect from Capcom, not an insult.

More than 10 years of waiting since the release of DMC4... You could say that this game was my "Half Life 3," so to speak. And while I preordered it and played it on day 1, I've been hesitant to write my review for quite a while. The reason is simple - I've been giving Capcom a chance to unveil this game's full potential through some DLC that the community has been asking for, but sadly, our pleas were left ignored. So we're most likely stuck waiting for Special Edition's release, that'll most likely happen along with the release of new consoles.
With that said, I do still hope that Capcom won't force this SE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on us for the fourth time in franchise history, and I will be happy to update my review should they release new content, but for now let's have a look at what DMC5 shaped up to be, and whether it managed to live up to it's hype.
Overview
True to its name, DMC5 delivers exactly what you expect from it - amazing, fast-paced, engaging and challenging gameplay, accompanied by fantastic soundtrack and some really good graphics. The characters are as badass as ever (don't mention DmC, we don't talk about it here), and the overall story is... well, okayish. The story never was a particularly strong point of this franchise, save for, perhaps, DMC3; and the fifth entry, sadly, doesn't blow your mind in any way, either.
Story
Diving a bit deeper into the story, I have to say that this is arguably the weakest aspect of the game. The story's pace, the way it starts, the way it just constantly jumps back and forth the different characters and moments of time, and the fact that this time around, we have three playable characters... It just feels rushed, both in terms of pace and production. The standard 20 missions just don't cut it anymore; they just can't give enough screen (and play) time for all characters. And I haven't even mentioned the ending. I do not wish to spoil anything, but let me just put it like this: the ending felt as if the devs were forced to wrap things up ASAP and just let the potential for much more character development and drama go to waste. It can even be felt in the last two missions design, since they are... Well, 
Gameplay
Luckily, gameplay in the fifth game is arguably the best it ever was. That's right, my friends, even in its current state I'm ready to say that DMC5 surpasses both DMC3 - the most beloved game in the series - and DMC4SE, with it's biggest roster of playable characters yet. DMC5 takes the best elements of DMC4 and even some of the reboot's good practices, presenting us with a really great and diverse experience. The three playable characters each feel significantly different and unique. Nero feels like a solid upgrade over his version in DMC4 (both in terms of gameplay and character, actually), now relying on his new prosthetic arms, which essentially serve as powerful consumables. Dante feels like the most badass devil hunter there is, with four battle styles to master, 4 melee and 4 ranged weapons to choose from, as well as some powerful new abilities that almost make him feel like Sparda's equal. He feels the most challenging to play as, motivating you to start learning all his mechanics and not just stick to one preferred playstyle. And finally, V, the newcomer. Surprisingly enough, I liked this character far more than I originally thought I will. Again, this goes for both him as the playable character and the character in the story. His playstyle feels, by far, the most unique. It still feels close to standard DMC gameplay, but the whole idea of him using his familiars, rather than fighting himself, adds a whole new layer. And don't let yourself get fooled by the power of his familiars - on lower difficulties, his gameplay does feel a bit like button mashing and keeping a safe distance, but if you wish to give yourself some challenge, I highly recommend you to try playing as him on higher difficulties; you'll learn that this character is by no means invincible. The only real disappointment is that he feels the most rushed, with the least amount of missions to try him out in action and most limited moveset.
Another aspect of gameplay worth mentioning is "coop," of course. For some reason, instead of giving us option of legit coop experience, Capcom gave us a stupid cameo system straight from Resident Evil. Translation - you may encounter other players, but in most cases you won't even be able to interact with them. And the only TWO(!) moments when you can actually play along with them last for about 5 minutes or so.
Graphics
Not much to say here - the graphics are fantastic. The new, more photorealistic style served this game surprisingly well, even though the previous chapters looked more like your standard, final fantasy-like, anime style games. The characters were redesigned a bit to fit this new style better and again, they actually ended up quite likeable. Weapon and enemies design is great, visual effects are amazing, and the only thing that is a bit disappointing is level design. The levels feel way too similar visually, with half of them taking place in a wrecked city, covered in demonic tree's roots, while the other half takes place in... well, the demonic tree mentioned above. Not much to look at, sadly.
Sound
Again, true to it's name, DMC5 delivers solid voice acting, solid sound design and phenomenal soundtrack. The only thing that I can highlight about sound is the new feature that changes the pace of track based on your current style level. It is both a great innovation and a bit of a letdown: while you actually enjoy the game reacting to you playing well, and you get motivated to keep your style level at max, the length of the song gets quite reduced, because you only get to hear a fraction of it that is designated to your particular style level. Another drawback of this system is that it only works for the new tracks, so if you bought the deluxe edition, don't expect the tracks from old games to behave the same way. And another personal complaint of mine - even with a bunch of tracks now available, there's no way to making your own tracklist for each character. You can only choose one battle theme for each.

Conclusion
DMC5 may yet become the best game in the series. It is a really great game in it's current state, but it's just a bit rushed. It feels that the team was eager to deliver more, but the deadlines limited their creativity. If I were given a choice of either getting this game the time it actually came out, or to wait another year for it, I would undoubtedly choose to wait. This game needs more missions, it needs proper coop, and it could definitely use more playable characters (or a certain playable character, at the very least). I genuinely hope that this game's full potential will be fully realised, one way or another. And once this time comes, I will be glad to edit this review accordingly. =)
Until then, 8/10, even though it should've been a 9. Why not 10, though, you ask? Because a 10/10 game in my opinion is something worth recommending to literally everyone, regardless of their preferences. And DMC has always been a bit of a niche franchise. This is the same reason why I can't call it a GOTY material (tbh, I don't think there was any game that truly deserved the GOTY 2019 title, and it is most certainly not Sekiro). But if you're looking for a great slasher game, or just want to give DMC franchise a try - you have my total approval, although if you care about the story, I would suggest you start with DMC3.

P.S. A well-deserved "Best action game of 2019" title. Let us keep our fingers on our Devil Triggers crossed and hope that Capcom will give this game some much needed content updates as soon as possible.

Rating: 8.5/10
Genre: Action Adventure

The Good:
+ Levels are well designed with great aesthetics. The levels are linear in nature, however there are a few times when you can go off the path and explore and discover a hidden secret. Although the levels are linear the developers did a good job of constantly changing the environments or throwing a new enemy at you to keep you on your toes.

+ 3 separate characters each with their own combat systems, weapons and style. In some levels you can choose who you want to play as but most of the time, each level is constructed around a particular character in mind.

+ The combat system is where this game really seems to shine. The system is designed with both newcomers and experts alike. For those like myself that just want to play casually to a degree will find enough here to enjoy and those looking for something more can master more complex systems and become amazing. The game includes an ‘auto assist’ mode for those who really want a casual experience where the game will automatically string together some very impressive looking combos. Although personally I found that mode takes away a lot of the fun.

+ Almost every level features a unique boss that looks great and fun to play against. Bosses make sure you use of the combat system more effectively and forces you to play a bit more defensively than you normally would.

+Bloody palace is an option that becomes unlocked after you beat the game where you have to battle 100 floors of enemies. Good for those looking for more of a hardcore challenge.

+ 6 difficulty modes and some of the higher modes completely change the enemy placement.

+ Good soundtrack

The Average:
+/- The game has lots of loading, go to menu screen…loading…watch cutscene…loading…begin level…loading. The good news is, the loading is fast so its not really too much of a problem.

+/- Story is decent and requires little knowledge of previous events although it certainly helps as things can get convoluted. DMC5 features a helpful video explaining the past events of the previous games.

Conclusion:
A very accessible game that’s fun to play and soak in all the over the top action drama while you hack and slash grotesque enemies to a rock soundtrack.

God. An absolute blast of a game. Each character is unique and had so much fun playing everyone. One aspect of the game that I never saw mentioned anywhere is when a branching path mission happens and more than one character is present, that character is controlled by another player. In an otherwise single player game, making the other character be controlled by someone else rather than just being an AI is honestly really cool and I hope that continues in DMC going forward and other games try out the same if the story has multiple protagonists.


This is also one the best looking games - PERIOD. Extremely flashy and just oozes personality and love from the developers. Capcom hit it out of the park with the RE engine.


Some aspects of criticism is nitpicky at best. V in my opinion was a really fun character and a great implementation of a summoner type character in a beat em up. Dante being unlocked very late into the game is a valid criticism but V and Nero were still cool and great characters.

I shot my arm, rode it, punched the ♥♥♥♥ out of someone with it and then an emo teen recited some Black Veil Brides lyrics. Then in my next playthrough I played as the coolest videogame character ever and then I cut through space and time to beat my cowboy hat wearing little brother. And all of that was fun, this is as videogamey as videogames can get, it never slows down, it does not give a ♥♥♥♥ if you want to slow down. It's a ride that keeps going higher and faster until you reach the peak where you face the hypest boss in videogame history. Yeah exploration is minimal but who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about walking around, I wanna slap some demon ass. Man this game is fun, now on to my third playthrough.

DMC 5 is the action game that all action games want to be.

It provides a deep and endless combat system without compromising in graphics and the presentation of its story. The gameplay is boundless and there is always something new to experiment with, master, and learn. There is so much to mess around with, and the game is happy for you to break it in ways that are only limited by your own creativity. No matter what level of player you are, the game makes you feel both powerful and stylish.

For DMC fans this is the conclusion to the stories and threads left unfinished by Capcom for the last 10 years between DMC 4 and DMC 5, and it is a satisfying one. Unfortunately, my main gripe with it is that the story is NOT newcomer-friendly story wise. DMC 5 is very self-indulgent with callbacks and references to DMC games, manga, anime and spinoffs. The impact of the story and many elements within it WILL be lost on a newcomer to a series. I recommend playing or watching the stories of all the games (except DMC2) before playing DMC5.

Oh yeah, Capcom also has some deceptive microtransactions that serve as early unlocks or additional ingame currency that DON'T add to the gameplay at all and aren't necessary, a bit of a rubbish move there.

All in all, DMC 5 is a ridiculously good game. After all this time, Capcom finally gives DMC the budget it deserves and we have this game that ticks every box for long time fans and new players interested in action games. I keep coming back to this game again and again and I just can't stop.It is THAT good.

A love letter to the series. If you're a fan of the Devil May Cry games and for some reason have not played this one, I cannot recommend it enough. The base game is good enough and there is plenty of mod support that can give your gameplay experience some variety. If you're new to the games, you can also start with this one if you'd like since there is an option to review the story within the game to catch you up. Devil May Cry 5 is a stylish game that allows you to test your creativity alongside a cast of memorable characters with satisfying combat and a great soundtrack.

They really dont like pc customers do they?

First they release this game normal and as a deluxe edition with a bunch of extra content. However if you bought the normal version you had no chance to get the deluxe content at all. This got finally fixed after MONTHS but now...

How are we PC customers only getting a Vergil DLC?
It is insane that we get less than consoles. No Legendary Dark Knight mode, no Turbo mode,

this is insane and honestly anti-consumer.



And on a sidenote, the other PC-products of Capcom have always been washy at best or awful ports at worst. Looking at you Monster Hunter..

DMC5 is the best DMC game up to date. Not in just terms of graphics but also in terms of just combat and mechanics.

Pros:
-Graphics are top notch and really immersive. Get to explore the DMC world again with Nero as the lead.
-Fun interactions and gameplay. Characters are interesting as well and we get to see some old characters back in actions.
-Combat is fluid and extremely versatile. Incredibly fun to experiment with.
-DLCs are a nice touch including adding in certain characters.

Cons:
-None so far

I got this because I wanted to perform cool combos but then it quickly made me realise how bad I am at remembering/executing them ;-;

Even though I have never played any previous DMC games combined with my lack of skills in this type of combo-focused games, I still really enjoyed it a lot especially the exaggerated edginess of all the characters and the over-the-top cutscenes. I enjoyed playing as Nero the most, as his arsenal was small with a limited amount of combos combined with different types of wacky Devil Breakers (Robotic Arms) and also a grappling hook, so, I was able to chain some combos pretty easily, It was a really thoughtful decision to have him as a starting character but as we progress the game introduces 2 more playable characters and out of those only V had a very different/innovative style of combat and I really don't wanna spoil it here. Meanwhile by the end Dante's arsenal, combat-styles and combos overwhelmed me and I think i don't even know half the things I can do with him. :(

Now I am Excited to play as the Storm that is approaching.....

Holy hell. This was the Devil May Cry game we've been waiting for a very long time! I enjoyed every minute of it and this might be one of my favourite games this year. It's only March as well! The story was also pretty good! Near the end it did feel like things were going fast but at least it didn't get dragged on or padded out. But it's a complete story from beginning to the end. I won't say much more about it due to spoiling and want people to find out for themselves. Instead of getting a broken, open world, online-only, half finished story and microtransaction infested festival. The graphics are top notch. The RE engine is a beast of a game engine. The soundtrack is one of my favourite parts since it's just catchy and get's you in the mood during the fights.

Playing as three drastically different characters was also pretty interesting. Nero was a bit difficult to handle at first but I really found myself using the punching arm and the rawhide since they really do help keep your combos stay afloat when things get dicey. V takes a bit to get used to since he doesn't directly fight but only finishes off the enemies. Once you understand how he works, you can do some really crazy cool combos and deal a lotta damage. Then there is Dante who was a good amount of swords, guns and different styles to use during combat. He is the most complex character to play since the possibilities are almost endless with him. I really enjoyed all three of them and liked how they were switched on and off in a very inconsistent way so it's not completely predictable. The "cameo system" is also pretty sweet where you can see other players in the distant fighting playing as someone else or they join you in the middle of some fights.

After I beat the game on Devil Hunter, it made me really want to get better at it. Some of those last fights I got wrecked. Since the game does have 3 other difficulties to unlock besides the two default ones. We also have the upcoming free DLC Bloody Palace which is gonna be pretty fun!

This game is a must if you love action games. It's great to see DMC make a huge comeback after being dormant for a long time. I wasn't that big of a fan of the reboot. I just thought they really ruined the characters but the gameplay and everything else was fine. Seeing Capcom actually make good games has me pretty excited for the future for their games and upcoming ones!

This review comes from someone who grew up with the series and played 3,4 and DmC 2013 so many times I can barely count.

I have invested 2 months of almost daily playing into the game on my PS4 before I got into pc gaming, so sadly I don't have the hours I actually played this game.

Basically, for 5 Capcom took everything we liked from previous titles gameplay wise and put it into one game. There is nothing more satisfying when you're finally done getting every skill for the 3 playable characters or the one you enjoy the most and you start seeing your improvment with the combos and the whole playing system - especially for new fans. 5 feels like one of the most friendliest for newcommers the series has ever had.

The effects are so so stunning. The RE engine is literally reason I'm saving up for a better graphic card. The cutscenes are a LOT which I personally enjoyed. It feels like a small movie, while older DMC games where a lot of playing and less cutscenes. This is something that depens on preference! It is not overwhelming, yet a good amount.
Another factor I really appreciate is that for the returning main characters, Dante, Vergil and Nero, the voice actors stayed the same. If you're a fan, this particular aspect feels different. I had a lot of flashbacks from 10 year old me smashing buttons in DMC4.

The only negative thing 5 has to me is how it handles 3 playable characters. It bugs me a little that you cannot decide for every mission who you want to play. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed both Dante and Nero's gameplay - V not so much, but that is a preference thing once again - but whenever you get good at one style or a certain move (Dante: Aggressive and offensive, Nero: A lot of timing and basically air fighting, V: defensive), you get pulled out of it, since you now have to play a different character. The only moments you can choose are Mission 7 between Nero and V and Mission 13 between all 3, to adjust to your personal fighting style. It really bugs me, but it is something you can avoid once you've played through the game or one difficulty. I don't complain much about it since I cannot change it, but it is worth noting. What I do is just play the levels of one characters so that I keep the same fighting style for longer than 1-2 hours.

Another noteworthy thing is that 5 brings a lot of the story from 1 to 4 together. Basically this means: A lot of people who aren't fan of the series won't understand a lot of hidden things and both obvious things happening. 5's plot feels like after the 11 year pause the creators wanted to put a point to a lot of things that have happened in the past or are left unanswered and finally fill them with answers. This leads to the fact that, of course, if you're new and haven't had all these questions since you haven't seen the things to raise questions, you might feel like the story is underwhelming.
Even as a big fan I think it is. The plot is easily summed up in a few words and not a lot happens if you look at it in a neutral way, but if you watch it as someone who knows about the story, it feels satisfying to get answers to so many things.

TLDR: I love, love the game so much that I've just written my first review ever for a game so more people can see it. I'm a fan of two of capcom's most wellknown franchises, but I'm sad how much less known DMC is.

Probably the best hack n slash of all time:
- Stunning visuals as well as a surprising amount of detail both in its mechanics and animation.
- Awesome soundtrack that has reached out to many millions beyond the game.
- Wonderful characters set in a solid story that shows their bold and hilarious personalities.
- Timeless gameplay with incredible mechanics that have set the bar very high for future action games.

Also bless the modding community for giving us better features than the special edition we were denied. Ya'll saved this game.

Horas e horas tentando entender um desafio que me pus a solucionar, esse desafio era um notebook, o problema era descobrir qual era o desafio a cumprir, quando estava quase desistindo de arrumar o bichano, descubro que era um problema na bios.
Pego minha mochilha, e vou até o colégio para entregar o notebook da minha amiga, mas ao abrir a mochila percebo que esqueci o carregador Grr, sem pensar muito retiro minha garrafinha de água e encaminho meu corpo para o sol.
Meu objetivo era voltar em casa e agarrar o carregador, porém quando chego em casa oxalá! DMC tinha baixado logo ignoro todas as plantas daninhas, assim iniciando o ritual de jogar.
Deveras bom!!!.

This game saved my life, I'm playing this for the second time..

I am 28.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my "labor". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This amazing game helped me realize that.

That's all, thank you for reading it,

dante in DMC5 is such a complex character that he could carry the entire game himself, but just to prove that DMC is really back, the game also gives you a newly upgraded nero -- as well as an emo kid who surfs on his pet panther and has a dedicated button for reciting william blake poetry.

this is one of the greatest action games of all time

This is the first game I played in this series, and I think I became a fan of the Devil May Cry game series,

The game is great and very fun, the gameplay is great, and I enjoyed playing V more than Dante and Nero, the cinematic scenes are more than perfect, I did not lift my finger from the F12 button, every time a cinematic scenes started, every frame is suitable to be a screenshot!,

And the story is, one of the best game stories I've played this year, and all I can say in the game's story is,
The devil made ME cry!.

definitely worth it 9/10

DMC5 is just a blast.
The combat is the main selling point of this game. There is just no other game with combat like this. It is just so satisfying and fun to defeat the enemies with style.
For me, there is one aspect of the game that is even better than the combat. This is the music. Songs like "Devil Trigger" and "Bury The Light" are the reason I learned about this game in the first place. Bury The Light is one of my favorite songs of all time now. It really deserves the title of "The New Rules of Nature."
The story of DMC5 is actually better than I expected after talking to some friends about it. Sure it's not super profound or filled with a lot of things that make you reflect on it, but it is still a well written story. It's like a page turner book where you keep wanting to learn more and more and as more and more things are revealed you go, "Oooh so it was that all along!"
Overall, DMC5 is a fantastic game with stellar game play, a story that is gripping but not too deep, and music that is so good its worth buying the game just to hear it. Give DMC5 a try - it's a Smokin' Sexy great game!

Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition is not coming to PC. With the exception of the Vergil DLC.

Seriously Capcom, is this how you thank your PC supporters? you had a staggering 89k peak on launch day on steam. Not many games achieve such a high peak on launch day these days. People gave your game a very high rating, rightfully so. AND YET! you still throw bones at us.

Now granted, Vergil being playable is the meat part of the Special Edition, but it still feels like we're being treated as second class citizens in this instance.

I am really disappointed by this decision. You have lost a lot of respect from me, Capcom.

no letting upgrade to special edition or given any enhancements into pc version is the worst behavior from capcom, people spent same amount of money as on consoles, so all should get same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ content. i see some things getting out of hand lately, so i hope people can be smart enough and do not support ♥♥♥♥♥ like this from any company.

A homeless man, a cripple, and an Edgar Allen Poe fan all walk into a tree to stop a demon from eating his fruit. Will they succeed? Play this super stylish action filled game to find out. The game that just gets better each subsequent play thru and is a total joy to master. Seriously, play this game.

No Turbo mode and LDK update? Thanks Capcom for this anti-consumer move. I'm sure that making PC versions of your games obsolete only 18 months after their release will greatly improve your sales on steam.

A good hack and slash game, really enjoyed this game, and the devil trigger song was awesome so was Nico

+ OST
+ Graphics, character modelling
+ action and fight controls are smoother than previous installments.

Its a treat for die hard DMC fans (not me you can judge that from the review)

- Story was predictable,
- the gameplay becomes bit repetitive after some time, i skipped few enemies in last missions just to face final bosses.
- had few graphical glitches where enemies and a boss had no body rendered only strings and eyes were on it.

Devil May Cry 5 might just be the best entry in the series. A great game for beginners or veterans, this game is the perfect entry point for anyone new to Devil May Cry or people who have been playing for the last 20 years. A masterpiece of the action-adventure genre, DMC5 features 4 playable characters Dante, Nero, V and now with the special edition, Vergil. Every character functions differently and mastering them is a joy. A huge variety of weapons, abilities and upgrades will keep you constantly improving as you move up the difficulties. Visually this game is spectacular with beautifully crafted scenes, incredible ray-tracing lighting and high resolution, matched with blistering frame rates. Devil May Cry 5 is a triumph for Capcom, a ridiculously stylish game with boatloads of content for players of any skill.

DMC 5 is not only the master of the series, but also has made great progress in combat, narrative, level rhythm, and repeated play. It is one of the best action games to date.
Before the release of , it is difficult to imagine that there will be other action games comparable to it.
I can't wait seeing the six-armed Nero of "sin devil trigger" in DMC 6.
CAPCOM, the soul of action forever!

A refreshing jaunt into the land of hack-n-slash, DMCV brings the once-thought-dead series and genre back from the grave and in top form, with flowing combat and stunning visuals for a modern age.

However apparently as a punishment for piracy, Capcom has denied PC players the ability to purchase the Special Edition upgrade of the game, which is currently locked as a next-gen console exclusive only, which brought about two new gamemodes; Turbo Mode and Last Dark Knight Mode, as well as Ray Tracing and other graphical upgrades, on top of Vergil as a new playable character. You can purchase Vergil as a standalone DLC for the PC/Last Gen Console, but that's it.

The only way Turbo/LDK mode can be played on PC is via community made mods that are faithful recreations of these modes. Which also usually break every time Capcom pushes out a patch for the PC version. If you wanna deal with setting up third party modding tools, dealing with installation and management of them, more power to you. And for the Ray tracing/graphical upgrade mods for PC... there are no mods. Yet.

If you own a next-gen console, just go buy the game there, I guess. Otherwise it's up to you. The game is pretty cheap now at only $25, compared to the $60 it was at launch.

Also worth noting, the game is notoriously short. I understand Hack N' Slashes get their value through constant replayability, honing your skills and turning combat into a flowing spectacle of death, but this game made me feel like I was left high and dry after beating it the first time. My exact words on getting to the ending was "Hold on, is that really it? It's done already?" The entire game comes off as one massive bait for the inevitably way cooler sequel Capcom is gonna squeeze out some point in the future, and that DMCV was just testing the consumer waters a bit.

Its hard to believe this game actually came into reality.

I've been waiting for a sequel to DMC4 for 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years. It seemed like yesterday when i was blown away by DMC4, It was one of my first PC games and I had been a big fan of DMC since the PS2. DMC3 is one of my most favourite games ever, and this game is a return to form that I can't help but wish for more.

Devil May Cry is the sort of game that rewards you for putting in the work. Variety is your tool to style on the enemies. You're missing out on a huge chunk of the fun by not learning the intricate movesets of the characters. Itsuno's philosophy of making you be on the same level as the characters on the cutscenes is amazing and surprises me how much of that ideal is poured into this game. The polish and craft of 5 years shows in this like a cherry on top of this devilishly stylish game.

The few gripes that I have are so minor to the sheer fun that I had with this game. My hatred with the fortuna castle grapple point ceiling puzzle is gone, no more disappearing platforms that send you to fight enemies in a room and have to try again. The level design is just there to provide you with the perfect playground to blast through the enemies with style.
My only disappointment is that the ladies didn't get that many scenes in of them doing cool stuff. But i'm glad that they focused on showering the money on the 3 characters that you play doing cool stuff around Redgrave City.

I'm surprised by the name as well as the absolute madmen at capcom basically saying that every single piece of DMC media before it is canon. Even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Anime that is so disappointing gets some small cameos in this.
If you want to feel what a true Capcom game feels like, I'd say DMC5 and RE2remake are the best aquisitions of the year easily.

This party is getting CRAZY!

what are you waiting for?

Nice game, I know. I bought it for an expensive price. I cant decide whether to play the Special Edition version or Steam ver.

I love Capcom. It would be better if he had country specific pricing. Game prices are quite high. The price of this game was like a d... on my a.. I didnt forget.

In one word this game is amazing , bringing back lots of old memories.
Story: So far so good, presentation is as expected. Cut scenes are flawless.
Graphics: Well optimized ,even a low spec pc will calmly handle this game. I am playing on at 4k 60 fps with HDR flawlessly.
Gameplay: same as previous games, you can play with different characters i believe. When it comes to hack and slash nothing can beat DMC 😍
Capcom put tremendous efforts to make this game and i have no regrets buying this game.

This keeps getting better and better...

If you are reading this I guess you have played at least one previows DMC game (forget DmC pls), if not I guess this review it will be a little bigger than.

For those who already played any dmc games before, this game should be played by you.
The graphics are amazing, the Dante gameplay is like Dmc 4 but with more weapons and combos.
Nero is "stronger" with a little different gameplay, but stylish :D
And we have a different character with a very different gameplay from the others every seen; we're talking about V. He attacks at long-rage with his "pets", but to kill the enemys he needs to do it by it self (it's like: pets do damage on the enemy and then it's the part "FINISH HIM" and V goes and finishs them :D)
The story is amazing too, Vergil is back, always searching for more power.

For those who never played any dmc game before, this game might be for you
First you need to be sure if you like hack & slash games;
Second, make sure you play at least one of the previous games or watch some gameplay to understand a little of the story
Third, be a stylish guy - optional since I saw many people just spamming :(
Forth, start in the easiest difficult so you can learn how the game works :D

In conclusion, this game is awesome (amazing graphics, gameplay, storyline and maby a chalange for many)

REVIEW: 9.5/10
(Since it has big loading screens)


EDIT: Since capcom said dmc5se will only be avaiable on ps5 and new xbox with
- Vergil as a playable character
- Turbo mode
- Legendary Dark Knight difficulty

People started changing their reviews since pc and ps4 will only get vergil as a paid dlc later and not the rest....
In my opinion that doesn't really matter, all phatforms should have his own exclusive like nintendo with dmc3 style switcher; of course you can get all of those with mods but some don't like mods since they are made by the community and not the company it self. Many say Capcom doesnt even care about pc.... As I said, for me, all platforms should have a exclusive and PC had in the past on dmc4 vanilla, the same exclusives dmc5se will have....
"Turbo and Legendary Dark Knight difficulty" and other stuff only pc can have (high resolutions,high framerate,performance test,..). And I know no one spoke bad of capcom when dmc4 came to pc saying "capcom doesnt care about consoles" like they are doing now to pc....
We should be thankfull for capcom decided to make a vergil a paid dlc for pc and ps4 and not a exclusive for ps5 because if it was many would buy ps5 thinking on vergil.

After 7 years of a failed reboot and 11 years of blue-balls, It's finally here.
The real Devil May Cry is back!

Capcom has poured c*m ,sweat and tears into this magnum opus of a game and you can see the end result quite clearly.

If you're worried about optimization issues then don't fear, the game runs quite well on GTX 1060 at ultra/high mixed settings, getting around 94-120 fps or so on the latest drivers.

Edit 1: Keyboard and Mouse controls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ phenomenal, finally.

Edit 2 : V is really satisfying to play as, clearly he was designed for newcomers and old school fans alike.

Having completed the game, it's safe to say that this is the best game in the franchise.

I am getting sick and tired of every single developer pushing this exclusivity agenda that literally ruined the gaming market twice by now. (Hell why don’t you go ahead and put Special Edition on PC but make it Epic exclusive aswell eh?)

Maybe i’ll change this review if Capcom stops boasting new consoles like they were made by God ♥♥♥♥♥♥ incarnate with the divine purpose of doing something THE PC COULD DO SINCE TWO YEARS AGO.
Until then let’s just try realizing that their apology made no sense, and served only to satisfy the greed machine that keeps spinning in place until someone knocks them the hell off their high horse, i for one definitely won’t be buying into Vergil (as great as his battle theme is.)

Ps: Gutting a DMC game permanently of Turbo and Legendary dark knight mode is like expecting a man to win the olympics after breaking their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ legs.

What a return to form!
Very accessible but with true-to-form incredibly high skill ceiling, as well as having the single best implementation of the bloody palace in the series.
Extremely fun! I doubt bayonetta 3 will be able to touch this, but I will surely be getting that as well.

It is just incredible how they managed to have good environments that feel nice to explore while at the same time not having them be so annoyingy convoluted and backtracky, they just flow into the next encounter, and let me tell you, the encounters are fantastic, the combat is probably the best in the series, particularly when you do get all of Nero's moves.

V is a really interesting character type, and I really hope that they expand on his arsenal in the future, maybe in Dragon's Dogma 2, that would be pretty fantastic.


Now, if they pulled up a DMC4 SE thing and made Lady and Trish playable, well, that would be just peachy.

Devil May Cry 5 is a fantastic hack and slash game that literally checks every box you could possibly want out of a game in 2019. Amazing graphics, extremely well optimized, best in genre gameplay, an interesting story, a great soundtrack, and overall is just fun to play. I am not what you would call a veteran of the franchise, but this is definitely a great entry point for anyone interested in the series. I cannot recommend it enough.

I mean what can I say?

I've always been a fan of DMC and this one is absolutely the best game I've played this year and still currently playing. Even if you complete the game you'll end up playing it again and again just to get that Smokin' Sexy Style! This is by far one of the best hack and slash games in my opinion. Aesthetic af, fun to mix up your own combos, and some humor in the cut scenes every once in a while. This one includes a lot of elements in the previous versions of the game.

>Nero playable
>Dante playable
>Vergil playable (But not the way we wanted)
>Awesome soundtrack

This game is definitely one of the best modern videogames today. Intriguing gameplay, you can play each game character differently, I'm not talking about Dante, whose gameplay is just incredibly fun and crazy. The game still has its form style of music(Music here are just banger). This game just makes me want to play it more and more and more! Makes me want to learn how to play Nero, Dante, V and Virgil to perfection. SSS/10 MUST PLAY!

Like my reviews? Go follow my Curator page.

While I've been familiar with this series for ages, Devil May Cry V was the first game in the series I've played. While I like hack-n-slash games, I don't have much experience with them outside of loving Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and playing a bit of Bayonetta, so I didn't really know what to expect. What I initially started playing as a "side game" to lift my spirits whenever A Plague Tale: Innocence got too emotionally overwhelming, ended up taking over the majority of my gaming free time, and caused me to put Plague Tale on the backburner. It really leans into the "game" part of video games, feeling very reminiscent of DOOM 2016's mentality of "gameplay first, story later", and it ended up being an incredibly fun experience once things started to click.

Graphics

The visuals are not the highlight by any stretch, but they're pretty solid for the most part. The characters look amazing obviously, with an incredible level of detail put into them. The same can be said about the environments, however I will say that I wish the game had more variety in the levels themselves. They all feel very similar, either going the route of being city ruins or the inside of the demons' domain. While it makes sense from a story perspective, as well as it being somewhat alleviated towards the end, I still wish they did more with the environments in this game considering how high quality the visuals themselves are. Surprisingly, I thought the game did a surprisingly good job of not overwhelming the player with visual effects, which I thought would get overbearing due to the emphasis on style and the general absurdity of these games. Overall, the visuals were good, although I wish they had some more variety.

Gameplay

Of course, if you're looking into buying this kind of game, the gameplay is the most crucial aspect to that. And thankfully, Devil May Cry V delivers in spades. There is an insane amount of depth and fluidity to the combat, which gets multiplied when considering that you're playing three different characters throughout the campaign. The quality of the combat alone makes the price of admission worthwhile, and the game knows this. Like DOOM, it focuses almost solely on combat, almost to a fault depending on who you ask. However, this didn't really bother me, because the game's focus on customization means that you can easily change your playstyle on the fly and still get rewarded for it, so while you're restricted to basically nothing but combat, the combat doesn't restrict you. The bosses were also quite enjoyable, and considering some of the horror stories I've heard about some of the bosses in this series, I felt they were almost all consistently good, and were simply mediocre at worst. As far as criticisms go, I will reiterate my wish that the levels had some more variety in them in terms of design (maybe different gimmicks in combat like hazards). I also felt like the parts of the game where you had to play as V weren't as interesting and also exponentially more painful due to the nature of his playstyle, but this is mostly alleviated considering that you're only required to play him for a few chapters. Overall, while I have my criticisms of the gameplay, I can set them aside considering just how incredibly smooth, deep, and plain entertaining the combat is.

Story

The story isn't particularly good, but it didn't really take itself seriously so I had some fun with it at least. There were a few times where I felt like things just happened so the plot can move forward, and there were quite a few characters thrown to the wayside that I thought were pretty major figures in the series, namely Lady and Trish. I also wish some things were more coherently explained (like a certain turning point and major reveal towards the end of the game), but again, I didn't really have any level of expectation for the story. Could it have been a little more thorough in its story while still not taking itself seriously? I think so. And while I can forgive the story for being sort of weak considering how absurd it is, it still feels just a tad bit underdeveloped and could've benefited from an extra scene or two. However, this is not a dealbreaker by any stretch, and is more of a mild gripe than anything.

Audio

The music is fine. Some of it feels like a mess of aggressive noises to "pump you up" or whatever, but certain tunes were quite enjoyable. "Devil Trigger" alone brings this game's audio score up quite a bit, though. The voice acting's pretty good, with everyone doing a pretty good job of leaning into their stereotypical aspects of their character to add to the silliness of the story. There isn't much else to say. Everything that isn't "Devil Trigger" is just fine, I guess.

Content Value

While the game is quite short and there isn't much you can do to make playthroughs different on a basic level, the addition of harder difficulties paired with the aforementioned incredible combat means that you can absolutely get some more out of this game than just a single playthrough. While I have not tested this myself, I believe that harder difficulties give enemies new attacks and do more than just bloat their health and damage, which could further incentivize you to play through the game multiple times. There's absolutely some replay value here that is more than just player-motivated if you enjoy the combat system enough.

Verdict

In conclusion, there isn't a lot to say about Devil May Cry 5 outside of its gameplay. It's an extremely well-made hack-n-slash game that loves leaning in to its sillier side. It's absolutely worth it just for the combat alone, but it's a game that can be simply described as fun. And for a critic like me that often finds meaning in games deeper than just what level of entertainment do they provide, it's nice to have a game like this every so often. Definitely worth a try.

I spent about 2 or 3 hours playing it with my keyboard and mouse and they really did a good job in adapting the controls to pc as it looks better in terms of graphics quality and the hud and everything is understandable and I really liked especially the virgil dlc which is really impressive and I'm looking forward to another game with them, and the osto was really cool.

I loved this game, but I found out today, on the day NVIDIA dropped the new GPUs, specialized in Ray Tracing, that Capcom is only releasing Vergil, and not the SE upgrades on PC. Save yourself the money, and don't buy it unless this changes.

While I did enjoy the game, I felt like it was lacking something, though it's hard to describe what. The presentation is insanely good and the gameplay is fun, but the story is meh and ends on a rather sudden note. The levels are almost all very dark and broody, which I suppose fits the mood, but they lack variety. More levels like the first two or three would have been nice, but they quickly devolve into "dark hallways" or "dark demon places" for the rest of the game.

In the end, a bit more variety in level design would be nice, especially since there is not much exploration either. I also felt like there was some lack of variety in combat, both in terms of enemy types and moves, though I am probably not good enough at the game to really rate that well. The game felt repetitive somewhat quickly, but also isn't really long enough for that to be a huge problem.

For a fun, short, action-filled romp in DMC fashion, you can't go wrong, but I personally enjoyed both DMC games I played before this - DMC 4 and even the previous DMC re-imagining - quite a bit more, though it is hard to put my finger on exactly why. Still quite fun though and the soundtrack is great, so I don't regret my playthrough.

This videogame right here is my favorite single-player experience of all time. Nothing really comes close. DMC5, by all measures, is as close to a masterpiece as I've played in a long, long time. I can't really add much to the discussion about why, the thousands of positive comments will do that job for me.

This is a game that I recommend to all of my friends, and that's probably going to be the case for a long, long time. It's just that sick. However, PC is unfortunately going to be last place I recommend playing the game with the coming news about SE.

Realistically speaking, the only reason to get this game on PC right now is if you never plan on getting it on PS5 or the new XBOX. At least, officially. Modders have consistently shown their Motivation™ more that Capcom could even dream. So, maybe the modding community can scratch that itch. Regardless, it still stings that PC does not appear to be getting LDK or Turbo (the one I'm personally the most bummed about.)

Yeah, when Vergil comes out, I'll definitely be buying and playing the hell out of him, but only because this is the version of the game I'm now stuck playing.

tl;dr: Fantastic game that you should just get on a different platform. Capcom is deadweight.

I´m a big DMC fan, always have been, but just because I prefer to play on PC I´m treated like a 2nd class citizen by Capcom. I´m sorry, but even with 2000h spent on this game, I can´t recommend it to anyone until Capcom announces all Special Edition features for PC players too.

A largely triumphant return to form for the first and foremost character action series. While I didn't outright hate what some consider to be the completely disastrous reboot from Ninja Theory, the issues with its characterization and writing were insurmountable. That is far less of a problem in DMC 5, a fine example to other large gaming companies of what happens when you just cut the malarkey and give fans what they want.

For those unfamiliar, DMC is the sometimes edgy, sometimes cheesy, and always entertaining story of twin brothers, Dante and Vergil, the sons of legendary demon swordsman Sparda and his human wife Eva. The first game saw you control only Dante, but each iteration since has added additional playable characters with increasingly divergent gameplay from our white-haired, red-coated, wisecracking leading man. In each iteration, you battle demon hordes and bosses using a mixture of firearms and demonic melee weaponry, obtain red orbs to purchase new moves and attacks, and progress through gothic and hellish environments in various states of disrepair. Many characters can activate a signature super mode called "Devil Trigger", enhancing their attacks and often making new ones temporarily available. The series as a rule is difficult to play and even more so to play well, relying on a combo system where varying your moves and avoiding taking damage increases your ranking. As a kid playing the first game, I barely scraped through Easy Auto my first time playing and with practice and repeated playthroughs, I was eventually able to beat the game on Hard.

This fifth numbered entry sees the return of Dante and Nero, a young gun, with a demonic right arm, a very large revolver, a sword with a motorcycle engine built into it and a chip on his shoulder, first introduced in DMC 4. Joining them is newcomer V, a sickly goth with a penchant for poetry and controlling demons to do the fighting for him. Together, they must stop the growth of the Qliphoth- an enormous, destructive demonic tree that has taken root in Red Grave city, a blighted burg with a connection to the heroes' past. The story features at least token appearances by characters, enemies and references events throughout the series, including the anime and even the light novels, and even deigns to mention DMC 2 in its "Previously on DMC" cutscene, a game almost totally ignored otherwise by both Capcom and series fans.

DMC 5 is probably the biggest and most diverse offering in the series to date, with a total of four different playable characters if you include the Vergil DLC, a 20 mission campaign, a bunch of secret missions, a full wave survival mode the series calls "Bloody Palace", and even a training area where you can try out new moves before purchase and adjust enemy types and behaviors to see the resulting effects. It also includes a sort of half-assed coop mode where any time the characters would cross paths in the campaign missions, the role of whichever characters you're not playing can be taken by random other players, with the option to have the game prioritize people from your friends list.

DMC 5 is at once more accessible then earlier titles, especially the first and second games, and also harder. Gold Orbs, used to revive your player to full health are much more plentiful then before, and you can even receive extra ones if other players rate you as "stylish" after playing with them, so you are far less likely to get an actual game over and have to restart a mission- which is good, because DMC 5 stops playing around at about mission 14, and I was unable to finish most missions after that, even with the intentionally overpowered Vergil, without using at least one Gold Orb, usually during boss fights. The last few bosses are similar to those of Monster Hunter World, with heavy attacks that knock you around with few openings for you to attack between them. In addition, there are fewer ways to safely cheese most fights that you could do in earlier entries, such as when I used Ebony & Ivory, Dante's twin pistols, exclusively to chip down the health of the Cerberus boss in DMC 3.

While many enemies can be safely pummeled into oblivion without fear of reprisal, especially when using Vergil's Yamato sword, A few enemies are much harder to stagger and will force you to start paying attention to what you're doing, and if you can't parry them with timed attacks of your own, block using Dante's Royalguard style, grab them out of their animation with Nero's Devil Breaker arm, etc, or just keep your distance, you're going to have to get good at dodging, and dodging in DMC is honestly rather awkward in comparison to some games due to its revolving around the game's lock on system. There is seemingly no simple backdodge move, though some characters can do so as part of a "step back and then dash in as a counter" move. More likely you'll have to side dodge or jump over an attack, and some attacks cannot be evaded by one or the other, or can even be evaded at all if you're too close. Reading enemy movements and tells becomes paramount as you progress.

Finishing DMC 5 on the default "Devil Hunter" difficulty was ultimately not too stressful except maybe for my thumbs, though having used 6ish Gold Orbs in both vanilla and Vergil mode I have to wonder how good I actually was at the game. Good enough to not run out of Gold Orbs, I suppose. DMC 5 wants you to finish its story, but if you want to get good and say, S rank every mission or play on harder difficulties, thats on you.

I didn't buy DMC 5 when it first released. In fact I waited on it for quite a while, not only because of the typical price of a new AAA release but because of the presence of Denuvo DRM, later patched out, the presence of which is infamous for causing system issues on many people's computers. As a friend of mine often points out, Capcom occasionally does the right thing for their games- they just seldom learn from the experience.

DMC 5 is a good time over all and I recommend it to both series veterans and those looking to get into the character/stylish action genre for the first time, as it has something to offer both and probably most folks in between, if you can handle a game that's a bit harder then some. I can assure you that you'll fare better then the typical paid reviewer, at least, if you are capable of paying even a modicum of attention. You'll also get to hear a certain oft-memed and very catchy fight theme.

The Vergil DLC is also worth a purchase, playing him lets you effortlessly breeze through most encounters and even some bosses that gave me pause as the other characters, though last two missions are just as challenging, if not more so, then playing them in the base game. He has access to the same set of weapons used in the Special Edition release of DMC 3, but with a host of new moves for each, a doppleganger summon, a "concentration" bar that allows him to build attack damage through landing successful attacks and avoiding damage, and hilariously powerful, screen-clearing finishers. However, Vergil's missions do not use the coop "link" function.

I absolutely love this game and have recommended it to many players.

However what Capcom is doing right now with only bringing the Special Edition to consoles is a slap in the face to their customers on PC. There is absolutely no reason to lock it to consoles. In fact PC would benefit far more from the raytracing being implemented.

Bring the Special Edition to PC and I'll change my review.

If you want to play an action game that feels rewarding from when you first start out 'til you become a complete master, this is it right here.

Story
If you know nothing about the Devil May Cry series, you don't need to play the previous ones for story, as story isn't the main point of the Devil May Cry series and neither are you missing out on any important narrative exposition. The story is purposefully written to be campy, but also fun at the same time, so don't expect a nobel prize for literature, just sit back and have fun with it.

Audio
There isn't much to say about the audio other than praise. None of the sound effects are annoying, there are even audio cues to help with hearing enemies being summoned, dodging enemies and even timing your combos. The music is 10/10. I enjoy listening to all the characters themes (yes even Dante's) Most of the community / fan base from what I see also highly praise the OST.

Game Play
For some, the because you can complete the main campaign in about 6 hours on average for new players (maybe less) they don't see the game as having much replay value. The replay value isn't about playing the campaign, it's about challenging yourself to higher difficulties and trials. As you play the game and play the different characters, you'll start to get better at their toolkit, you'll see and understand enemy attack patters and you'll devise stylish / efficient ways to beat them. The game play is fun enough that you'll want to see how far you can go with your skills in the game even past playing the campaign once. You'll want to play it the second time on the higher difficulty. Heck you may even try bloody palace, which is a 100 floors of increasing difficult challenges. Once you become very familiar with your character and fighting mobs / bosses, you'll start to not only survive, but style on them, and let me tell you, there is a huge rush of dopamine killing a boss without getting hit and achieving the highest rank on something you once struggled with.

tldr
If you're the type of person that doesn't want a challenge, there isn't much replay value in this game for you, especially if you aren't a fan of the DMC series.

Savior! Bloodstain! Hellfire! Shadow!
Heaven on a landslide!

Devil may cry is back with this incredible, powerful, furious, beautiful, fast, dark, epic, and just DEVILISH comeback that I have been waiting for so long. This game is art in many meanings of that word. Music is complete kick-ass experience. Plot is good. Characters are great. V is perfect. is still as devil triggering as he was. Mechanics are polished. Possibility to replay it over and over again is on a new level in comparison to previous game. The only thing that 's a little bit sad is lack of additional content, but on the other hand the base game can offer you a lot of frustration and wasted hours(in a good way) so this lack is kinda might be questionable. Game is definitely good and worth a shot. Also in my opinion DMC5 was the main competitor of Resident evil 2 in a fight for a place of best game of 2019.

Highly recommended for longtime fans of the series. Recommended for people curious about it and do not mind a game where the emphasis is more on the gameplay and replayability than the story itself or the length of one playthrough.

Combat is great for all 3 characters. V takes a little getting used to but once you do he is highly enjoyable to play and not as slow as the trailer showing him off made him appear (probably due to them showing him mostly moving around in his lock-on walk speed). Music is great. And there are plenty of both hilarious and hype moments (especially towards the end). Sure the story is all right at best and longtime fans probably guessed certain story beats when certain things were announced but, again, you do not play DMC games for the story.

As good as 3 and 4, better than the reboot, and blows DMC 2 out of the water.

Definitely worth the wait. Capcom has delivered, and completely rekt (with few funny references) DmC :D Gameplay is fun, I don't like V's gameplay but dante, nero is awesome to play.

Also you can buy and choose your own battle music,what is more epic than litening to Ultra vIolet when you are stylishly killing mobs?

10/10, no backtracking, improved gameplay sinc DMC4.

I'm at mission 18 and I'm a little surprised this game gets such high praises. So far, I am really disappointed by this game and can't recommend it. I mean yea it has nice graphics and the combat is good, but... ohh well

Cons
-For me DMC is much more than just combat. I loved gothic style of DMC1/3 with light metroidvania level design. Sadly, DMC5 doesn't have anything of that. It's almost exclusively narrow corridors between combat arenas where you simply has to get from point A to B, and sadly, it gets boring and repetitive at mission 3 already. Not to mention, that there are only two settings: City (first part of the game) and Demon-Construction-ish (second part), which makes every level feel the same. The Demon-Construction is the worst offender, because the whole environment is using the same texture. Overall, it's the worst level design in the series so far.
-Combat, while good, didn't change in almost any way compared to DMC4. Dante is basically the same as in 4, the same moveset with just some very minor changes and new weapons. Nero will probably get one additional ability later in the game, but so far, he is basically the same as in previous game. V is really cool and different form other characters, but his moveset is clearly underdeveloped.
-Only one memorable boss fight so far

Pros
+many enemies return from previous entries, which makes this game bestiary a collection of "the best of DMC" with some nice additions and modifications, and I'm perfectly fine with that.
+cutscenes are really well done

Split
+/- many bosses and sub bosses, but they fail to be memorable
+/- V playstyle
+/- online component - it's cool to see other characters do their story thing in the background of your level (controlled by other players), but this is hugely underdeveloped feature. You will hardly ever actually see them (but you know they are there, because of message in the corner), and their action have no consequences in your level (you don't actually help each other in any way) - unless there is actually a way to play levels together - but I didn't discover it yet

While the game has its good moments, and is fun to play due to how the combat system is built, i can hardly recommend the game due to the company that is selling the game making some questionable practices, including but not limited to
.
- forcing people to buy the game with microtransaction bs tacked on to make it harder to refund
- removing the game from sale and then selling only the high red orb pack, making the ACTUAL price go to the old price.
- the recent fiasco with the special edition. gating features behind exclusivity is another layer of bs i won't tolerate.

needless to say, there is only so much abuse you can receive from a company before you stop giving a ♥♥♥♥♥. never again...

The best DMC game. The smoothest gameplay with the best graphics out there. RE Engine is king. Everything a DMC fan dreamt off. We have been blessed and the only way to repay is buying as many copies as you can. DMC IS BACK!

The game's director, Hideaki Itsuno, famously said on Microsoft E3 2018 stage that this is the best game he's ever made, not only did he achieve that goal, he SURPASSED it.

This is a game made by fans, for fans.

If you're a fan, you already bought it, if not then this is the best time to start.

And thank you Itsuno-san for bringing back the Cerberus!

EDIT: WHEN ARE WE GETTING TRISH AND LADY AS PLAYABLE CHARACTER DLC!?

Hate to do this for a game I love but I cannot in good conscience recommend putting money in Capcom's pocket after they've yet again made it clear that PC players are second class customers to them. Sure, we get the Vergil DLC "at a later date" but the fact that we don't get official ray tracing support, turbo mode or LDK mode as offered by the Special Edition, because it's strictly staying on PS5 and Xbox, is absolutely unacceptable.

Will consider changing this review should they backtrack on that decision, but frankly, I probably won't because they shouldn't be pulling this BS in the first place.

Easily one of the best games of the generation and the very best action game to date.

Highly recommended to any Action fan, any DMC fan and honestly anyone who wants a good romp, the game runs fantastic on PC, looks amazing and is a joy to play and master.

Game was great, but not bringing the new Special Edition to PC (even as a paid upgrade) is ducking stupid. It's DmC: Definitive Edition all over again. Not cool at all considering the game sold 1 million copies on PC.

DO NOT SUPPORT CAPCOM UNTIL THEY RELEASE THE SPECIAL EDITION FEATURES FOR PC!

Capcom is basically giving us the middle finger for supporting them.

So Capcom, since you can't charge PC players for high settings with the "free but not really free next-gen upgrade edition", you just blame on the "magical architecture" of the new consoles?

Yeah, ray tracing and SSDs...what a witchcraft!

Nice game. Awful company. DO NOT SUPPORT IT.

DMC 5 is the best DMC in almost every way.
+Slightly easier to pull off advanced moves/combos than in other DMCs
+Nero now has 12 devil breakers to choose from and each comes with different abilities such as electric blasts, anti-armor drill, and evasive propulsion.
+DMC 5 uses the RE engine, the same engine used in Resident Evil 2 remake.
+Easiest DMC in the series by far, good for those looking for less challenge
+There aren't many major story developments, but the developments that do occur are major. Many claim Nero is more like-able in DMC 5 than in 4.

-For DMC vets looking for a challenge, DMC 5 is way too easy and boring at times. On a no-item run, the difficulty picks up at the last boss on hard mode. DMD mode no item run is HARD and comparable to DMC 3's DMD mode.
-Uninspired enemy design
-Uninspired environments
-Most Bosses have no personality. They are mind-less demons out to destroy you.

This game is freaking awesome!
I'm new to the series and didn't play the 4 older games. Even though the game has a recap of DMC video, I didn't actually understand much from it. If your new to the series I highly recommend watching this video:

YouTube™ Video: Devil May Cry Story Summary - What You Need to Know to Play Devil May Cry 5! 
Views: 1,590,278
Support me on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/suggestivegaming Follow me on Twitter! https://twitter.com/SuggestiveGames Dante and all his friends are back, baby!
I watched it a few times and was instantly involved in the lore and the characters. I promise you will love the game more if you know the lore.

About the game:
The game has 3 difficulties - Human, Devil hunter, and if you finish the game in DH mode, you unlock Son of Sparda mode, so there's tons of replayability and also tons of skills to be unlocked. Apart from that-
Graphics/Character models - 11/10 (very detailed)
Combat - 11/10 (very satisfying)
Story/writing - 11/10 (very humorous)
Cut scenes - 11/10 (f#cking badass)

I've been playing this franchise since I was 4-5 years old, and this might be my favourite entry of the series... only to learn that because I own the game on PC I won't be able to get the upgrade & special edition even though I bought all of them. Capcom is telling me that to be a faithful fan if I want the complete and final product i'll have to spend an extra $500 on a console that's weaker than my pc. Absolutely mind boggling. I hope they fix this because as someone who's loved their games and series for years and has meant the world to me I feel kind of betrayed.

What a game. Looks like CAPCOM have a good start in 2019.
RE 2 and now this?

DMC 5 not DmC . This is continuation that the fan deserved after DMC 4.
The storyline
The gameplay mechanic
The environment
The graphic
The soundtrack etc.

The introduction of V is quite refreshing where you fight with a summon beast/demon. I like it.
I enjoyed every piece of it from start to end. Really felt that my money worth.
No crash from start to end.

Although i do think that this game could be a bit overwhelming for new player who starts jumping into DMC series.
Especially playing Dante. Its a fast pace game where if you cant execute the right move quickly, you are wide open and enemy hit you. Even saw someone said this game is hard because there is no "evade button" .

If you are new to the series, take your time familiarizing the mechanic in training mode just to lock in the muscle memory.
Previous player from DMC4 knows well that the mechanic is still more or less the same from previous game.

Last but not least if you are DMC fans and cant buy it at full price, you damn sure need to buy it on sale.
