After more than 1000 hours, 3 shark cards invested, no mod, or exploit used ever I was banned, account reset, everything lost, no explanation given, ticket closed by support: " banning decisions are final and may not be appealed"
Grand theft indeed, of your time and money.

I just passed the 2000h playtime. So, I decided to write a review in brief.

Fun game but damn, it has a cancer Community like a shet.
If you want to enjoy this game with friends, make a private session. So, no any level +1000 kid who thinks hes Thanos and annoy you. Have Fun!

I've been playing this game for 3 years, never modded, glitched, hacked, etc. Still got banned for God knows why.
Tried Rockstar's support and all I got were automatic responses saying "All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed" and "In addition to being suspended, all GTA Online characters, progress and inventory on PC will be reset".
So basically it doesn't matter if you play fair and honest, if theirs stupid anti-cheat go full ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and ban you, there's NOTHING you can do about it. All your progress and time invested is simply gone.
Don't get me wrong, the game IS fun, but Rockstar's lack of support and care for the community is simply DISGUSTING.

Modders have ruined GTA Online in every way imaginable.

Things you should expect while playing online:

*Having your IP address and location stolen
*Having your name used to be blamed for blowing up entire lobbies
*Having your name used to say anything without restriction in chat
*Broken lobbies from injected scripts
*Kicked from becoming MC/CEO for almost an hour
*Getting ejected from your own aircraft and vehicles
*Have all weapons taken away
*Be put into bad sport lobbies for weeks
*Getting locked into cages or stuck in place unable to move
*Getting blown up repeatedly with an explosion loop
*Have irremovable campfires spawned on your player model
*Have a bunch of clones spawned on you
*Have objects spawned into the world that will only disappear by restarting the game
*Attacked by players with ESP, aimbot, and godmode
*Sent back to single player or crashed game for reporting modders, which they block from ever going through
*Be stalked by undetectable modders that follow you when changing lobbies to crash your game
*Getting stuck loading into lobbies indefinitely
*Have your cargo remotely blown up at any given time

Rockstar support won't help you with any of this, if you can even get their website to submit a ticket, they will direct you to verify file integrity every single time.

This review will be removed if and when the issues I'm going to write about has been addressed by Rockstar Games,

Currently GTA:Online for PC has next to no serious attention from Rockstar Games on the topic of anti-cheat, anti-grief, anti-mod within GTA:Online. and as of today (day of writing) It has come under my attention that Rockstar has failed to properly protect the personal information, location details, IP addresses and other information of its users. Malicious player can obtain a lot of sensitive personal information by use of common mod-menus for GTA Online. Currently Rockstar Games has not acknowledged or addressed this matter via any of their social media platforms, direct email or via a PR spokesperson.

Worst thing is that you can fall victim of this without even knowing it. all a malicious modder need to know is your Social Club ID or In-Game Nickname.

Rockstar has the means to combat this, but has failed to do so for many years.

I will leave a youtube video about this topic here:

YouTube‚Ñ¢ Video:  
Views: 0
and in the comment below this review from GTA V Speedrunner and rockstar fan 'DarkViperAU'. who has spoken with people who have access to these mod-menus/tools and brought it under attention to his following.

Personal accounts with this issue:
I myself have also fallen victim to this issue. This happend a couple weeks ago as per writing of this review. I was streaming GTA Online gameplay on twitch and via the stream a malicious person saw my socialclub name in the stream and started targeting me, joining my FRIENDS ONLY session whilest not being part of my friends list. masking his name by replacing it with racial profanity and harrasing me with gameplay exploits and other nasties. blowing me up, hunting me down in godmode and finally crashing my game. after that I switched my stream over to a single player game because I already have put one and two together.

Thanks for reading. Any questions I will try to anwser. I love Rockstar Games and there games but this is bad beyond believes.

EDIT: Here is a link to a guide I have writen a while ago on how to get a 'public solo session' to avoid modders and griefers messing with you. this is the best way to protect yourself currently within GTAO if you enjoy the game like I do and wish to remain playing it.

How to get a empty public session. (Great for Solo Grind) 
A Guide for Grand Theft Auto V
By: Peanut butter & Joelly ‚ö° 135
This guide will explain how to get an empty public session in GTA Online, perfect for CEO Crates, Car sourcing and MC Clubhouse jobs.


Avoiding Modders in GTA Online (With Guardian) 
A Guide for Grand Theft Auto V
By: Peanut butter & Joelly ‚ö° 135
This guide will detail how to avoid modders in GTA Online without losing the ability to play with your friends using guardian. (Fast Load Fixed Version) working in GTA Online build 1.54


Questions I get often under this guide;
Q: Why do you keep playing a game you dislike?
A: I do not dislike GTAV or GTAO, I want it to better.

Q: Why do you keep playing a game you see as a security risk?
A: I know how to weapon myself against the risk and I still enjoy playing GTAO so I do not quit.

Q: Do you have more sources or proof besides the DarkViperAU youtube video?
A: Yes, I will update this guide when I get more content on this topic, preferably from different sources. Including:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_fdhCXlPI0
https://youtu.be/C_fdhCXlPI0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dxa_28MTpw

https://youtu.be/UzfApHLP73w
https://twitter.com/GypsytheScumbag/status/1552089044833779713

Q: Who cares? Online gaming will always be like this.
A: I strongly disagree. while yes, a 100% cheater free online experience doesn't exist I know GTA Online could and should be better. Just look at what the FiveM Community has done, It runs on dedicated servers, has no widespread cheating issues and doesn't save any user data.

Q: What am I supposed to do with the information you have given me?
A: Whatever you want with it. I want to mainly inform you. the games networking is Peer2Peer and has next to no anti-cheat, creating a unfair and toxic online environment for normal players. with privacy risk, banning issues and so much more. I hope it help you to make an informed decision

Edit: I will also start deleting comments that go completely off topic and or consist of personal attacks.

Edit 2: I am aware that the DarkViperAU video has been delisted, Please use/look at the other sources I linked to.

Edit 3: I have disabled comments due to constant stream off topic comments.

I have been playing this game for over 5 years. From PS3 to PC.

I have never cheated or used hacks/mods. And suddenly Rockstar decided to ban me for no reason.

Once my ban is lifted, 5 years worth of progress will be gone.

If they won't rectify this issue, I'm going to turn this into a full-blown media scandal.

EDIT:
Just in case my claim sounds dubious, here's what I was doing in the 24-hours before I got banned:

- I just received the Stone Hatchet and completed the 25-kills challenge (and didn't receive the 250,000 GTA$ bonus for it).
- I received the 750,000 GTA$ moneydrop for watching the official livestream event (https://www.facebook.com/rockstargames/posts/10156559856180097).
- I was promoting my Nightclub and waiting for my supplies to fill up.
- I logged out to take a nap for a couple of hours.
- I woke up, tried to log in again, but the Social Club verification was taking too long, so I quit out of the game and restart.
- When I restart the game, I received the message that my account has been banned for 30 days.

I have sent multiple messsages to Rockstar Support, but all of my tickets were closed immediately with a preformatted response:

- "You did something wrong but we won't tell you exactly what you did."
- "Your account will be reset: Character, Money, EVERYTHING."
- "This is final and cannot be appealed."

So, yes, I'm being banned for something I didn't do and the punishment is 5 years worth of LEGITIMATE PROGRESS, gone.

You can crash the public server by suspending the task on resource monitor for 6 seconds then resume it afterwards and BOOM you have your own solo public server

‚úîNow you can do some selling business peacefully ‚úå
Enjoy ‚ú®

I'm writing this review because there are so many people who just give a negative review for this reason that they cant sell anything in public and there are too many modders in public servers.
They are just struggling and having a bad experience because of griefers.
So i decided to help those new players out üíñ

R* is currently taking legitimate money away from hundreds, possibly thousands of players.
Their cheat detection is flawed and honest players are paying the price for it.

If you're reading this and are skeptic about it, so was I, until it was my turn to pay up.
I play in private sessions only, for the sole reason to avoid cheaters. It didn't help. You'll get your turn.

I do not recommend this game until R* gets their act together.

Edit:
I'd like to add that buying the game for single player is absolutely worth it, but online is simply a mess.

It's been 3 weeks now and R* refuses to acknowledge their error, so I stopped playing and caring. There's no point in playing online if R* can steal your legitimate money away at any time. And the irony is that legitimate players are getting hurt while cheaters are unaffected.

I will never buy another R* game again and I doubt I am the only one. The way they treat their players is ghastly. Their support desk is insulting. It's all about the money, now more than ever.
 

Gotcha!

To those who are thinking of buying this game for online and after seeing the overall reviews being listed as "very positive", if you see this, PLEASE read.

Do not buy this game if you plan to go to gta online, as it is nothing but a hacker-filled cesspool. Your IP and geolocation WILL be leaked by hackers, and Rockstar will not help you. Private game? Nope, Hackers will join you still. If you absolutely must play online, then I beg you, use a VPN, preferably a good one too, as that should keep your personal info safe.

If you only want offline singleplayer, then go ahead, but for the love of any Deity you worship or whatever, do NOT go to GTA online.

As for any Rockstar employee reading this... Fix your feck√≠ng game's netcode, you absolute sh√≠tstains, or better yet, GET SOME DEDICATED SERVERS. Stop swimming in your money pools, and pay attention to what is happening with your game's online mode. People are having PERSONAL info like Zip codes and whatnot leaked, and you are simply allowing it like lazy, pathetic dogs.

If you are looking for a great singleplayer experience, you can ignore this review. You're getting what you pay for there.

If on the other hand you're looking to play GTA Online I cannot recommend the game anymore. It's fun in theory but the way Rockstar handles stuff is just awful. Not only are they completely helpless with the cheater situation in the game but their attempts to stop them actually hit legit players as well. I've earned quite a good amount of in game cash during one of their double money weeks shortly before the last major DLC hit and Rockstar in an attempt to remove cheated/modded money removed 7 million (thats the equivalent of about 80 real life bucks) from my account. In-game money I had earned through their event. I've contacted the support multiple times only to receive responses that either claimed the money was cheated or threatened to ban me.

After about 5 support tickets I gave up. Rockstar Games is scamming their own customers, and that's why I can't recommend being a customer of Rockstar Games anymore. If you already have the game and still play GTA Online I'd recommend doing the following: Go online and search for a cheater willing to give you modded money, proceed to get as much modded money as possible and spend as much of it as you can. Never even think about playing the game legitimately to earn money and for god's sake don't buy shark cards.

Cheers.

Over 1,000 hours on file and I get banned because a man with an airplane sticking out of his crotch locks me in place and dumps money on my head. Yea totally my fault for not logging out, and not Rockstars for not fixing their netcode.

3 years ago... my father bought me this game as a gift for my 17th birthday because I was huge fun of GTA and Rockstar Games.
He also bought game for himself.
I was so happy because I finally got opportunity to play something I wished for years. ( GTA ONLINE )
I played it so hard on "GTA Online" mode with my dad, where I spent around 300 hours of playtime in less than 2 months, maybe even a month.
In time I said above, my character was 107 level, had all guns fully upgraded, had some bussiness, nice cars... etc

Guess what ?

I got banned for 30 days, because they said that I cheat...!

I NEVER used any kind of cheats in any game I or my family paid with REAL MONEY, especially if it is a GIFT!

My father spent around 25 Euros for this game in a way to suprise me + 25 Euros to be able to play with me on GTA ONLINE MODE!

I was totally dissapointed, I wrote a ticket, and they responded me with their 'robot' message saying me that I used cheats and telling me that I have to wait for 30 days to be able to play again... but from ZERO!
BUT HEY! ... I managed to 'survive' without playing GTA V for ENTiRE a MONTH!

Then I finally started again, playing only Races in 'GTA Online' mode for couple of hours then quits.
Next day, when I turned again 'GTA Online' mode I got a nice BLACK SCREEN with BIG WHITE TEXT saying that my account is BANNED PERMANENTLY from GTA Online!

I WAS SHOCKED, again I wrote a ticked and explained the problem, but they just used their useless 'robot' by saying me that this is their final decision...

So from that day, I SWORE TO MYSELF that I would NEVER buy any kind of ANYTHING from Rockstar Games ,and this will remain FOREVER.

I know that you don't give a sh*t about me, which you already proved me with this useless 'robot' Rockstar Support,
but with this 'approach' you are losing many your fellow fans and customers.


NOW LETS TALK ABOUT A GAME ITSELF :

'Single Player' is simply fantastic and there is not anything more to say about it.

'GTA Online' mode was simply something best what GTA Series ever had until the end of 2016 year.

After 2016, Rockstar became hungry for money by adding so many things which regulary doesn't belong to GTA Series anymore... like flying bikes, WW3 tanks, futuristic guns and other sh*t.

This resulted in making this game DISAPPOINTEMENT, by losing all recognizable good sides of GTA Series ( where the cops and criminals was main thing in the game. )

By summarizing impressions... I MUST GIVE YOU A NEGATIVE REVIEW, because 2 reasons I said above. ( 1) Your approach to your fans and customers is dumb and useless, 2) You ruined this game with 'updates' from 2017 to this date. )

Customers, thanks for reading and have a nice day!

Singleplayer is amazing. The story, characters, map. Even after playing over and over again it's still entertaining. I like it way more than the GTA 4's story.

As for online - this is the reason why I don't recommend the game, because I think that most people nowadays buy the game mainly because of the online. Don't get me wrong; I used to love it, played over 400 hours of pure online, everything was awesome, I thought that this is the perfect multiplayer game, they are constantly updating it and there is a lot of stuff - which has become the problem. A year and a half ago, everything was more or less balanced, the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me:

"Hey buddy, want to enjoy the content? Well, you should get our brand new garage only for 2M."

Then Gunrunning. Again, my overall feelings:

"Look at this cool update! The players will be able to get their bunkers only for 1.5M. Also, don't forget to upgrade your equipment for another 1M. Did we forget to mention that getting additional people working for you will only cost you half a million? By the way, you will time from time get raided and lose everything, unless you buy another cameras for 400K! All the raids will magically disappear! Want to modify your weapons in your Workshop? Well, too bad, you need a trailer for that, but don't worry, it's only 1 to 2 and a half millions. Do you want to train your shooting? There you go, only for 700K! Do you prefer white over black? The paint costs 105K, so... Did we mention that you can take a nap there? The key for that room costs 265K. Do you want a Gun Locker which you will probably never use? That will be 175K. You want some caddies? 85K or 120K if you want to have them larger. Don't forget to check out the new cars! Get yourself a car that shoots a couple of missiles only for 4-5M!"

How I felt about Smuggler's Run:

Hello there! This update will be about planes. Want a hangar? 1 to 5M. Which style would you prefer? The one for 100k or the one for 320k? Want different lights? No problem - the more expensive style you chose the more expensive lights you'll get! Isn't that cool? Want some nice 'art' on the floor? Sure, we'll paint it for you, costs only up to 200k, just like your apartment you bought last year to do heists! Furniture? You mean another wall? That's another 280k for you. Again, want the keys to access your bed? 235k-375k. You want to customize your 500k glider? One word - WORKSHOP! And guess what this number, 1,150,000 means... Correct! It's the price!"

The prices of the content added were skyrocketing, if you wanted to truly enjoy the game, you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack, which is by the way, another big problem with this game, or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long, I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards, so I stopped playing. Since then, I've been ignoring the game, not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes, when I notice that there's an update, I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update, you might think this:

"Oh, finally another heist, things are getting back to the state when you could buy a house for 200k and get full content."

The reality, however, looks like this:

"Hey, it's nice to see you back in the game, look at this brand new heist room only for 2 millions, the same idea, only way more expensive."

And as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore, I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers. I finally am thrown into a lobby after 10 minutes of loading, I see that I am immediately teleported to an airport from my house with a couple of other people and I am stuck doing some rather strange animations. I always report the guy when I find out who it is, but it doesn't seem to help. I've heard some heartbreaking stories of people getting banned for no reason, this luckily hasn't happened to me yet.

OpenIV fiasco aside...modding aside... cause we all know you guys f***ed up with that..

But, what really bothers me and alot of people is the unrealistic and downright criminal prices you expect people to pay for your Shark Cards. $100 real money for $8Million in-game cash.

When every new DLC costs $25Million-$40Million if you want all the vehicles, upgrades, unlocks..etc..etc WTF good is $8Million?? Your price structure on everything from Shark Cards to Merch is bizarre and unbalanced - if you wonder why people mod and manipulate your game, its because nobody enjoys being blatantly ripped off.

Irony here, when the 'ripping off' got to much for you guys, you threatened the very same people that mod your game to enhance it and who, at the same time, put food on your table and keep you with a job.

STOP ripping off your customers and instead of fighting, why not listen to the community - expand the single player experience with some kind of worthwhile DLC, like people have been begging for. Why not make servers that welcome modders and people that enjoy enhancing the game and getting even more value for money.

and..for gods sake..STOP charging criminal-esqe, exorbitant prices for your poor value Shark Cards... ugh.. just STOP, we are all embarrassed for you over the shameful greed you've shown...and continue to show~

Online play broken

Like many others, I was banned from online play due to a faulty anticheat system that Rockstar has denied accountability for and has failed to repair, multiple months after its issues had first been brought to their attention.

Considering the major scope of this issue and its consequences, Rockstar's public response has been incredibly irresponsible and incompetent - auto-denying ban appeals and failing to formally address the cause of the issue.

Hopefully this issue will be erradicated in the near future, and we many who have been affected can again enjoy the online features of this fantastic product. I wish Rockstar the best in resolving these issues.

Rockstar can ban suspend/ban your account and completely reset your stats without any warning even when you have no used any mods, picked up modded cash or downloaded a cheat. Rockstar support will not revert your suspension/ban and refuse to look into your case when you ask them to over live support, only giving the same copy/pasted responses of "all decisions are final and your ban/suspension will not be reverted." They will refuse to check whether you are a legitimate player or not and if you are wrongfully banned, say goodbye to all the work you put into your character.

Meanwhile actual cheaters have a free reign in public lobbies, able to spawn in unlimited cash, unreleased vehicles, invincibility, the ability to kill anyone not in passive mode instantly. None of them get banned, while thousands of legitimate players do.

Consider this a warning before buying.

**EDIT - Apparently I'm one of the hundreds thousand or so people falsely banned. People were getting banned in the tutorial. Seriously?**

This could be a good game if Rockstar wasn't the most incompetent ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.

You read a ton of these negative reviews thinking that these people are just unlucky, that it can't happen to you. I've been playing the game nonstop for a past week, making money for a bunker and new cars and in the middle of a game, I just got falsely banned for a month for no reason at all and my character and progress INSTANTLY reset.

It's a shame because this is a blast to play with friends, but Rockstar just can't seem to manage ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with their own game. They don't try to improve the experience, pushing out a bunch of events that no one seems to care about, releasing new content that require days of grinding and instead forcing everyone to buy their absurd shark cards, which people still apparently get banned for.

Another thing which I found cute is that now their support page reminds you over and over no bans, no matter what, may be appealed and are AUTOMATICALLY closed. So even when they ban people fo no reason: tough luck.

Not to mention, do you know what I'll find when I log on a month later, all of my hard work reset back to nothing? Modders and cheaters, the same that have been on the game ever since it first came to PC.

This game will forever be garbage because of Rockstar. This review will stay if mine and countless others bans are not overturned.

**EDIT 03/29/18 - A majority of the falsely banned players, myself included, have been unbanned with all of our accounts intact.. to promptly being banned once again with the same response Rockstar had in the beginning of this mess. So good job Rockstar.**

600 hours. Great game. Came back on to have some fun with an old friend and to check out the new updates. We did some CEO missions and drove around, deciding not to bother the other players and do our own thing. I log off the game. Five minutes later i receive an email stating i have violated the EULA and my account, character, and inventory have all been reset. Years of work. Gone. I decided to give the game another chance after the same scenario had happened to my best friend before the reset was a thing, just to have it happen to me. Don't get me wrong, we had a blast driving around, grinding up enough money to finally buy the vehicles and homes we wanted, then proceed to try the new modes as they came out like the racing, CEO, adversary modes. I saw all these negative reviews on the page stating how people had been randomly banned, and when they brought this up on the forums, they were called "liars" and told "Dont cheat again ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•". I thought they were full of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• until it happened to me. I have no chance of getting all i've worked for back unless i buy their damn shark cards, and even then, whos to say they wont ban me again? I can say the uninstall button worked better than the anti-cheat, as ive seen countless modders roaming around unopposed, causing hell to other players. Im 90% sure that the majority of answers im going to get for this review are going to be the "regulars" who claim everyone hacks or cheats except them, and that i won't be missed. Thats fine. Just note Rockstar, if you by chance read my lovely review, you've lost another customer. I will never buy from you again. It was fun while it lasted but in the end, even i was beaten by a robot with the banhammer, with no reason, or ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• given.

Things I Have Never Done in GTA Online:
Used Hacks in Any Form
Modded the Game (Single or Multiplayer)
Been Given Hacked Money
Asked for Hacked Money
Glitched or Used Exploits
Cheated or Abused the Game
Had any Software Installed that has been known to Interfere with Cheat Detection

Things I Have Done:
Paid for GTAV on two platforms
Spent over 350hours playing GTAOnline across two platforms
Rarely spent any time in Public GTAOnline Sessions
Bought all Previous Rockstar Games and Loved them

So in early December 2016 I was grinding hard in GTAOnline during a slow week. I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-specific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month.

At first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final.

I have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up.

At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed.

Let me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it.

Overall:
So: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why.

GTA V Story:

The story is absolutly nice with 3 Characters, different views of every single person and random missions.
It would be also great, when Rockstar Games would release here in the story mode some more updates.





GTA V Online:

It was an nice game, but update for update you getting more broke because you cant get easy money in the online mode.
So basicly you cant use the updates that hard because you cant buy anything, you must need to play missions for weeks to buy 1-2 items. It isnt the same like in the past versions.

I cannot recommend any game that attacks and spits on it's community like Take-Two has with this recent assault on mods. Rockstar had previously given a blanket approval to mod single player content into the game, but Take Two throws that out the window with the cease and desist letter it sent.

This is a clear cash grab that comes days after the CEO of Take Two stated that the company is under monitizing the GTA playerbase. The company doesn't think your $60 purchase of their game is enough, so they want to force you into the horrendously grindy GTA Online so you will give in and buy Shark Cards, because you cannot experience the Online portion of the game without millions of dollars, and with the rate at which they trickle money to you, you are encouraged to part with more of your hard earned money to play the game that you already spent $60 buying.

Until the last update, I would have highly recommended this game, but sadly I would advise everyone to steer away from this game and any other future Take-Two/Rockstar game. I think theifs is the best way to describe these companies. I can confirm to those of you reading these reviews saying "surely they wouldn't be removing in game funds that people pay $80/¬£60+ for?" that it is really happening. I will split this review into two parts; Single Player and Multiplayer.

Singleplayer
The story and how it plays out for single player is possibly the best out there. The story is fantasic, and there are very few missions that aren't fun to play. Also, the implementation of an in-game stock market (although not the best thing ever) is really cool to me. Pairing this with missions that allow you to manipulate this stock market, you can earn millions, even billions. But this leads to the issue of there being nothing to spend it on. Singleplayer mode for some reason does not get content from Rockstar's updates. The only way you can access them is by grinding multiplayer for days to afford the likes of one car, however we will get to that.
Overall, Singleplayer is absolutely fantastic, except from the fact that after the story there is little to do unless you are interested in mods, in which case you will probably love this game for that.

Multiplayer

Oh yay, this train wreck. Okay, so I have 1,151 hours on Steam for GTA V, with around 1,000 being for multiplayer. I converted my stats from PS3 so likely have around double that. I know what I am talking about with this game. The multiplayer in this game is absolutely trash now. I was always able to look past the grind in this game, but it has gotten to the point now where money is so hard to make, and things are so expensive that it is no longer fun. At all. Rockstar and Take-Two have become money ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, so much so that they are taking purchased in-funds away for NO REASON and will accuse you of hacking the game. If you refuse to purchase the in-game currency (like me), then you will have to grind. Now, at least in my ways, around 1 hour of in game grinding will bring in, at most, around $300,000, and that's if youre grinding really hard, non stop, and have the most lucrative in game businesses in the game. When starting out, you will be lucky to bring in $100,000 per hour, so as you can see, it's a pretty tough grind anyway. The last update called "Smuggler's Run" brought some of the most expensive content in GTA Online to date, with things costing $1,500,000 upwards. I had 2.6 million removed from an in-game challenge called Criminal Mastermind that took me months to complete, getting $10,000,000 from. This was removed because it was "modded or cheated money". So, 6 tickets to Rockstar later, I have quite rudely been told by a robot to go ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• myself and that I'm not getting it back, and that's why I've finally decided that enough is enough with this game.
Something that I have always found interesting in GTA Online is that you can buy a yacht - a real calling card, with the most expensive one sitting at $10,000,000. The highest in-game currency you can purchase is $8,000,000, sitting at $100 real money. That to me has always seemed ridiculous for what is already a fairly expensive game.
Also, if you want to mod singleplayer, thats fine in their eyes (not really since they shut down OpenIV, a company they supported but hey let's let bygones be bygones), but if you DARE go near their money making method and try to make things fun, you will be banned and stripped of everything you have online.

Overall
This review could go on forever, about a game/company that steals from their fans and shuts down companies who they once directed their fans to, but I think it's time to sum it up. For what was for a very long time my favourite game ever, I would highly recommend that you never go near this game, even if you recieve it for free. I will never touch another Rockstar or Take-Two game, and hope that their next game flops and they learn no treat their fans better, however, if you're not giving them money, they hope you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• yourself.

Update: Went on today to see if I had been refunded yet, and guess what!! I haven't.

Update 2: Left another ticket to Rockstar asking HOW my money was illegitamate, stating several times that I know that it, according to them, is illegitimate but after my ticket making it to support stage 3 (presumably the highest? Has been in all support companies I know.), guess what happened? I got the same copied and pasted ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• response AGAIN. This reponse took them over a week to type.

Actively shutting down 100% legal singleplayer modding tools after refusing to develop pretty much anything for singleplayer post-launch should not be encouraged.

When I bought this game on Jul 6, 2015, and played it for the first time it seemed amazing. There weren't that many cheaters around, Rockstar weren't pushing their shark cards so hard yet. The amount of money needed to get something was considerate. Like top apartments were $200'000, cars cost hardly over $500'000 and you could easily get your first million simply by playing each heist just one time.

Then bikers came out introducing new ways of making money with biker businesses. Which were then greately nerfed after a while. Rockstar began to push their shark cards harder and began to fight the competition they themselves made. That was the first time I noticed Rockstar being greedy and cutting players' income to make it harder for them to grind the money in game making them feel like they need to invest real $$ to get some in-game $$.

After that CEO import\export with crates and stolen vehicles came out which, again, at first allowed players to earn some nice money pretty fast. And guess what happened next? Rockstar nerfed the income yet again making it hardly profitable for the players. And at the same time the prices kept growing wild. Like some cars costing over $2'000'000, apartments costing over 1 milion providing no extra features. Hardly useful mobile operation centers costing 1.5-2 million. And shark cards popping up everywhere like a real annoying advertisement in real life.

Then in June 2017 Gunrunning came out which was a blast in moneymaking compared to any previous activities and remained the best way to make money in GTA Online for a while. At last I was able to keep up with crazy prices on cars, bikes, guns, and all sorts of customization in game (still taking up insane amount of time to grind though, but at least "the price was right")
That remained the case up untill late february \ early march of 2018, when I noticed my sales shrank in half. And this time, since it happened recently, I am able to state some real numbers:
For a year I was able to pay $75'000 to get a full stock of supplies for my bunker. Which then produced me an amout of guns worth of $420'000 per one sale using a single vehicle. Meaning I had a net profit of $345'000 per one single sale playing solo. And as of today the numbers shrank down to just $210'000 per sale, but I still have to pay the same $75'000 for the supplies and wait for the same amount of time for these weapons to manufacture which makes my net profit $135'000 (down from $345'000). That's $210'000 less than it used to be PER ONE SALE.
The exact same thing happened to EVERY DLC activities earlier. I just can't memorize the exact diffirence in numbers for those older changes, but the effect was the same every time. I stopped doing these older missions since they became hardly profitable. And this time the gunrunning is gonna be my next abandoned facility :(

Now let's move on to another huge problem of this game: CHEATERS.
Rockstar made only one good attempt in fighting modders for real. JUST ONCE. When they decided to completely prohibit the use of any modification for GTA Online, which then resulted in a huge outbreak of negative reviews on Steam which spooked Rockstar to the bone. And they quickly reverted these changes completely removing such protection within a couple days. Allowing r–µt–∞rd–µd individuals to keep on griefing on other players using mods.
And nothing has changed ever since.

This is why I AM NOT GOING TO BUY and DO NOT RECOMEND you to buy ANY GAMES FROM ROCKSTAR in the future.
Rockstar used to be a great company making masterpiece games. But they became corrupted by these filthy greedy marketologists, and began to penalize their loyal and honest players with income cuts, crazy in-game prices and long grind times while allowing cheaters and modders to thrive on, completely ruining GTA Online.

ROCKSTAR, STOP BEING GREEDY AND MAKE YOUR GAME GREAT AGAIN!

It's 2015 Summer, window is wide open, you have your headphones on, it's 2 AM everybody is asleep. But you just got your hands on GTA V that you have waited for so long for. You just finished another mission with Micheal and got dropped of near Sandy Shores. Next mission marker is in the main city you get a car , hit enter, start driving, scroll to Non Stop Pop FM and hear "Modjo - Lady (Hear me Tonight). Wind breezes through your open window and you feel as you are on a real highway, blasting that jam on full sound and pressing W to the max.

At that moment you had no worries in world and were just having fun, little did you know that you were making memories...

- Played over 900 hours.
- Never got banned.
- Never received money from any hacker.
- Never had any similar problem with Rockstar.
Why is it a thumbs down?
- Multiplayer it's still infested with hackers, modders, people begging for money, kids cursing for no reason etc.
- You will get banned? 50% sure.
- Will it be your fault? 100% not.
- The hackers are giving you money just because they can, and they want to, not because you will ask them to.
- How do you stay away from hackers? Maybe you're asking..well, you create empty sessions, but that's not how a multiplayer experience should work on a triple A title.
- If you don't have friends, don't bother buying it, unless you wanna play singleplayer.
- Oh..one more important thing, Rockstar is even trying to solve the methods of creating empty sessions, they already patched some of them, so you gonna be forced to stay on sessions full of people i mentioned above, but don't worry..your boy got your back, here's the last single method i know that works if you want to create an empty session:
- Alt+Ctrl+Delete>Task Manager>Performance>Open Resource Monitor>Right Click on Grand Theft Auto app>Suspend Process (for 10 seconds)>Resume Process, and you get your own empty session, you're welcome.

After 3+ years of playing GTA V on both PS4 and PC, and putting in hundreds of hours into the game, Rockstar unfairly banned my account and reset all of my character progress. I had to grind and grind to make money because Rockstar wants players to buy their vastly overpriced Shark Cards, and I, along with other people with high cash balances, was unjustly banned and lost it all.

Support tickets I submitted were ignored and met with the same copy-and-paste responses repeating their ban policy. After this ordeal I am never going to buy another Rockstar-affiliated product. They don't care about their players or customers. They only want to make money.

You have a 50/50 chance of what kind of multiplayer lobby you get into.
1) A lobby where modders try to stop you from leaving your apartment and drop money for themselves with people begging them to give them money

2) A lobby with a bored dude who decides to ruin other people's days

How to avoid this? Task Manager > Resource Manager > GTA V > Suspend Process for 15 seconds > GTA V > Resume process. Enjoy the solo public lobby.

Another way to avoid this? Play the focused-on-details, great story mode on GTA V.

Michael - Typical high-class old guy with anger issues

Franklin - A guy trying to gain some clout through the most inefficient methods possible

Trevor - Michael in a nutshell minus the high-class part and worse anger issues.

GTA Online character - Guy who gets spammed with calls by Paige Harris, and some other guys persuading him/her to buy some foreclosure.

Overall the game has been ruined by Rockstar and TakeTwo's greed. Online is entirely built around making the game so painfully unplayable as to encourage Shark Card sales. Every mission has excessively drawn-out drives and time wasting objectives, the mechanics are being tweaked slowly to make the game harder and harder to play without just buying your money. Grinding the game is an NDA away from being a full time job, Rockstar expects you to spend 60hrs a week on this game. Not to mention the community, the GTA Online community is by far the saddest, most pathetic, cringeworthy, group of degenerates you can find on the internet. The cheating is also a big problem, Rockstar will ban you, but only if you illegitimately acquire money. They'll only punish what threatens their Shark Card sales. The cheaters, or "modders" as they call themselves, due to Rockstar's lazy networking and lack of dedicated servers, can remind you of why you gave up on the game years ago in a instant. The game is P2P, in 2021, P2P... you can see the issue. If it were 2015, I'd say give it a try. However as of now, this game is a shell of what it was, let it die.

Also, on a very personal note, genuinely, from the true bottom of my heart, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you Rockstar. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. You.

TLDR; The game is fun but Rockstar and Take-Two provide no specific information regarding suspension or bans. Even if bans are final, this information should be provided to the user so they can rectify the issue. To make it clear, my current temporary suspension is a false-positive to my knowledge. I requested further information regarding the EULA violation from their support team. They chose not to provide infomration on the EULA violation, nor did they provide evidence that my account had violated the EULA. I can not recommend this game because they do not make this information accessible.

-----------------------------------------------

Until this week I would have recommended GTA V as a great game. It has an enjoyable single player and while the multiplayer is a grind to say the least, Rockstar have made it possible to perform the activities / missions / events with more than four players, which is a common pitfall of most co-operative games. This has given the game replay value, which led to the large number of hours I have played it. Whenever my friends and I needed a game we all were happy to play, GTA V was commonly the choice. I will acknowledge that GTA V itself is a great game to play with friends, and alone. However, on Monday - whilst mid-mission, GTA V's anti-cheat engine handed me out a temporary suspension. Like a broken record, I will say that I do not cheat, exploit, or mod the game, nor do I have any program which is capable of tampering with the games code or memory.

At the time, I summised that GTA V's cheat engine works using a heurisitc system which looks at the behaviour of programs running in the background. Most likely it looks for programs attempting to inject code, control window handles, or view memory. I am relatively sure that it was my AS Rock tuning utility - which was monitoring sensory data, that is the culprit. I deduced this only from the fact that it was the only program that I had not run while running GTA V over a long period of time. However, I can also deduce that this program would have in no way altered or hindered the GTA V executable, nor its online service. I do not simply want to serve the 30 day suspension (which I am quite happy to do - understand that an anti-cheat engine that analyzes behaviour is bound to misinterpret occasionally) and then find that I am permanently banned. The problem with this game isn't the anti-cheat engine itself. In software engineering of this nature, there is always a tradeoff between false positives and limiting the number of cheats. So many hackers were ruining the game that the developers had make the anti-cheat engine more aggressive - result: more false positives.

The problem lies in their lack of support and the ignorance that they hold towards this potential tradeoff. I sent a message to support - not asking to appeal the ban (explicitly telling them that I did not wish to appeal), but rather asking for information regarding the violation so that I could determine what caused the issue. The support message was viewed three times according to their "latest activity" timer over two days, and then "Charles" provided an automated message essentially copy and pasting the same content on their website regarding the issue. This is the problem. Rockstar and Take-Two's line is that "everyone is banned" for a reason - and therefore bans are final. If they enforce this, then they should inform the user of the specific violation that occurred. Providing me with an automated message provides me with no information doesn't tell me what set it off your anti-cheat engine. More so, it is an insult to your player base to not provide this information.

Furthermore, there is an issue regarding permanently banning accounts without providing proof of the offense. In particular, in the termination section they state that they will only terminate an accounts service if it violates the code of conduct or if the service itself is terminated by the licensor (i.e. they stop online support for the game). By permanently banning someone (i.e. terminating online services to that registered account), this directly implies that the user must have violated the code of conduct. If they don't provide proof of the infraction, then one should question whether there was even a violation of their services. The burden of proof is on Take-Two or Rockstar to prove that you violated the EULA. If they can't provide the evidence, then there is no proof of a license violation and therefore they are breaking their own EULA. Since the EULA is essentially a contract, they are legally liable in this scenario.

If the game provided proof of the violation that the registered account made against the EULA, then I would recommend this game - because then the game/service/or support would explicitly state the violation to the user and give the user a chance to seek remedy in the scenario that the grounds for the violation were false. As it is, Rockstar, Take-Two, nor their support channels make no attempt to provide this information. Furthermore, the support channels they provide for EULA violations (i.e. bans) provides no further assistance in the issue - why have it at all? Just tell us that you don't answer questions on bans rather than wasting our time. So as it stands, I will not be utilising their online services until they do provide this information. Hence, I do not recommend this game because at this time, I can not fully utilise the product without risk of the Licensor (Take-Two) violating the conditions of their EULA in the termination section (i.e. permanently banning me) and with no possiblity of the Licensee (Me) seeking appeal or remedy.

Steam you need to fix this! You should not allow a developer to control access to offline/single player content customers paid for because Rockstar can't get their act together. Players can't play story/offline mode because Social Club Services are unavailable.

Got banned after not logging in to GTA Online for almost a year. After logging in today, played for less than an hour and suddenly got banned. No reason nothing and even my account got reset. 450+ hours spend on Online on PC, all gone to waste. No respond from Rockstar neither will they look into it. I never cheated on this game not even once and now i am being betrayed

Grand Theft Auto V

I have never thought that I will write a negative review on game like GTA V. For a long time it was one of my favorite games, but after last ban wave I reconsidered my opinion, and I just can not recommend this game to anyone who is considering to buy it for multiplayer or is already playing.

If you still do not have this game, and you just want to play singleplayer, do not hesistate and go for it. Singleplayer alone is worth those money.

Now about multiplayer:
grind here is bad
it has lot of bugs
so many endless loadings
you need friends to really enjoy the game, and even with them it will be frustrating experience
there are not many things which you could do alone
you can not do your businesses on your own private server, so you are forced to play with random players, because of that it is really frustrating and hard to make any money
new updates are worse and worse, they cost a lot of money, and in the end most of those things are totally useless
they do not care about old stuff which is already in the game, for example: Titan could have functional loading bay or Cargobob could have magnet rather than that useless hook...
BAN WAVES which causes suspensions even for legit players
Yet there are still many modders
Still after all those things THE BIGGEST PROBLEM is R* Support, I can say that I have never seen worse support. It is like talking with robots, they are using scripted phrases, and in the end they will not help you.

As a player who got banned without any reason, I was trying to get some answers. At least I wanted to know "what have I done?". But they will not tell you, because you do not have permission to know that. The only thing you get is their typical copy/paste answer how their anticheat is flawless, and you are the one who broke EULA rules, but which one? Who knows...

Another thing is that with the ban they also delete your characters, because of that I lost my 700h+ progress.

So if you are guilty, you can prepare yourself that after the ban ends, you probably get another one (permanent), because you can not prevent happening it again without knowing what it caused.

And if you are really innocent, the only thing what you can do is wait...

After all of this I was just waitting for some statement from Rockstar and you know what?

Even though thousands of players were banned falsely, after month Rockstar did not do any statement, they just act like nothing ever happend.

This is how Rockstar appreciate their costumers.

In-Depth Analysis

Story
GTA 5 is an intelligent, chucklesome & relevant depiction of modern America. The attention to detail that goes into making its world feel alive & believable is what makes it interesting & enjoyable.

The plot works at the edges of believability, with its intense action that will remind you of action movies: riding bikes along trains, fighting the military & robbing banks. Its 3 main characters are what keeps it engaging even at its most extreme moments.

Michael is a retired bank robber with a good-for-nothing son, foolish daughter & cheating wife. Franklin is a young man from the hood who is shown as the gang-banger stereotype even as he‚Äôs unwillingly seduced by the idea of a bigger payout. Trevor is a criminal psychopath whose redneck rampage is fuelled by drugs, alcohol & a messed-up childhood. The well-written & acted interaction between them & the development with one another gave the narrative its power.

GTA 5 offers an interesting & enjoyable story that takes about 32 hours to complete. It is delivered extremely well with nicely implemented cutscenes, dialogue & well-developed characters.

Gameplay
The open-world state of Blaine County & Los Santos is 81 km2. It offers a wide range of activities in the city, wilderness, mountains & desert ranging from parachuting, racing, heisting & much more.

Each character has a unique special ability: Franklin‚Äôs slow-motion driving, Michael‚Äôs slow-motion shooting & Trevor‚Äôs invincibility. They all have stats that can be improved for better combat, driving or flying experience.

An immense amount of weapons present: from SMGs, rifles, pistols & explosives. Each weapon supports a range of attachments: scopes, suppressors, magazines, etc... All these weapons can be used via the simple weapon wheel & create an enjoyable combat experience.

For the first time in the series, a first-person mode. This offers a completely different way to play the game. It is extremely well done & isn‚Äôt just sticking the camera inside the player‚Äôs head: all animations, recoil & accuracy are different for the first-person view to make for the most enjoyable FPS GTA experience possible.

There is a wide range of activities to be done after completing the story to get 100%: collectables, side missions, easter eggs, strangers & freaks that take hours to complete & add to the value of the game. There are plenty of buildings you can enter & areas to explore from strip-clubs to crashed planes at the bottom of the ocean floor among others.

Online
Online still offers a very fun experience even after completing the story mode, especially with a group of friends where you can spend hours upon hours in free-roam alone. There are plenty of activities: CEO, Nightclub & Clubhouse free-roam missions & a wide range of contact missions, races, deathmatches & heists that are available to do at any moment. All online lobbies are usually full of players depending on the time of day.

Online features some RPG elements such as levels & money which can be used for unlocking & purchasing new businesses, weapons, clothes & vehicles.

Rockstar ruined the online experience in the majority of public lobbies by adding overpriced & overpowered vehicles such as a flying motorbike able to shoot homing missiles that can‚Äôt be shot down because of infinite countermeasures. This added an immense amount of toxicity to the game with tryhards & people that constantly kill you because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù. This makes public lobbies an extremely unenjoyable experience. Rockstar forces you to play in these lobbies if you plan on carrying out any money-making activities.

The game lacks a reputable anti-cheat & cheaters are constantly present in almost every public lobby. Sometimes these cheaters are generous & drop you money while other times they destroy your experience by locking you inside a cage or constantly setting you on fire. Rockstar manages to ban innocent players more often than they ban cheaters which is totally unacceptable.

Pricing & Content
GTA V & the GTA Online Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack can be purchased for $35 which is an absolute steal in my opinion, especially for the number of hours of entertainment this game will provide just in single-player, plus the starter pack gives you a nice bonus to start within Online.

Almost everything in Online is locked behind an overpriced price tag that requires you to either grind for hours or give in to the microtransactions called ‚ÄúShark cards‚Äù that give you a very small amount of in-game currency.

Online receives ‚Äúfree‚Äù content updates every few months that include new missions, heists, vehicles & weapons. By ‚Äúfree‚Äù I mean, the actual update is free but all the items inside it require an intense grind or shark cards. The single-player portion of the game has been completely abandoned since launch & has received no new content.

Technical Analysis

Performance
The game runs flawlessly on a decent hardware setup. I've had absolutely zero problems maintaining a constant 60FPS on ‚ÄúVery High‚Äù settings with an i7-6700K, 16GB RAM & a GTX 1060 6G. Online does have slightly worse performance unfortunately but it‚Äôs understandable because of the 32 player count on a game of this calibre.

Graphics
The impressive level of detail in the vast open world of Los Santos & Blaine County has come with zero compromises in terms of graphical slowdown. There is some graphical pop-in, but it‚Äôs minor compared to other games, even more recent ones. The entire first-person mode has a completely different set of animations for everything your character does which is an appreciable amount of effort.

Audio, Voice Acting & Soundtrack
The game‚Äôs audio is rich in detail from footsteps, individual vehicle sounds to the ambient background sounds of the city & countryside.

Hundreds of hours of dialogue were professionally written & recorded for the three main characters & NPCs. The amount of effort put into the voice acting for this game to make it as realistic as possible is astounding. They went as far out as hiring real gang members including one who got out of prison the day before recording.

The amazing original soundtrack is composed by The Alchemist, Oh No & Tangerine Dream in collaboration with Woody Jackson. The game features 20 in-game radio stations, featuring multiple genres of songs by famous artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Dr Dre & Phil Collins.

AI
The AI is interactive & intelligent but the enemies, specifically police are extremely annoying because they always know where you are making it almost impossible to escape from their line of sight at times. They also have broken aim where you can lose nearly all your health instantly & have no chance to retaliate.

Bugs & Issues
There are slight sky flickering issues when driving & gaining/losing altitude extremely fast. Unfortunately, the servers for Online aren‚Äôt great & you suffer infinite loading screens & disconnection issues constantly.

Conclusion
GTA 5 is an enjoyable & addicting addition to the franchise with an interesting & enjoyable story, refreshing new gameplay & immense attention to detail. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.

I made the mistake of purchasing this game for PC. I waited, and was excited. I took the numerous delays that this port experienced with stride. Upon playing this game for an amount of time that has left me disgusted and embarrased, I can really only say one thing to summarize: the hacking is terrible, and the game grinding is worse.

Every so often, I return to this game asking myself "Why did I stop playing again?" The answer comes in less than 10 minutes of playing in a public lobby, when a hacker will do any of the following: teleport me over the ocean, blow me up, blow my vehicle up but make it seem as though I blew it up (so you have to pay a premium to get it back), kill me from across the map, teleport me the the ceiling for a free fall with no parachute, take money from my in game account, spam blow me up in a constant cycle of death, sticking a firepit onto my character so that he will burn to death constantly (the firepit never goes away unless you restart the game itself), or simply crash my game entirely.

Oh wait, my GOSH, they did address the hacking. No more OpenIV Liberty City for GTA V. Those dastardly spawns of Satan within OpenIV are surely more of a threat than actual in-game hackers that have ruined countless gaming experiences, right? Wait a minute here....something seems a little fishy...

Perhaps Rockstar, or TakeTwo for that matter, likes in-game hackers more than OpenIV for one simple reason: OpenIV stands to cut into possible revenue for TakeTwo (why play Online where there is money to be made by Rockstar when I can play in a Liberty City mod for freeeee); while hackers take players' money, which opens up the potential for more time spent in-game to earn the money back, or the possible purchase of a Shark Card. Seems simple enough for me.

On to the other bone I have to pick (oh Rockstar, why have you left so many for me to chew on?): in-game prices. "Free DLC" is a blantant lie. It's free if you have no life in order to play the game constantly for the medicore payouts that you get for completing "high paying, high risk work" that is required to pay for all of this "free content". However, if you have other priorities in life that exceed making bank as a major criminal in this world of photons and hacking, then your best bet of experiencing any kind of new content is to look up the myriad of videos that are posted by the deplorable YouTubers of the GTA community (you know the ones), and you will surely have your fill of this content. Or you can ask one of the numerous hackers in this game to simply spawn you some of the new content. Have I mentioned that there are hackers galore in this game, by the way?

Honestly though, just look at the prices for Shark Cards, and then look at the prices for in game content. Your question as to why a flying bike that shoots homing missile was added, has been dutifully answered.

This game has left me beyond disappointed in the end, and quite the sour taste in my mouth. My disgusting amount of hours in-game speak for themselves: I enjoyed it at one point, but the constant grinding for a game with little reward, hardly any payout for in-game work, the exorbitant prices for any new content, and the experience ruining hacking has left me with little desire to ever play the game again. And, I surely don't plan on it. You, oh reader of my woe, might be able to still save yourself.

The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre-ordering games, but I made one exception this year for GTA, and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre-order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) , I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch, because the game is ridiculously big.

I'm running it at 60-90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on "high", except for the advanced options, which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680, which is a few years old now, so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA, because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.

You can play GTA in first or third person mode, and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person, but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting, swimming, walking can also be done in first person, so you can just pick what you like the best.

If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA, because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online, because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.

Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world, but also in certain quests. Michael, Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character, Niko.

GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single-player experience, but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run, but to play free-roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12, so that might refresh things even more.

I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it, at least for the driving. You can enable auto-aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard, or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat, and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates, which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.

I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit "Z" to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard, mouse, and controller so thats really good, but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.

GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online, much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed, so I will just see GTA online as a plus.

Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort, time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends, whether your the single or multiplayer guy, you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year.

I've been playing this game since it was on the 360 and have enjoyed the content for the most part, aside from the horribly toxic community killing anything that moves, modders ruining every aspect possible, trolls making missions and heists unbearable and so on. I would enjoy this game more if you could do Motor Cycle Club, CEO work, and the other money making portions in private or solo lobbies. Despite all my issues with this game, the long loading times, all of it, I did find it enjoyable with friends.

And then it happened.

I got hit with a random perma ban for simply playing the game. I honestly don't know what else it could have been aside from a false flag from the ban bot or users not knowing that the MK II Heavy Sniper can have explosive rounds... Maybe players should just leave players alone unless they want a fight? If you wanna fight, don't cry when you get killed, especially since I never liked the PvP in this game, I honestly avoided players at all times cause I got tired of trying to figure out which one was a modder or not.

So, until my ban gets lifted and Rockstar can figure out that we should be able to fight to get to play this game, I'm leaving this as a negative review and a warning for anyone who wants to play this to play this game, do so at your own risk. Cause that damn bot will not give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• when it bans you and Rockstar will do nothing to change it.


Edit: Since this review has been gaining some traction, I feel I may want to clear some stuff up, especially now that I'm less frustrated at the joke that is Rockstar support.

Honestly, I despise cheaters and modders in games where the progression is the grind cause you sell yourself short of the satisfaction of having worked up to your goal and getting the thing you wanted and worked for. Not saying that the stupid prices for stuff in this game is fair, but it does feel satisfying to finally get something... Only to turn around and ask why the hell I needed this thing in the first place. Though I get it. Some people want the instant gratification that comes with mods and modded money, but for me, that would just help kill the game even more for cause then it begs the question, "Why bother playing this game in the first place?" You can get literally anything and everything you want at the push of a button and at no effort on your part other than a Google search. I don't like cheating and modding cause it feels dirty and wrong. Hell, I don't even really use mods in single player games till I've beaten the story to try and get the full experience of the game before going back and seeing what I missed, other options and choices if possible, or just seeing how badly I can break the game. But only in single player games where I'm not messing with other people's experiences, cause I'd honestly hate for someone to do the same to me in return.

That's just my stance on it, I know some people are gonna laugh and scoff at it, but I just thought I'd put this out there. Thanks for talking your time to read this, or at least skim over it.

TL;DR
Singleplayer is fun and enjoyable as long as the next update doesn't keep resetting your progress.

Online is a battlefield and everyone and their mother will try to kill you. Play at your own risk. Money is gonna be a constant grind to get cause of how overpriced the fun stuff is, but in lobbies, you're probably gonna get blown up no matter what you do. There's ways to make solo lobbies. Keep it close and ready at all times and play with groups of friends whenever possible.

GTA Online, the jack of all trades game which does everything quite well while staying a safe distance away from all forms of perfection. I currently have 4,617 hours of playtime logged in this game, most of it online or in the creator. Once this game made it out on PC, complete with a first person viewpoint, I felt as though my lifelong journey of discovering an entire world which I could live in and do whatever I desired was finally becoming a reality.

I loved this game. LOVED this game. I've been playing since the top-down days of GTA 1, always dreaming of the time when I could experience this crazy alternate world 'from my own eyes.'

However, having spent this much time in the game leaves me with one conclusion: I simply cannot recommend this game. Not to anyone, not for any reason. Not ever.

See, in a game which revolves around drugs, money, murder, and any manner of illegal activities, I kind of expect to be treated like a criminal inside of the game.

I do not expect to be treated like a crimial outside of the game by the sorry excuse they have for tech support.

On 08/29/17, well into week 3 of some amazing double payout bonuses and mere days away from the Smuggler's Run DLC, my few friends and I were spending many long hours playing away and racking up some serious money through all of our hard work. However, Rockstar decided that it was time to run another sweep looking for people who mod, glitch, cheat, hack, or exploit their game.

Apparently it found very few of these people. Instead, it found a whole bunch of us legitimate players. Then it decided to punish us all wholesale, never once telling us why or how it came to this conclusion. Better still, many of these people with modded money didn't get affected at all!

First we are met with a screen during the game's loading cycle stating 'we have determined that GTA$ and/or RP details on your account were adjusted by something out of your control and we have taken action to fix it. No additional action is required from you at this time.'

Now, a lot of people will try to argue that they are completely legit 'except for that one time when...' I am not one of these people. I know what the public sessions are like in this game. It's because of this that I had only ever played in closed or solo sessions until very recently, with the same one or two known and trusted friends, for most of my online time. I had never played online on a console and had never transferred an online character. I routinely took screenshots of my online bank account just in case some modder somehow managed to get through to me and mess with my hard-earned cash.

To this day I have yet to see a single glitched or modded GTA dollar go into my account. I would know if it went there. I do not place myself into situations where such a thing could happen and I keep a very close eye on what happens to my game. In addition I've never modded nor glitched GTA money, myself. I've never even duped a car. Honestly, I don't even know how to do any of this stuff!

Rockstar apparently could not care any less about this as they had decided to 'take action' and steal $28,553,333 of my legitimate, hard-earned money. Right out of the blue, no explanation given. 'Okay,' I think, 'their anti-cheat is confused with the double payouts we've gotten over these last few weeks. They'll figure it out, this'll get sorted out, everyone who had their legit cash removed will get it back.' There's quite a lot of us, too. Look around the forums and message boards. Tons of us. Including about ten people whom I've just stared playing with mere days ago, which happens to be most of the people that I know in this game.

Sadly, this does not appear to be the case. Rockstar's support number has a doofy automated thing saying to use their support website (which many of us have already attempted to use.) Any attempt to mention this stolen money on said website will soon see the issue being flagged as being a 'cheat/exploit or banning issue.' It may or may not also have an automated response from some soulless bot stating that "Your shared bank account in GTA Online was adjusted to remove illegitimately gained in-game money." Then the trouble ticket will be closed. End of story, slap across the face. 'You cheated, we corrected it, get lost.'

Like Hell! Not ONCE have I EVER done anything in this game to cheat. I HATE cheating. Had any modded money been dropped onto me I would have told them about it in a heartbeat. But Rockstar simply does not care about how legitimate we are. They are always in the right, we as players are always in the wrong. I'll probably never see that money back but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop sending them trouble tickets about it. I'm currently sitting at number four. They will keep hearing from me until they either fix their error or ban me.

Nowhere has there been any official word from them about this. No 'we recognize that there was an issue' or 'we are currently looking into the matter.' Nope, we're all dirty cheaters, go screw off somewhere else. As if it wasn't bad enough that they find any way they can to deplete our online bank accounts through normal play, now they're outright stealing it from a lot of us!

All of the other rampant bugs in this game, both new and old, I could come to overlook (and there are quite a few of them!) The increasingly forced public session play, the psychotic AI drivers, the ridiculous AI buffs, being called a '‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•' by the NPC's hundreds of times during play (Rockstar must have a fascination with this word combination,) the list goes on. I won't even get into the mess that is story mode.

This matter, however... Now that I know who I am dealing with I am done purchasing anything with Rockstar's name on it. Take 2 is in significant danger as well since their name is now associated with this title. This kind of treatment of their playerbase is beyond unacceptable. I can't even fathom how much of my time had been lost due to this, though if you consider that their most expensive Shark Card weighs in at $100 USD and gives you 8 million credits then they just stole nearly $357 USD from me because of this nonsense and there isn't anything in the world I can do about it. (Except for sending them a bunch of trouble tickets and writing a negative review on Steam. Power to the consumer, gorramit.)

I had worked my butt off in this game for every dollar which I had saved and spent. I played it smart, made intelligent purchases, played the game the way it was meant to be played and did everything that I could do to protect myself and my belongings. As it turns out someone did manage to mess up my account in the end, just not how I would have expected.

Grand Theft Auto receives two middle fingers way, way up. If you've managed to avoid purchasing this game so far, congratulations! Stay far, far away from it and its rampant toxicity. If you already have purchased this and happened to experience a similar situation then I strongly encourage you all to join me in avoiding any of their games from this point forward while continuing to contact them through any means possible until they fix their broken crap and give us back our hard-earned money.

Seriously, go sit on a cactus Rockstar.

I used to think that GTA Online was a good game, even taking into account the many aspects people dislike about GTA Online, I personally enjoyed my time with it for quite some time. However, with the current state of the GTA Online's "PC Experience", I cannot in good faith recommend GTA:O, least you want to put your computer's safety at risk. I am completely outraged at how Rockstar Games have basically taken their cash cow, and destroyed it entirely, not by poor updates (as many other players would likely attest to), but rather, the lack of any updates to where it matters, server security. GTA Online has become fairly outdated, and in 2022, it is nearly unplayable. Hacking is so rampant, it makes CS:GO look like the cleanest game ever made by comparison. Every online session you join is a risk that you take that at any moment, the experience could be ruined by a hacker, either blowing you up repeatedly, teleporting you to the edge of the map, surrounding you in a unbreakable cage, making themselves invincible in PvP, spawning in tanks in non-vehicle PvP modes, and/or completely filling the public chat with racial slurs. I'm not taking from other people's experiences, all of the above has happened to me personally, and there is nothing you can do about it but accept it, which I have done for the past 8 years. I took a break from the game from 2017 to 2021, and when I came back, not only did hacking/modding get even worse, but it has expanded to new lows. Literally every single online session that I have been in has had scammers spamming the text chat with links or discord invites to blatant scams designed to scam you for real money. Recently, the text chat spam apparently wasn't working well enough, so they have expanded to sending you the same scams through the in-game phone texting system as well. Hackers have posted my own IP address multiple times, once in text chat and once through the text messaging system. And get this, players which have acquired a "mod menu" can literally crash your game to desktop with the press of a button. I am not exaggerating when I say that this game has worse digital security and anti-cheat than public Minecraft servers, at least there the game sometimes kicks you for flying, GTA Online can't even do that (a flying bus once picked me up and left me in the Lago Zancudo swamp once, true story). I did not think that this game could get any worse, but today, I found out that rock bottom was not nearly as far down as we could go, as the modders have decided to "grab a pickaxe", so to speak, and lodge it into the skull of Rockstar's servers. Recently modders have realized that they can exploit Rockstar's Social Club system to send every player in the game invites to their own modded session, where they can literally break your game. If you accept one of the constant game invites from a "B-a-l-l-s-t-o-r-t-u-r-e" (without the -'s placed to circumvent Steam's censorship), or if you end up in one of their sessions by chance (which is now very likely since they're also kicking players from other sessions), it will force your game into a spectator mode which you cannot leave from, or give you an error message, preventing you from playing the game outright, even if you quit and restart the game. GTA Online is now literally unplayable, and to say that this complete absence of online security from Rockstar is unacceptable would be the biggest understatement of the decade. The fact that Rockstar could allow their cash cow game to reach such a state is not only reprehensible, but outright despicable. There are no words in the English dictionary that could sufficiently describe my absolute repulsion at what could only be described as the most criminal act of negligent programming in the history of video games. The only way I can explain as to why Rockstar has let the situation grown so out of control is that they have grown so rich from shark card microtransaction money, that they have literally forgotten how to program anything more complex than a "hello world" program, it would certainly explain why the GTA trilogy remaster was such a disaster, and why it has taken them 9 year to even start making GTA 6. It is clear to me that Rockstar is nothing more than an example of the worst excesses of corporate greed, and while I certainly don't believe in the concept of "voting with your wallet", Rockstar Games will never see another cent out of me again, and I strongly urge you to stop playing GTA Online until the game has been cleaned out of hackers and modders, which considering Rockstar performance so far, will likely never happen.

TL;DR - GTA Online is now literally unplayable, due to hackers and modders, and even if it becomes playable again, avoid it like the plague, unless you want your IP address sold off to the highest bidder.

Let me start at the beginning in order to accurately describe this atrocity that has happened to me a few months ago. Just now decided to write a review after seeing the same thing has happened to so many others.

I bought GTAV on September 17th, 2013. I waited in the pre-order line at gamestop because I was so damn hyped for this game. I was only intending to play it on console until the PC version came out. At this point I had no clue that there was going to be character swaps from console to PC. I obtain level 72 on console. Loving the game, couldn't be happier (except if the radio stations were better).

PC version release date is announced sometime in January 2015. I immediately pre-order it in order to get the bonus money that was available as a pre-order incentive. Upon release I transfer my character from console to PC and recieve my pre-order money. I was so thrilled to finally be playing this great game on PC. In the last year I put in 390 hours online in this game and achieved level 136 if I recall correctly. Countless hours of heist grinding, job grinding, lots of shark cards bought. Sitting at something like 11million dollars. 2 houses, 2 garages. Everything I could ever want in the game. I had things that weren't even obtainable anymore. I was thrilled with where the game was going. Then.... I get bored; So I quit playing for 2 months.

A friend asks me, "Hey come play GTA with me let's wreck some kids". Sure why not. I get on for about an hour and we do just that, wreck some kids. I log off for the night and log in the next day to a 10 day ban. I was beyond baffled. How could I be banned when I didn't do anything? Surely rockstar support can help me. So I call in an attempt to figure out what is going on. I get fed a rehearsed line about bans being the result of online modding etc etc. I ask for a supervisor, the supervisor says the same thing. I ask for his supervisor. He says there is no one above him available and I was unable to appeal my ban. His reasons are as follows.
"Just accept the 10 day ban."
"If you weren't really doing anything then in 10 days you can play again and nothing will be lost, just take a break".
He neglects to tell me that the system was going to take all of my money and I would have to start over. Grinding countless heists/jobs or buy a large sum shark card (which is ultimately what they wanted me to do).

I come back around 12 days later and play for a few hours. Nothing out of the ordinary happens. I then got off for the night. The following day I got back on and was banned again. This time for 30 days. I think to myself "No &*%#ing way, this isn't possible". I call AGAIN and get the same rehearsed line AGAIN from both the first and second level of support (always ask for a supervisor). Except this time something was different. This time I was being allowed to appeal my ban. I thought for sure I would be exonerated of these allegations. Nope. I was told that I must have been hacking if their skynet system banned me. That there is nothing they can do and that "evidence of illicit activity" was found on my account. So I ask them to check again and they do. Same result.

At this point I start thinking ahead. "What happens when I get back from this 30 day ban?". "I'm just going to be banned again for the same false reason?"
They reply, "that shouldn't happen sir". I reply, "Shoulda coulda woulda. It's happened twice now so what makes next time any different. No variables have changed. If I record all of my gameplay from now on will that protect me? If I am indeed banned upon return to your game can I use the footage as proof of my innocence?"
"Yes", I was told. Not maybe, not "we're not sure". I was told "Yes, that will suffice".
So I did just that. I recorded all of my gameplay. Unfortunately "all" only ended up being roughly 2 hours the night I was unbanned after the 30 day ban because I was immediately banned permanently after logging off for that night.

This is starting to get a little longer than I expected so I'll cut it short. I tried to appeal the permament ban. I thought "I have video that I didn't do anything, surely this time it will be different.... they will have to unban me". NOPE.
I'll just end my review here and link my evidence. The videos of my gameplay and their final reply to me in my appeal where I linked them the videos.

TL;DR: ROCKSTAR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE AND IF YOU BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL BE BANNED BY SKYNET SIMPLY FOR BEING IN THE SAME LOBBY AS A SCRIPTER (WHICH WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN).

Edit: According to various sources (denied by Rockstar when I called them today) I was banned for MSI Afterburner/RivaTuner. This would make sense to me now that I think about it. However my review remains unchanged because they are doing absolutely nothing to fix the issue. I was told that I am not allowed to appeal my permanent ban because their system is flawless and does not falsely ban people for any reason. The support supervisor (Kyle) even acknowledged that he had heard of the MSI/Riva complaint but that it was "false". So yeah I'm still in the same place I started. Still will never support another Rockstar game for as long as I live.

I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND GTA V or GTA ONLINE!!!!

I like many others have had my account mistakingly suspended and reset recently due to a new anticheat script used by Rockstar. This is leading to the banning of innocent players with no reversal appeal, follow up investigation or notice to the player of the offense.

I've been playing Grand Theft Auto Online legit since GTA IV in 2008, I have over 600 hrs of gametime if you include my time on Xbox One. I loved the whole series since top down. But in 3D GTA the pay2play is top of the line. Shark cards really leave you feeling like you were just taken by a shark. I've spent more money on this game than I'd care to admit. But I never cared to cheat, hack, mod, whatever. I played the game legit with my friends and just dabbled time to time after no one played anymore.

Now I can't trust Rockstar at all... because I don't harrass other players or even play with old friends, just by myself every once in a while, but now I'm banned for some mysterious offense without justification or human attention to the situation. When requesting an explanation I like everyone else with this problem have been met with an automated reply:

"Hello SensiSoulja,
Thank you for contacting Rockstar Support. GTA Online bans are triggered by a number of factors, including modding in GTA Online, exploiting or abusing game mechanics, manipulating protected game data and code, or otherwise interfering with other players‚Äô gameplay experience.
All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed. For more information on the GTA Online Suspension and Ban Policy please see https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/articles/229514247.
Best regards,
Rockstar Support"


I was playing a game in GTA online setting up my hanger because I haven't played for awhile and needed it for my Akula I bought after selling a bunch of old cars. My brother gets in the house from work so I went to talk to him for maybe 8 minutes... came back to the game expecting to be kicked for being AFK. But this time it says I have been suspended til July 1, 2018, if and when I come back my account will be reset... I don't know what happened, but I don't mod, hack, or do any other nefarious activities online at all.

After doing some research I find out apparently there is a newly implemented Anticheat program that they claim is very accurate at detecting hackers, modders, manipulators, and harrassers. Plenty of posts and videos have been put up on social media about people getting there accounts suspended and wiped, or banned by mistake, with zero appeal policy and no investigations or follow ups.

Not only will not be buying another game from Rockstar again, but I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND GTA V because the chances of being banned and wiped fraudulently seems inevitable until they fix this glitch in the system.

Fun Fact: Whenever your connected to the internet and playing this game, you ip address is being globally broadcast through the rockstar launcher. This means other players with mod menus can set alerts to notify them whenever you go online. They can then force their way into your lobby, even if private, and troll you until they get bored. Rockstar is aware of this issue, but for some reason wont address it.
DO NOT PLAY ONLINE WITHOUT A VPN.

Even if you can get past all that, the state of pc online is so distraught that it makes the game unplayable. There are modders in every public lobby, so your either constantly getting spawn killed and cant get anything done, or the lobby will be so glitchy that it will eventually crash and kick you, or force close the game.

The only way this game is tolerable is in a private lobby. Doing this will cut out most in game content though, as most content is only available for play if your in a public lobby. Playing in a private lobby, in my opinion, also defeats the purpose of playing an online game; unless you are only playing with a set group and you are all only on at the same time.

I have close to 500 hrs in game. If this helps for reference on my experience.

Just bought the game and played it for two hours. Then I log in the next day to see I got banned for 30 days with no explanation whatsoever.

I guess real life robbery is one of the new features Rockstar decided to tack on or something.

Yes. I would recommend this game for the Singleplayer mode.
The muliplayer however..

When I first bought this game I didn't even care for the multiplayer. I spend over 350+ hours in the singleplayer alone and it was great. Plenty of stuff to do, plenty of fun to be had with some minor problems here and there. But nothing to be worried about.
When I started the multiplayer, everything appeared to work just fine. It looks more like a loadingscreen simulator but there is still plenty of fun to be had. The sheer amount of stuff to do is amazing and with some friends you can have hundreds of hours of fun. But then everything changed when Rockstar attacked..

Now I cannot find a single game without hackers, modders or whatever the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you call them. When I still had a low-level character, I met a few hackers and they were generally nice people. They played along in heists and missions and just did their own thing and had fun by themselves without bothering the other players.
But now it seems they have turned extremely hostile. Blowing up your vehicles, dropping you from high altitudes, spawning a tsunami of cars on your head, putting people in lift cabins, going on a rampage while being invulnerable to attacks.. It's just ridiculous, unfair and extremely childish.
Rockstar has failed miserably in removing these hackers from their game. They are banning more innocent players than hackers with their new automated system.

Yesterday (7th of May, 2017), for example, out of the blue a hacker gave me 17 million dollars. You may think 'Allright! More money to spend! finally I can buy that Yacht and modified car I've been working my ass off to obtain!'
But you'd be wrong. I IMMEDIATELY left that game so the amount I got wouldn't be rising even further.
Why? Because Rockstar is now also punishing players who OBTAIN money from hackers, whether it was obtained voluntarily or not. Now I am terrified of Rockstar's "Banning machine of Death" and affraid to play the game again for fear that my level 112 character will be reset and all of my work will be gone without any hope of getting it back.

Hackers, you're not trolls. You're not funny. You're not clever.
Call me old-fashioned or a big soft ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but in my book, you're all a bunch of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• whose parents did a lousy job teaching you the value of respect. Just because you're anonymous on the internet doesn't give you the right to be a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, nor does it justify your actions.
And Rockstar, get your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in order and make sure these people stop terrorizing your game.
I'll change my recommendation of the multiplayer to positive when they start to put more effort into the anti-cheat.
For now, buy this game if you want to play the single player. If you only want to play the multiplayer, I strongly recommend you wait until this problem has been fixed.

Do not buy until they fix or remove the launcher. Been playing for years but the launcher will not even let the game start anymore.

Support for this issue has been a waste of time and rockstar refuse to accept that their launcher is the issue, despite there being no issue playing before the update and many others now being unable to play.

Incompetent implementation of a feature no one asked for.

Great storyline, incredible gameplay, great graphics. But unfortunately the developers themselves have stolen the multiplayer by their inaction in relation to the cheaters. It's terrible and unacceptable, I was ready to ignore the children in this game, but cheaters are just awful.

don't misunderstand me. i love this game, That being said it is not geared towards new players at all. free content sounds great in theory, but in practice it means every mission underpays severely, and everything you can buy costs a crazy amount of money. there is a tutorial for online, but it has not been updated since the original release in 2013. if a new player starts now, they get endless phone calls telling them to buy multi million dollar properties, with no explanation on how they should get the money, or where they should start. the players who do make enough to buy these properties become leaders of criminal enterprises, which sounds cool, but only means that you have more to spend money on, and now you have a target on your back. For example if you are sourcing crates for CEO warehouses, as soon as u pick up the first crate, the game sends out a session wide ping, and actively tells other players to come kill you and destroy your cargo for cash and rp. how much cash do u get for this, 2 grand and minimal rp, how much of the CEOs money did u just waste, 18 grand at the high end, plus 5000 for each death they suffered at your hand. this does not sound like it would be much of a problem because everyone is in cars on the road, right? WRONG!! let me introduce to you the oppressor mk2. the developers at Rockstar games decide to create the most powerful griefer tool ever created and unleash it for the low, low price of 30$ in real world currency, or 3 million dollars in game. what is the oppressor u ask? the 0ppressor is a flying hoverbike with perfect homing rockets that can not only lock onto cars, but also individual people. really rockstar? why is this a thing? oh and dont get me started on the hacking problem. modders can do whatever they want, whenever they want, to whoever they want, and they cant be stopped, even after you switch lobbies, anything they spawned or change stays with you. modders can force players out of any vehicle, force teleport players into cages, or just spawn explosions and kill everyone at once. how many people are in each lobby? 30 people per lobby is not bad when the game is server based, OH WAIT, when the game re released for next gen they made it p2p. for 30 people anywhere in the world to be allowed in one session, and rockstar thought it was a good idea to use a system designed for 10 at the hard max, and that is with good internet and good netcode, which this game does NOT have. lastly because of how competitive the game is due to the freeroam businesses, this games playerbase is among the most toxic player base i have EVER seen, players grief eachothers businesses just because they are bored. ROCKSTAR I BEG YOU, please make businesses available to work in private sessions so that solo players, and friend groups can play in peace. one last thing, shark cards are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and dont give enough to be worth it, no matter what sales you have at the time. PS THE STORY MODE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY

This review is for GTA V Online, not the singleplayer GTA V. GTA V's singleplayer is great for what it is but most people buying this game in 2022 will be purchasing it for the online experience.

GTA V Online has such an amazing groundwork. A beautiful map, tons of content, and a plethora of things to do.

All of the above features are thrown out the window by the amount of modders and cheaters in the game. While many people would argue that there aren't that many of them or that they don't affect the experience, both of these statements are just untrue. From my experience, almost every public lobby has at least 1-2 modders in it. These "modders" and the amount they can do outside the game's boundaries is absolutely unacceptable.

They can spawn unobtainable vehicles, become invincible, fly, explode the entire map, teleport, become NPCs such as animals, lock you into a cage, crash your game instantly, and many other things. If this wasn't enough, they can violate your privacy. They can force you to type things into chat and even SEE YOUR IP ADDRESS. It's questionable if having a VPN will help this, though many have said that it definitely will, and I strongly advise using one if you do happen to be playing.

Your first thought would be to report these people to Rockstar, correct? Well. Modders get alerts when you send a report through the game, which allows them to delete them before they even reach Rockstar. That's right. You can't even report these cheaters which can be an actual threat to your game experience, your Rockstar account, and your real-world well being.

On top of all this, Rockstar as a company is just completely awful. They have taken most customer support down for the game, so most email reports will not work to get any cheaters banned even with video proof. However, they do have ban waves in which they ban accounts of suspected cheaters every month or so. Hilariously, my account was falsely banned for 30 days and my entire character reset. All of the 95.4 hours you see at the time of writing this review was erased for existing in a lobby with a modder, something out of my control and completely without my consent. I had never received a warning nor committed any offense on my GTA or Social Club account before this.

This game is outdated, not supported by the developers, and swarming with cheaters that can put you at risk.
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR THE ONLINE.

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

There's a lot of review bombing because of the new launcher. Having another launcher isn't great... we already have too many, but it's not strictly worthy of a negative review.

However, the reason for my negative review is that the game is now completely reliant on the launcher. The services behind the launcher are down, which means I can't even play the offline mode!

It should never be the case that an offline game cannot be played due to online services not working correctly.

The CEO of Take 2, GTA's publisher talking about how he will force microtransactions into every single one of their games, they want more the $60+ that we all pay for the game but hundreds over the course of your play time regardless of the game.
Educate yourself, read how bad these people are know your enemy as a gamer, as a consumer, is: https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/309190/TakeTwo_plans_to_only_release_games_with_recurrent_consumer_spending_hooks.php
Single player, still good, as with most if not all GTA titles thus far, playing 3 different characters is both at times tiring and fun. One of the 3 is the least interesting, that being Franklin, his character was the least fleshed out yet was made out to be the glue to the group. The gameplay is mostly better and for it's time it looked great though now visually not as impressive, there are however still instances where the world lives and you just sit back and watch.

By now you already know what the story is about, you do heists, which compared to PD2, are quite well done and make you feel like you're actually getting something out of it after you've planned for several set-up missions. Your characters level up their traits so the now bog standard RPG elements are built into the game, for better or for worse which means at times a lot of grinding in order to get better which again is forced and boring in any game. All in all the story is worth it so long as you find the game on sale, NEVER pay full price for this title as it is simply not worth $60 for a 4 year old game, period.

Now the online aspect of GTA5, where to start.... well it WAS a fair sandbox where you could enjoy getting killed by random a-holes in the server but now you can get that same feeling while you're flying, riding in a tank, anywhere you go you will be harried by other players in Freeroam. It was a horrible design choice and I will never understand what they ultimately thought would happen. That's just the crappy overworld, joining matches is a chore if you can even find anything then have fun with the infinite number of game modes that Rockstar keeps shoving out of the door to keep people playing because you'll never find a game mode beyond it's initial introduction. By the way that‚Äôs if you aren‚Äôt killed by the countless modders that have been a problem since day 1 of the PC release but does Rockstar do anything? No they go after the victims rather then the offenders.

On the subject of stability or how good of a port GTA5 is over all, it is pretty good but it also isn't, the load times are insane, even having the game on an SSD it can take at times an unlimited amount of time to load/connect to an offline lobby. While the game runs fairly well Rockstar clearly did not make sure that stability and reliability was mirrored during loading and connecting to a lobby. Sorry but a 4 year old game if it's well optimized should not take 5+ minutes to load on an SSD or any hard drive for that matter, period.

How they treat their paying customers and loyal player base is also shameful, their support staff, if you can call them that, do nothing but read from prefabricated responses and treats you like you caused the issue to happen. They constantly suggest over the top things to fix completely separate issues, like uninstall our 50+ gigabyte game and reinstall it in order to fix a connection problem. Not to mention the countless false positives for account bans and account wipes, which means that even a straight as an arrow player can and will get banned or have all of their cash wiped entirely from their character just because their ‚Äústate of the art trusted anti-cheat‚Äù system flagged your account. They constantly blame the victim rather then the cause and their support staff are instructed not to speak to anyone regarding bans or said money wipes. They have constantly denied any and all wrong doing on every account even when given mountains of evidence they are staunch in their ‚Äúbelief‚Äù that you are the problem and not their system.

Making money, which is the only way to really get anywhere in the game, because it's not like I want to play the game that I bought, no I want to literally work for hours at a time grinding missions, heists, game modes, etc. Just to get anywhere in the game. If you don't grind for cash or pay for in game money you will suffer, the poor are indeed the lesser class in GTA Online with no real way to gain serious money if they can't find the means or the tools. You can't get the tools if you don‚Äôt have the money and if you don‚Äôt have the tools you can't make the money. It's a horrible circle and it does not make a fun game to just enjoy, because you can't because it's work, you're quite literally working within the game universe. If you own a business, you're doing work, if you're trying to make money via heists (which is no longer the best way to make money these days, anymore anyway) you work and grind for DAYS on end. With the amount of time that I spent working in GTA Online, comparing their own pricing for Shark Cards I would have spent thousands of dollars to give you some perspective and I still don't own everything, not even close. Everything in Online is now priced so that it all but forces you to buy Shark Cards which Rockstar's fee to pay microtransactions. The best part about them now is that they are totally worthless, with each update that Rockstar releases the items get more and more expensive to the point where even the $100 Shark Card for $8 million, won't even buy you a car or two, where as before when the game was first out you'd be hard pressed to spend all $8 million. It is done on purpose and now that Take 2's CEO has consistently come out to the public and investor meetings and stated that he treats customers by how they spend on his games. That should tell you what kind of horrible person and horrible company Take 2 and Rockstar have turned into.

Their CEO is on record comparing paying human customers to minnows, dolphins and whales, these dehumanizing categories put gamers into their spending habits, if you spend very little and simply grind for days on end for your cash well you‚Äôre a minnow, if you buy money constantly then you‚Äôre a whale. These are the people running Take 2 and Rockstar, these are the people saying making games is too expensive, the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù who compare human beings to aquatic creatures based on their spending habits.

Do yourself and your fellow gamers some respect and avoid this title, educate yourself on how badly Take 2 and Rockstar have been treating their own paying customers for the past 4 years and realize that it will NEVER go back to the way it was. Take 2 and Rockstar will never be the same again, and when this microtransaction bubble bursts, because it will, Take 2 and Rockstar will be gone because they've now made sure that if their ideas fail their companies fail. It's better to please your investors then your actual customers, the ones who make your fame possible. Spend your money on another more deserving company, please.

2.800+ hrs on record and still playing. What an amazing game!

- The city of Los Santos is surrounding regions of riddled with fine details and wacky pedestrians. The world is feel so lived in thanks to the fact that there is so much hidden beneath the surface. I mean literally their secrets in the ocean if you're willing to explore them!! ;D Not only that though just hidden corners of the map, woods, mountains, there's always something weird turbine. Now of course the city of Los Santos feels unique and alive. You know with people bustling around, cars, traffic. Typical open world crime game stuff they have a really nice eye for detail down to homeless people sheltering themselves in the Hollywood upper class being themselves. GTA 5 is also unique for pulling up the less populated rural areas and making them feel like people actually live there not just like a boring flat landscape with a few trailers like many other games simply do it. No no no!! ;D By sandy shores in particular. Yes it's mostly trailer parks but with convenience stores, strip malls, parking lots and abandoned buildings. it really makes you feel like a place people exist in and not just a goofy parity. GTA 4 and 5 in particular just feel like convincing real places even if the majority of your interaction with people just blowing them up. 10/10

- Multiplayer is so fun because it gives a real feel of being able to run around the city and do whatever you want. I think what makes this game work is that it has an incredible sense of immersion in city life. No other driving game or first person shooter that I know of gives you this much freedom. This game can give You a way to have fun!! ;D I like it so much.

Give it a try. Who knows? You might like it too. If you do like it, then I wish you many hours of fun with it.

I've never used any kind of hack/mod or done anything illegal in two years that I played GTA5 and online (over 1.2k hours) when R * resolves to ban my account for no reason for a month.
In R * Support page is saying that all online content is deleted, if it occurs, will have to seek legal action against the company.
I am awaiting a response from the support, with a justification and information for revocation.

Like many others, i poured hundreds of hours into building my empire online, only to have literally all of my funds removed from the game entirely ( this is after buying the edition that gives you 1.350 Million to start with. Rockstar accused me of cheating by association from being in a game where modders frivolously threw out cash or added in game money to my account.

Sadly they removed every dollar I earned ingame including the ones I payed for and left my account with $0. Guilty by association i suppose. What a waste of time and a poor way to treat your customers.

I don't recommend this for anyone that wants to deal with an idiot tech support team. The main story is great don't get me wrong but GTA Online? HAH a joke. You can make your way to the top , eventually earn everything , have the stuff you always dreamed of.. only to have a hacker join your session, change you into a flying guitar then get banned by rockstar for hacking yourself due to some other hacker? GOOD JOB ROCKSTAR.

Rockstar tech support just slams a copy paste reply down to your appeal stating that all bans are final even if it isnt even your fault. SO i would say play the game on a friends system but DONT buy it for yourself. Especially if you want to get banned due to the poor system scanning by rockstar where the innocent get banned and the hackers are the ones that dodge the bullet.

Again Thanks Rockstar for the horrid Tech/Customer Support

When it comes to the campaign you are gonna enjoy it because it is really good, but the main reason for people coming to play this game is GTA Online for sure and I can tell you that it's current state is terrible ! Why ? I have 400 hours on PC, plus another 400 on ps3 when it came out, so I'm gonna try to be as clear as possible.

GTA Online is about making money by playing missions, heists, doing jobs like stealing cars and selling them, sell cocain from Cocain lab, selling weapons from bunker where they are made etc., and you can spend that money on cool cars, luxury appartements, weapons, private jets, helicopters, war vehicles etc. Sounds cool right ? Well there is a problem.

At beggining when the game came out the prices for these things were reasonable, but now in the last couple of new updates and with Import/Export things, the prices are just awful. They keep getting higher and higher and it has become so much harder to buy cool things that you want and in that way, they are trying to make you buy their "Shark Cards" which is really not worth, even the 75$ card that gives you 8.000.000 $ is not enough, you are gonna need more than that to buy things here, because when you buy something, you still have to costumize it if you want it to look and be better which also really costs. If you wanna get the money normally, you can either repeat the heists or do the Import/Export jobs since those ways are best for making money, but they still don't give you the money that you really deserve nowadays and for Import/Export jobs, it really takes a lot of time to get the money that you need, even friends that help you can't get the deserving money. For example, I still didn't even manage to sell the weapons from the bunker cause it really takes a lot of time for them to be ready for sale and btw, the only way to get the stock ready for sale, for either weapons, drogs, weed, whatever, is to be active in session, ONLY ! The stocks can't get full while you are for example playing heists or some missions or car races with your friends. And when I want to sell a product, for example two cars with my friend, I will get 200.000$ while my friend is only gonna get 20.000$ ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ! That's how Rockstar is trying to keep their players playing here, by spending thousands of hours repeating the same things that are really NOT worth and they try to make you buy their ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• "Shark Cards" and even that is still not worth your money at all ! Please for the love of GOD, don't fall in to a trap thinking that buying shark cards is gonna help you. This really shows how Rockstar became greedy. You think " Yes ! There is new content coming and like every, it's FREE ! ", but when you see how expensive the content is, you just get really disappointed. Here is the best example of it, when the first heists came out, you only had to buy an appartement which had a specific room for that and the cheapest one was about 250.000 $ which was not that hard to get and now you can play 5 heists, but with these new ones that just came out, you have to buy a facility to play the heists and the facilities cost from 1.500.000 $ ???? ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• THAT ! It's faster to get bankrupt here, then to be rich, SO WHAT'S THE POINT !

If you wanna play this game because of the campaign, go for it and I suggest you to get it on sale, but if you wanna enjoy GTA Online, you will maybe like it at beggining like I did when it came out, but that was when prices were reasonable and when you figure out how expensive new content has become, not to mention hackers and unfair bans, you will see how horrible GTA Online really is. Yes, you can also ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• around with your friends and race, but it's really not worth your time if you are gonna be doing only that, even for that you need money, especially if you wanna have fun with cool things.

Put in a nutshell: amazing game, terrible community.

But first things first: The single player campaign is one of the best I ever played. The concept of playing three characters is a welcome addition to the GTA formula and absolutely pays off. As with all the previous GTA's the NPC are fantastic. I thought that Brucie from GTA IV was the craziest character ever, until Rockstar introduced Trevor in GTA V. Character and mission design are top notch. Also the level of detail of the game world is incredible. Too bad that Rockstar has never released any single player DLC.s.

Now to GTA Online: The concept is amazing as well and the game is continuously updated with new content. I like the heists especially. The downside is that you definitely need other players for them and that it takes ages to find co-op partners especially for the heist set-up missions where money and reputation rewards are scarce. When you finally find enough players people often drop out in the middle of the mission which leads to an instant fail and you have to find another team. Not to mention all the player-killers in the open world and the long load times in general... However, if you happen to find decent people to play with or play with friends the game is an absolute blast.

A word on the Rockstar Launcher: Sure it is completely unnecessary that there is yet another launcher to torture PC players with. After the launch in September 2019 the game crashed regularly thanks to the launcher. As of November 2019 it seems like Rockstar managed to solve these problems and the game is running stable most of the time.

All in all an amazing game, but especially GTA Online could still be so much more.

GTA V Online or: How I Learnt to Stop Worrying and Love the Hackz0rs.

TL;DR Single player game isn‚Äôt as good as GTA IV. Only play online if you‚Äôre going to cheat. Read on to find out why (long read).


I started playing this game in October 2017. I‚Äôd just got my sweet gaming rig after using Apple for years due to work obligations. At the time, I read the negative reviews saying that players who didn‚Äôt cheat were getting banned for cheating and everything was being taken away. I scoffed. They must have done something wrong. That wouldn‚Äôt happen to me.

As someone working full time, I spent around $150 on Shark Cards to unlock missions and the stuff I wanted to do. A sweet ride. A nice motorbike. Harrier jet. I tend to just log on now and again and drive about. Maybe do some Hangar missions. My guy is at level 20. I only have driving and flying skills maxed out. All the other skills aren‚Äôt even at level 3. $3 million in the bank. Not really the account of a hacker.

Fast forward to May 8th and my account has been banned. It‚Äôs a temp ban, but my character is reset and everything I have bought will be taken away from me when the account comes back online in July. Furthermore, if I keep infracting on the games ToS, it‚Äôll be a full ban next time.

This leads to somewhat of a conundrum. Obviously, if I was a cheater, I would know exactly what I had done wrong. However, as a 100% legitimate player, I have no idea what I did, or what warranted this ban. Indeed, if you play legitimately, then how can you play more legitimately in the future?

All attempts to contact support have ended in failure. ‚ÄúAll bans are final.‚Äù is parroted back at me. No one can tell me why I was banned. This account, then, is ruined. If I know I have done nothing wrong, and as such don‚Äôt know why the account was banned, what could I possibly do to prevent a ban in the future? Especially if Rockstar have simply closed the door on me when I ask for help and clarification.

Researching some more into this recent ‚Äúban wave‚Äù to see if there are other honest players banned like me, I discover that used accounts can be bought for as little as $5. In addition to that, there are apparently many free mods and cheats out there that can go relatively undetected online, and unlock everything. Apparently, there are also paid for cheats (I don‚Äôt know how much these cost yet), but one gamer I came across seems to maintain that he was banned because he used cheats he‚Äôd paid for. If he‚Äôd stuck to the free ones, he claims he probably would have been ok. So, for $5, you can have access to everything in GTA V: Online, as well as apparently more (max all skills, max all unlocks, no wanted level, infinite ammo etc.).

From personally using Shark Cards, it‚Äôs my estimate that to unlock everything legitimately, you‚Äôd probably need to pay somewhere between $4000-$5000.

As you can see, you can pay $4000-$5000 and get everything, and probably have your account banned, or $5, get everything, and most probably have your account banned. But then after it‚Äôs banned, just spend another $5 again.

From this I can conclude that there is absolutely no reason to play this game legitimately. There is a high probability you will be banned for no reason and have everything taken away, with no chance to appeal or find out what happened. If you use the cheats, you will also probably be banned, but you‚Äôll have access to everything and may have a lot more fun with all the added extras.

Therefore, I highly recommend this game, but only if you‚Äôre going to cheat. If you want to play this game legitimately, I would buy something else.

Also,
F
U
C
K Rockstar.

I was waiting in a lobby while on the phone.
Hacker comes in and drops cash like crazy, I get banned somehow.
I've had this game for 4 days and paid for a shark card and criminal starter pack.

I use to love this game, but the ridiculously overpowered rocket bike has completely ruined it. Now every server I join over half the players are flying them around just waiting for you to run supplies then destroy you instantly. Even if you manage to kill one or two there are 5 others on rocket bikes taking their shots. How is it even feasibly possible to deliver supplies in a rotor plane in free mode, what a joke.

I will say though, Story Mode is great.

Playing online is a nightmare now days.

There are so many hackers modding the game playing in god-mode, crashing your game on purpose, kicking you from sessions, and just constantly pestering you.

I got perma banned from GTA V Online for violating terms of service of hacking because I had hackers in my session. I lost everything I worked long and hard for. This has happened to me 2 times now. My friend was also in the session with me after being out of country and he was also banned the same time I was.

Now, don't get me wrong... game is great and GTA V online is super awesome to play and get into. However, there are just too many hackers and Rockstar now bans anyone who is near a hacker, even if they are innocent. In their email they claim there is no way to argue the claim or to get your account back. So, all in all, due to that alone, I have to say no do not get this game for that reason...

To review GTA 5, one has to analyze the singleplayer and multiplayer part seperately.

Let's start with singleplayer: GTA 5 offers more variety and things to do than any GTA game before. It features 3 main characters instead of one, lets you use all the weapons you can carry, and offers tons of cars, bikes, trucks, planes, helicopters, and other means of transportation. Furthermore, there's a huge city to explore, along with large rural areas, mountains, small villages, and a giant ocean. Experience a fun, crazy story about crime, family crisis, and general madness which you can repeat at any time at any point if you feel like it or if you want to unlock certain achievements. And if you get bored of causing mayhem all the time, you can relax at a game of golf, tennis, or choose some other, non-violent activities. Hang out with your virtual friends, take a dive in the ocean, do some parachuting, the choices seem virtually endless!
However, compared to previous titles in the series, there are also some aspects which have been downgraded a bit. For instance, some of the old minigames are now missing (bowling, pool). Also, they cut classic side missions like taxi driving, vigilante, fire fighter, and medic. Furthermore, the AI and general behavior of the NPCs has worsened as well: Instead of being a useful tool to get healed on the spot, medics have now become completely useless. Also, cops are now working much less efficient compared to GTA IV, which had impressive AI mechanics for the side of the law.
Nevertheless, the game is already worth buying for its singleplayer part alone, and if you get bored, there are a ton of gameplay mods to enrich your gaming experience. Don't go into online mode if you have them installed though, it won't end well!

Speaking of online mode, this is a completely different world. First: you need to put a lot of time and work into it (which basically means grinding for months) if you want to have all the fancy stuff (see my playtime? About 250 hours of that is singleplayer). You start as a little nobody inside a sea of people with flying bikes, tanks, pink fighter jets, and other things you've never seen before in singleplayer, who won't hesitate to blow you up as soon as the got you in their crosshairs. Also there's modders, but you can avoid trouble most of the time by changing session once they've been discovered. This might not sound very inviting at first, but once you've established a foothold and found other people to play with, you can have a lot of fun. The things you can do in multiplayer are so many more that i can't even count them all, but the two most important things (if you like to make money) are heists and criminal businesses. Grab four friends (or random players, but it's more likely to fail then) and plan robbing banks, drug dealers, or get involved in a plot where you have to save the entire world! If your team is good, so will be the payout. Once you got your first million, get out there and buy a drug lab, research bunker, weed farm, or whichever else your heart desires. Set them up, look after them, and you will have a constant flow of guaranteed income. Watch for griefers though! They love to ruin other people's experience and generally ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• things up for you. There are ways to avoid them however without having to cancel whatever you are currently doing. After gaining your first millions, use your money to buy super fast cars, missile shooting armored trucks with machineguns on top, a jetpack, there's something for everyone (as long as you have the money for it). And if you prefer certain gamemodes instead of a freeroam world, you can go racing, join in a deathmatch, play tennis, golf, or play some of the contact missions offered by different contractors. And if you just want to have fun, you can always goof around with other players.

In short:
Singleplayer: great
Online: Even greater IF you have a lot of time and people to play with.

Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:

1. Loading screens take forever.

2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.

3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.

4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.

5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.

6. The f*cking loading screens X___X

7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.

8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.

9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.

10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make.

11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.

12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.

13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.

14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be).

15. And shark cards can gobble my balls.
_________________________________________________________________

Other than that, this game is an awesome game and very addicting, totally worth the money, you'll have tons of fun, especially in online mode, I promise :D

Amazing game in which I have spent over 400 hours in, particularly Online. Made some investments with the Starter Pack, took advantage of double RP sessions at certain times due to work commitments in real life, and I think 2 Shark cards to top it all up. Got some nifty rides and choppers in-game to play with, and I was so looking forward to doing it over-and-over while listening to some of the finest selection of contemporary music via the in-game radio.

But lo and behold, just only made RP 102 yesterday by taking advantage of double RP week, only to discover I got banned TODAY. Yup, an abrupt, unexplained lock-out for the next 30 days. And NO, ABSOLUTELY AND ADAMANTLY NO, I have NEITHER used any hacks NOR installed any mods to my game. To add salt to injury, my progress was reset. My hard, unmodded work, all flushed down the gutter with no explanation given. And NO, I AIN'T very tech-savvy so I can NEVER understand mods or hacks, let alone use 'em.

Seriously, man... what the F? Was about to write a nice review for ya until I got unjustly banned, and with no explanation whatsoever. You fellas at Rockstar had better get your damn act together implementing a better system at detecting hackers or modders without wrongfully or unjustly and without any form of explanation subjecting paying customers to this, this debacle.

Goodbye Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. It has been fun playing through your saga, and I would love to do so again, but this bovine excrement is an ABYSSMAL turnoff. And hello Geralt, Vito Scaletta, and Noctis and gang.

P.S. Hope bankruptcy catches up with your sorry, greedy corporate selves. You know who I am talking about. Pray one day you don't get served a class-action suit for this debacle.

P.P.S. The automated response to your ticket submission for complaints ISN'T helping anyone. Whoever your customer support is, I hope you receive your just dues when the time comes.

P.P.P.S. Don't even think I will fork out my hard earned cash for Red Dead Redemption 2, even if it comes out on PC. It can rust in a box like those six-shooters of old.

Update as of March 28, 2022 GMT+8: Frankly speaking I miss Trevor. Singleplayer still the best mode.

Story mode - 10/10
Online - developers want more money, in the game everything became very expensive, the game has a lot of unbalanced items.
RIP Online 2013 - 2015

Full of unresolved game bugs and glitches,
Heist members quitting like dumb little b*tches,
Take in-game picture of bullet drawings,
These are a few of my favorite things.

Cargo in Post-Op and frequent car crashes,
Chrome-wrapped sport cars and fighter jet dashes,
Shark cards to buy that Delorean with wings,
These are a few of my favorite things.

Sniped from the rooftops and MK II'ed by griefers,
Flame war in lobbies with tryhards and grinders,
Modders acting like they're queens and kings,
These are a few of my favorite things.

When I want to,
Play some online,
Cus I'm feeling bad,
I simply get stuck in a long loading screen,
And then I just feel more sad...

Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:

1. Loading screens take forever.

2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.

3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.

4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.

5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking retarded is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.

6. The f*cking loading screens X___X

7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.

8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.

9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.

10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make.

11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.

12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.

13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.

14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be).

15. And shark cards can gobble my balls.
_________________________________________________________________

Other than that, this game is an awesome game and very addicting, totally worth the money, you'll have tons of fun, especially in online mode, I promise :D

I've played this a fair bit, primarily in Online which will be the sole focus of this review.

Having played this for years, I've put up with a lot of stuff. Between greifers, modders, greifing modders, R* wiping my money for no reason - I'm especially careful to avoid modders giving away cash - and just a generally toxic playerbase... But I put up with it because, at its core, it's an incredibly fun experience with lots to do.

Lately, however... After the Epic free giveaway of the game a while ago, the game has quite literally had at minimum 3 modders per server, and one of them is always a guaranteed ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. If you stick your neck out in any way, you're going to be ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with, greifed, disconnected to singleplayer or your game will get crashed.

This is because suddenly every previously banned modder can get a FREE or VERY CHEAP account easily, and those who did get it for free don't give a damn if they get banned. Coupled with mod menu creators aggressively marketing their menus via Social Club (I've gotten 3-4 different random messages that are essentially ads, "feel like a god!" seems to be a popular tagline.) and you've got Online as of late. It has NEVER been this bad.

Over the course of the last couple weeks, I have been lucky to complete any public session event, mission or just plain having fun with people without a mod greifer interrupting in some way. Fight back effectively? Disconnected. Hide/go passive? Like that has ever helped. They can even stick objects on you that last between sessions - Sometimes obscuring your view completely requiring a full game restart.

"Do a public solo session!" I hear you whine.

Yes, this works somewhat for missions and sales, when you need to make money. But what if you just want to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• around with other players, the main attraction of the game for me - Or do PvP against the unceasing horde of tryhard MKII bike greifers, a common complaint I actually find fun to take down? ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of luck for the foreseeable future, as R* is and has been notoriously bad at dealing with this issue historically (and it's never been this bad!).

On top of all this, a thing that's always been a small issue in the past is rearing its head big time lately - Inability for your game to sync up and "save" your progress on the servers. There's nothing like spending an evening grinding money/crates/vehicles/heists for nothing because the game decided it didn't want to save it. No, forcing R*s servers to prioritize it by quit-not-quitting doesn't seem to work consistently, and this happens every night.

I've been willing to put up with a lot in the past, I'm not some carebear money high score grinder, I don't care about K/D ratios or any of that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. But being completely unable to play without getting disconnected for daring to exist outside of a heist or public solo lobby is completely unbearable. Even when I find a smallish session and start to have fun, it's never more than 20 min to half an hour before it's ruined again by an egocentric kid who threw 20 bucks at a mod menu.

You won't - Can't - fix it, so just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you R* for being completely inept moneygrubbing ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• for years, doing your best to ruin any fun you can have in this game.

EDIT: No, I won't get a mod menu. You guys are exactly what I'm complaining about, having more people trying to boot off eachother just makes the problem worse. Not to mention a lot of the "better" mod menus come with DC protection from those same methods anyways.

EDIT2: 276 game hours later...
Mod menus are so powerful that they'll intercept ingame reports, and they can spoof their names so you can't report them out-of-game either. The worst ones are the "good guy" modders trying to play vigilante crashing or messing with people they think deserve it; But half the time they get it wrong and only see the greifer getting his just desserts and assume you're the bad guy.

ON TOP of that, if they save your R* ID they can pull you in and out of sessions on command, so you're literally never safe if one sees fit to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with you specifically.

One of the best open-world games I have ever played.

If you have friends who are playing Grand Theft Auto V Online - you're good to go.
If not, then better stay away from the cancer.

Grand Theft Auto V Online consists mostly of -

‚úî infinite loading screens
‚úî toxic players
‚úî cheaters
‚úî zero customer service

Grand Theft Auto Five is the sequel to the highly acclaimed Simpsons Hit and Run. In Story Mode, you can play as three characters: CJ from San Andreas but not really, the guy from Redneck Rampage, and Nick from Left 4 Dead 2. The game features tons of action-packed missions, including robbing banks, stealing government secrets, and basically playing Payday 2 by yourself. San Andreas is a huge open world for you to explore, and features tons of open world areas, such as the Los Santos, a desert, some mountains, an ocean, and the town from Life is Strange. You can drive hundreds of vehicles based on real models and/or vehicles stolen from films and TV, all rebranded to avoid copyright lawsuits. In GTA Online, enter a world full of 10 year old children and 45 year old men, and get constantly attacked by people who spent their life's savings on in game currency. Grind missions for hours to make minute amounts of cash and watch XX_420_GAMER_XX wreck you for the fifteenth time with a flying rocket-launching motorcycle he owns because he stole his mother's credit card. Play for hours on end, until you realize you could have just bought Garfield Kart instead.

Rockstar told us the PC-version would be the ultimate version and they were right. I just love this game, the heists, the missions.. everything! 10/10 and it's running smooth. :)

Pros:
Beautiful graphics and city
Optimized game for pc
3 character switch
Smooth gameplay
Hours of fun
GTA online.


Cons:
Rockstar Support
No cloud save for story mode.
Rockstar social club integration itself.
Taking a long time to load sometimes.

I will never buy another Rockstar game again, I simply can't because they don't give me any other option.


Last year I got banned from online play. No, I'm not a cheater or hacker, which is why I'm writing this negative review.

What I assume happened is the following;
I hadn't played GTA since launch, but came across the "LSPD" mod on youtube. It's a mod that allows you to play as police singleplayer. I installed GTA and the mod and had a couple days of fun. I'm sure I accidentally pressed Online play with the mod loaded once, but killed the game right away.

Then I uninstalled GTA via steam, and didn't play for -months-. The Christmas holidays came around, I had some spare time and installed GTA again. I played Online for an hour and got a 30day ban.

I initially had no idea why, and no idea to find out, as there's zero response from support about bannings other than an automated response saying all bans are final. And to be honest I didn't care too much as I had only played for an hour, and didn't feel invested. I considered GTA5 Online to simply be broken. I uninstalled GTA again via steam and didn't think about it.

But a couple weeks later my brother said he had gotten GTA5 during the steam christmas sales. So we waited for my 30day ban to be over, and had a week of fun playing the game. But then exactly 7 days to the dot after the 30 day ban was over, I got a permaban. I assume I got flagged for another ban the second I logged in again and simply had some kind of 7 day cooldown timer. Or perhaps they have/had a weekly (un)banwave I was "lucky" enough to play in between.


Again I tried to contact support, again no response but the automated one.
I tried asking for help on the forums, but there I got called a lying cheater, and actually harrassed by people, so gave up on that quickly.

While googling for answers, I came across the LSPD mod again, which reminded me I had tried it before. I had a eureka moment, searched my computer, and came across some residual LSPD files from MONTHS, and a couple of full game reinstalls ago. I tried to contact support again, but still no human response. I gave up.


Forward to now.
After getting constantly reminded on Youtube about GTA5 videos of clearly modded ONLINE play, I'm still pissed I got banned for what I can only assume were some residual files from a mod that didn't affect my online game at all.

And let's not forget, anyone who has ever played GTA5 Online, knows it's FULLLLL of REAL hackers/cheaters constantly messing up everyone's game by teleporting them around, killing whole servers, even dropping hacked money ontop of you.


So I figured I'd see if Rockstar support had gotten any better since last year.
To my surprise there's now a "I don't want to get banned", support request option. I'm pretty sure that wasn't there last year, so I at least got my hopes up on finally figuring out WHY I got banned.

What's a better purpose for the "I don't want to get banned" support request than someone who doesn't know why he was banned and wants to prevent it from happening again. But no, just another automated message saying all bans are final and cannot be appealed, even though I wasn't asking for an appeal. My second support request, stating my first request wasn't a ban appeal but an inquiry with information about my first ban because "I don't want to get banned, again", got the same automated message saying all bans are final.


Listen, don't get me wrong. If the anticheat system detected those residual files as malicious, I totally deserved the first ban.
BUT.
- I reinstalled the game several times. Technically I didn't do anything to the new installs, it did that to itself by not cleaning the folders it uses and not protecting itself from outside influences on a fresh install.

- I had no way of figuring out why I got banned the first time, so no way to prevent it from happening again. I'm still only guessing it were those files. The only victims of not letting people know why they are getting banned by an "anticheat" system, are people who have no idea why the anticheat singled them out because they weren't actually cheating. I mean, mister l33th4xx0r can hack as much as he wants till his first ban, and then has a good idea what to do to not let it happen again.

- Support is nonexistant, not for "I want you guys to have a look at my ban", nor "Can you at least help me to not get banned again", despite having a specific ticket request option for it.

- Again, both youtube and the game itself are FULL of real actual hackers/cheaters, and people using non malicious mods online seemingly for long periods of time with no risk, or even sense of wrongdoing, of getting banned during online play.


I think it's simple;
GTA5 has so many players, but also so many real hackers/cheaters, that they ban such an enormous amount of people every week, with thousands of them making false ban appeals, that they can't search, and perhaps don't care, to look for those few who deserve a second opinion because the banning is perhaps the result of an over zealous anticheat program on their side.

So I simply cannot buy another Rockstar game again, nor recommend it to anyone else. If I can't get support to at least figure out why I got banned, it may happen again in the future, and it may happen to you.

The singleplayer is great, funny, interesting, relatively balanced, has plenty of biting satire, details, etc. etc...

But anyone who has yet to buy this game ought to understand: singleplayer isn't the Rockstar's focus. It's GTA Online, which is an absolute dumpster fire of an experience. It's unbalanced, annoying, and often designed to be irritating in hopes you'll pay for the privilege of the game becoming fun, instead of just being a good experience on its own. All the content they've made for over five years is for multiplayer -- including the vehicles that WOULD work just fine in singleplayer if you put them there; they went out of their way to add a kill switch that removes them from the game if you dare try them out. Thankfully on PC that's laughably easy to mod around, but know that they put in the effort to withhold that from you.

One in five times, game softlocks loading into GTA Online(which takes forever, even with an SSD). It's always fun wasting more than five minutes on loading that will never end... It's much harder to catch on to when you expect such long load times in the first place.

Get on, and immediately get bombarded with job notifications and in-game telemarketers and e-mails. The job notifications you can at least silence(every time you launch the game). E-mails and telemarketers will only give you peace if you buy whatever it is they're selling, and if you're starting from scratch, that's an investment of several-hundred IRL hours or dollars to get your hands on one of every(baseline, un-upgraded) facility, just to make the obnoxious, perpetually-outstretched hand begging for microtransaction money to go away... Until the next DLC comes out and there's something else to sell.

Buy one of the businesses that you're constantly nagged about, and you'll have the pleasure of keeping them supplied and safe in order to aggregate supplies for you to sell for profit. This could actually be nice -- missions in freemode to steal supplies. Firefights, car chases, the works. Sounds like Grand Theft Auto! Well, it *would* be nice, if every business didn't have the MO of literally painting a red target on you for everyone in the server and saying, 'Hey! Kill this person and get a negligible amount of cash and RP!' Almost every freemode business endeavor that gives a worthwhile amount of money is made as tedious as possible. Any jerk using something faster than a turtle and stronger than a cap gun can rush over -- while you're driving a literal FedEx delivery truck up a mountain -- immediately kill you, and earn for themselves about a tenth of the value of the stock you're carrying (which took you two hours to accrue). The hope is you'll realize how unfun that "game" is, and pay MORE money to make the game better for yourself instead of taking your money elsewhere (which lots of people are... okay with doing these days?).

Ah, and there's of course the hackers, which are especially bad on the PC version of GTA Online. You'll find those in every session with four or more people -- no exaggeration. They'll get their kicks blowing you up on the spot over and over again, attacking you in while they're in godmode, teleporting into your vehicle and controlling it(or just halting it in place permanently), softlocking your game, kicking you from sessions, force-crashing your game, among other things. I had a real charmer the other day spamming hard-R n-words in the chat, and when I tried to report him, I was immediately hit with a network error and booted into singleplayer. They can literally detect your reports, block them, and boot you from the game -- automatically, on the spot. Lots of these exploits have been in the game since 2013, and hackers are only banned in non-negligible numbers of when the game receives a major update... Once every few months. Any given time more than one or two weeks after an update, it'll be infested once again.

Once you properly get IN a lobby, hang up on all the telemarketers, and hackers are bothering someone else for the time being... you'll likely just get a non-hacker using absurdly overpowered equipment come to harass you, instead. Anyone who doesn't already have the money and tools from playing the game a long time will get absolutely demolished by people looking to attack them, with their only recourse being Passive Mode(AKA agree to not be able to do 85% of what you normally could until leaving Passive). Incessantly harassing defenseless low-level players is a common pastime for people with overpowered equipment, a familiar concept for anyone who's played a game with moderation this poor; it's an excellent environment for players who enjoy being toxic. Around once a year, Rockstar will add some expensive gadget that makes fending off attackers miserable or impossible unless you also have the expensive, overpowered gadget; the Hydra, the Insurgent, the Oppressor, Explosive Snipers, the Deluxo, the Oppressor Mk II, the bloody Orbital Cannon. Oh, yeah -- that's another thing. People with enough money and the right facility can literally just nuke you from orbit and insta-kill you nearly anywhere on the map. No warning, no counter, you just better just memorize the location of every facility people MIGHT do that from and hide underground if anyone is in one.

TL;DR
I could write a book on all the reasons new players should take their money elsewhere. The game hasn't been balanced for seven years. If you don't already have the foothold of being level 120 with $10m in the bank, it'll cost you a LOT of time or real-life money to get to the part where the game can maybe be fun.

Singleplayer is pretty fun. Especially that we can use mods now. Except for the Liberty City mod that put GTA 4 and 5 together. Of course, Rockstar would probably lose money, so that was the only bad news about mods being back. No matter how much weeks/months/years it took to make it.

We also may never get DLC for singleplayer. If they do release it, not everyone will be playing online, and they won't buy shark cards. But we get this terrible Gunrunning ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• instead.

So about GTA: Online...
All they want is your money.
--It's very hard to get money. You'll spend hours just working for a few bucks.
--Modders in every lobby.
--Lots of items are TOTALLY overpriced.
--People getting banned all the time, when it wasn't their fault.
--People killing you all then time. And to make it even more fun, if you're doing a mission that you dedicated some time to, people can steal or destroy what you're doing to get cash and RP.
--Loading screens take forever. For me, joining online could take 5-8 minutes.
--List goes on.

Rockstar won't change. Many fans are gone. And also, how is this game still $59.99????

Rockstar has made it clear they do not support their players. With the massive pay walls separating you from any of the premium game content, unless you are willing to shell out tons of real money, you are not going to be able to experience it.

Hackers were in almost every lobby distributing wealth to players, however Rockstar has begun to ban hackers in addition to the players who receieved the money from the hackers. If the hacker spawns money on top of you and you are forced to pick it up, you are out of luck. Easy ban.

Thanks Rockstar for hurting your players, modding community, and turning yourself into the type of company that everyone has always despised.

As most people who are familiar with the Grand Theft Auto franchise I will not be reviewing the single player aspect of this game at all because there are countless reviews of that online.

Instead I will be focusing on the cesspool known as GTA: Online. The online aspect of this game has always been one thing and that is promising, I remember getting home excited on the 1st of October in 2013 (Crazy to think that that is 6 years ago almost) and loading into GTA: Online for the very first time, making my at the time god awful character (anybody who has played the old gen gta games can vouch that the character creator was even worse than it is now) and being so excited at this new world of possibilities, fast forward 2 weeks and this was all that myself and a bunch of my close friends would play, we would sink days on end into just roaming around the map having fun.

The world to us was limitless and we never got bored. I remember being the last one in my friend group to reach level 75 and unlocking rooftop rumble which we proceeded to grind until each of us was at least level 120 to unlock the last bit of content. After that all my friends kind of lost interest in the game, but not me. I started a hobby of collecting unique cars and meeting people and we would have car meets by the Los Santos Customs. This was an amazing thing for the then 16 year old boy whom I was. I still remember the excitement of the first christmas event when we woke up and the whole map was covered in snow, it was like an entire new experience.

One of the first games I got on my brothers ps4 was also to no surprise GTA V and again it was like a second wind to the game, there were more features on making your character look unique and the big one bigger lobbies and more new content to come. I played this on and off every time new content came out because I had my original character from my PS3 and they had a lot of money which I worked way too hard for, so the moment the DLC came out I would go on experience it buy all the clothing, cars, and properties I wanted and then played for a few days before leaving the game again.

During the 2019 Summer sale a few friends bought the game and I caved and got it as well, this was after a 4 year hiatus from the game so there was a lot to take in. I immediately got back to grinding away to get a high rank so I could unlock all that the game had to offer as well as to make money to again buy all the things I wanted. This led to me being up until 2 am on most nights for a few weeks just getting the most progress that I could. After making my way to Rank 100 and being satisfied I ran into a griefer who also had a mod menu at his disposal, he stated that everyone should make their way to the airport in game as he is going to be dropping money for people. I told him that I am fine since it was 2 am for me and I did not need his money. I was completely satisfied with working hard for my money. This person then dropped 2 bags of cash on me using their mod menu, then in game I saw my cash go up by $2 billion. I decided to log off because I didn't know what to do, and as I was attempting to write an email to rockstar support to ask if I could get this money removed from my account that's when I received the single most pathetic copy and paste email of my life stating that I have been banned for 30 days, this definitely made me feel betrayed as I was wrongfully banned for something that a lot of other people also get wrongfully banned.

Fast forward to the 12th of August and I got my access to GTA online back and I did the one thing I knew would keep me happy, I continued to grind with the free content I was given from buying the Premium Online edition of the game (To anyone looking to play online this is a great purchase) and I made my way back the where I was at least in rank withing 2 weeks again. I was happy with helping friends with their import and export missions and just all round messing around in the game. That was until today when I helped a friend deliver cargo for their Business as they had just started out. After the delivery I decided to modify a car that I had been looking to find for a very long time. After I finished modifying my car and making my way to my friend to show him this car, I got interrupted by a haunting message. You have been permanently banned from GTA Online. Please return to GTA V. This was followed shortly by the aforementioned copy and paste email but this one changed to say permanently.

Now I know that I was playing legitimately and I was not cheating so I do not know why I got banned, however I do know one thing. The people behind GTA Online do not care about people cheating in their games, you will spend a lot of your time trying to escape people who have godmode or aimbots or just people who are caging you and all round stopping you from enjoying your game. Those people might never get banned and if they do they will just buy a new account off of sites like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and get back to making money by modding peoples accounts. But if you are a legit player who spends a lot of time grinding to get money. You are more likely to get banned by them. I will never be supporting Rockstar Games again and that is a shame because as many of the other people who grew up with games, their games have always had a soft spot in my heart.

"He sits on his ass all day, smoking dope and jerking off while he plays that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game. If that's our standard for goodness... then no wonder this country's screwed." - Michael De Santa

STORY (No Spoilers)
Grand Theft Auto V pits the player into the roles of the three main protagonists: Michael, a married man suffering from a midlife crisis, Franklin, a gangster trying to make a change for himself, and Trevor, who's just a Canadian psychopath. The trio get together and perform all sorts of daring heists and escapades.

The game is action-packed with chases, gang shootouts, and intense heists that get crazier as the game goes on.
When you're not robbing a convenience store or shooting rednecks, you can partake in all sorts of activities. You can walk your dog‚ÄîChop, go golfing, play tennis, and even get a lap dance at the strip club (Sorry Roman, there's no bowling)!

GTA ONLINE:

The GTA Online Protagonist can be created according to the taste of the player to customize (gender or appearance). The player will choose a gender, then choose the parents and grandparents of the character to affect his/her appearance. Then, the player chooses how much the character spends his/her daily life; this will create the initial stats for the character and slightly change the appearance.

After you have finished creating your character, you arrive in Los Santos with an open welcome by Lamar Davis (Especially if you're a female). He then has you do a street race with him (and other new players, if available), and shows you to Gerald, a drug runner who'll give you easy jobs to start you off in Los Santos. After you complete this tutorial, you'll join a free roam session with up to 32 other players (Who'll either become your friend or your enemy).

There are multiple game modes in Online, including:
Free Roam - Run around with up to 32 of your closest friends (or enemies), causing chaos and other nonsense. You can also compete in mini-games, such as target practice, arm wrestling, golf, and tennis. If you don't like to be killed constantly by other players in Free Roam, you can play in Solo Mode, but you'll be unable to play game modes that require more than one player.
Missions - These are given out by characters in GTAV (Lamar, Gerald, Martin, etc.), and are co-op jobs with up to 4 players.
Survival - Try to survive up to ten waves of enemies with 3 other players.
PVP - There are multiple subsets of this, including: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch (Free for all), Vehicle Deathmatch, Team Elimination (You only have one life.), Capture (A twist to Capture the Flag), Objective-based missions (Complete a objective, while the enemy team tries to do the same), races, and parachuting.
Heists - These are my personal favourite. With up to three of your friends (friends are highly recommended, unless you want to fail the heist repeatedly), you can perform challenging and rewarding missions to obtain lots of cash and exclusive heist vehicles. Unlike basic jobs, these heists involve multiple sub-jobs within them called Heist Setups that must be completed prior to the Heist Finale. As the heist leader, you can set what crew member does what job and their pay for doing that job. Teamwork is essential because the entire team shares one extra life (or none at all if the dificulty is above normal), and if that life is expended, the current mission fails and you'll have to restart it.

There are multiple glitches in GTA Online, some are funny and weird, the others are exploits and game-breaking. So far I haven't seen any hackers, but I wouldn't doubt their existence.

Final Verdict
In retrospect, I give Grand Theft Auto V a 8/10
+ Amazing story
+ Excellent gameplay
+ Fun with friends, and fun without them!
+ Great graphics
+ GTA Editor
+ Heists are fun and replayable for more cash
- Glitches

After a break of a few weeks I log on only to be confronted by a message informing me that Rockstar stripped me of all the money I obtained legitimately by actually playing the game instead of cheating...
Without money this game is unplayable and to even reach a point where you have enough money to actually enjoy playing the game takes forever and feels more like a job than a game. And no, I will not pay for shark cards, because I already paid for the game... WHEN I BOUGHT IT!

If this is the way paying customers are treated, I can think of better ways to spend my money

Now, there sure are many good sides to GTA V and it's definitely a fun game to play.
But there's also soemthing that's very problematic.

1. Cheaters
2. Duping
3. Hoverbike (Opressor), an impossible-to-kill air scooter with homing missles.
4. Modded accounts
5.Banning both cheaters and innocent people.
6. Botters / idlers / leechers.

Finally after numerous delays and waiting forever it has arrived...

Rockstar did a really good job on this. The delays seem to have paid off. The game runs completely maxed out (ultra settings @ 1920x1080) on my laptop (GTX 780m 4GB SLI) and I get 40-60 FPS. Oh and the game is really fun too, a huge improvement from GTA IV. I don't think I need to talk much about the game because everyone on earth knows it's great already. If you didn't know it's great then I'll tell you right now - . A must buy if you haven't played it.
+ Huge improvement over Grand Theft Auto IV
+ Runs smooothly on mid range PCs
+ First person mode is amazing
+ Entertaining characters and story
+ No glitches at all yet
= Co-op in the story mode would have been cool
- First person mode doesn't work good for most missions
9/10

OPENIV IS BACK!
(an update was just released, and on openiv's about page, it looks like rockstar convinced take-two to retract the cease and desist)

UPVOTE THIS SO EVERYONE CAN SEE

(ratings are never going to be back though)

EDIT: OpenIV says "special thanks to rockstar games" now

Game is a cool concept but:
-Loading screens so long that it will take you to retirement age just to enter a game
-More cheaters than the average CSGO lobby
-Players so toxic and braindead you will question the state of humanity
-Money so hard to obtain, you may as well get a real life job to do so

So all in all 10/10-Got instantly blown up after loading into a lobby for 10 mins

its a fun game but I got banned due to a hacker editing my character in GTA online which then resulted in /me/ getting banned and having my character progress reset. I have spent 1200+ hours on my character, and I get banned for something I didnt even do.

PS You cannot appeal a ban of this kind. They dont care what you do, say or how much evidence you provide. If youre thinking of getting this game dont. Modders ruined it, and are ruining innocents now too it seems. Thanks Rockstar.

So I don‚Äôt really write reviews, I‚Äôm too lazy or just don‚Äôt have the time in my life.

But for this game I‚Äôm willing to bother, mainly because of the ATROCITIES that this game possesses. Single player is great sure, but online is such a bigger part of this game now, most people play it just for that mode. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen other reviews saying: ‚Äúmodders have ruined it!‚Äù and ‚Äúonline is no fun cos of hackors!‚Äù.

Well that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs true. All of it.

Allow me to put this as realistically as possible.

I have amassed a total of 420 hours on GTAV. Didn‚Äôt play the campaign, I had already done that when it first arrived on console. No, these hours are mainly online play. I‚Äôve grinded mission after mission to earn the cash. I‚Äôve spent hours buying, customizing and completing challenges. I now have a profile that has all the levelled unlocks, cars and guns you could ever want, making it a very hard earned profile.

HOWEVER, I have now lost most (if not all) of my desire to switch this game on, and I‚Äôm sure you have a pretty good idea of why that is. Nether the less, I shall give you an example of a typical session of online play if you were to enter the game today (which let‚Äôs face it, is the main reason why we play it).

Enter my first match. > begin attempt to have fun. > Player arrives on a bike and kills me to death. > very well, I shall retaliate by firing a rocket at his bike. > Rocket hits. > But wait, the player didn‚Äôt die. > Then quickly learn from further attempts and other players that he is using God-mode > I then attempt to use the player menu to ‚Äòvote to kick‚Äô him, as others were attempting to do the same thing > Turns out he has used a mod that removes his name from the player list, making it impossible to kick him out of the match. > I then call him out for using Mods (with restraint to call him many, many things) > At this point he proceeds to delete my car and spawn 100,000 things on my head, making my game crash to desktop (and probably anyone else who was near-by in game).

Now after lots and lots of match surfing, I can quite confidently state the following with applied calculation and experience:

If you buy this game for the online side of play, roughly 1 in 3 of your free-roam sessions will be rife with situations similar to this ^.


So to give you an evaluation:

If you are a normal player ‚Äì

Prepare to have unfair play, have your things deleted, and get crashed to desktop by modder‚Äôs whenever you challenge their actions, because Rockstar will never regulate and control this issue.

If you are wanting to be a modder ‚Äì

You can enjoy being invincible, gank on players then delete everyone‚Äôs things, and if they call you out you can just crash everyone, because you are a big man and Rockstar will never regulate or control this issue. Then they‚Äôll write negative reviews, losing the game its popularity to a point where it just becomes garbage. Then you‚Äôll have it all to yourself, and your mission to alienate everyone from online play will be complete.


To quote another game (that I would recommend more tbh):

‚ÄúWell done Stanley, everyone thinks you‚Äôre very powerful.‚Äù


P.S - The second biggest issue is the micro-transactions, and rockstar's ever vigilant attempt to take in-game money from you in order to force you into buying shark cards with real money. but that needs a whole review in itself to detail that issue (which i really dont have the time in my life for).


My only hope is that enough people will see this review and get it to the bench, so that maybe some people will decide not to ruin this game with bad modder/hacker behaviour.

06/16 Edit:

Rockstar did a ban wave and disabled the ability to use console (apparently), soo... yay?
Wonder if my moaning review had some sort of effect, anyway im going to leave this here just as a principle.

02/17 Edit:

Well here we are again. Rockstar have dropped the ball and now modder/hackers/whatever you wanna call them, have returned. Its worse than ever now. Back to the drawing board....

Playing GTA Online solo is nearly impossible as you're bound to come across 12 year olds using hacks, jets, and flying motorcycles to grief you at every corner. It's really surprising how so many people on this game will go out of their way to annoy you.

I'm leaving a negative review because TakeTwo sent a Cease and Desist to the OpenIV team. OpenIV is a modding software that helps enables a MASSIVE ammount of mods for Gta V and Gta IV. Basically modding is "illegal" so I am leaving this negative review. The game is okay, but this "No Modding Policy" is ridiculous and I will not stand for it.

*EDIT*

They eventually relented and changed their stance on modding but I will be leaving the original part of the review up. The campaign is a great campaign and worth playing. The multiplayer used to be good but honestly I cannot in good faith recommend the multiplayer. So, if you are getting this for singleplayer and mods, go for it. If you are getting this for multiplayer, it just isn't good in my opinion. You have to spend more IRL money just go be able to afford some of the things that are in the game due to the insanely high prices of the various new items.

35 year old gamer, on steam for 12 years, never hacked in any game, never have and never will.
ROCKSTAR has banned me once out of the blue and refused to respond, i gave up and allowed ban to expire and loaded in yesterday to find it finally had expired, so today i decide to go and enjoy a small game.. only to find out that now i have been PERMANANTLY banned for breaching T&C ... no actual reason for the ban, just a message saying your banned and you will never be unbanned, i got this game on PRE ORDER - be warned that if your buying the game for the online experiance you dont get to keep your account, when rockstar gets bored they will just ban you.

I do not, and have never run "scripts" or "mods" or "recording software" or ANYTHING that could possibly be considered other then default, yet here i am permanantly banned. BUYERS BEWARE.

I need to get my opinion/reccomendation out here.
Fair warning: this might seem like a huge review, but I hope it helps!


Out of all of the times and hours I have played GTA V, it's still a good and fun game to play. I can't say too much about single-player.
However, on multiplayer / online mode, with all of these updates coming out, it seems like EVERYONE is getting banned online for doing NOTHING! Whether you are modding or innocent, it doesnt matter at all!

Innocent people are getting banned for something that another person has done that is out of their control
(example: modder dropping tons of money to player)

Even if you do the tiniest bit of grinding and pull out a shopping spree with friends, Rockstar will just think that you're hacking because they will think you somehow magically pulled out $3.6M+ out of your crotch to pay for a luxary apartment with nice decorations.

Worst part about this is: you are unable to appeal your ban because it's a final decision by them. Rockstar WILL ROB YOU for your money!
Customer support SUCKS because when I tried to get support from a legit person (instead of getting an automatic message), they just threw out / deleted my support ticket like it was nothing when I just asked why bans are non-appealable and pointed out to them that their EULA & Policies are a little out of date. That is NOT a way to treat customers!
Seriously, as of right now (10/30/2018) when i'm typing this review, they havent updated their TOS for almost 1 year now. Rockstar WILL swallow your money just like any other gaming communities that do not give 2 $#!&$ about you. Rockstar expects you to call them a gaming business? I will just call them a fraud company that produces pay to win video games (just like EA for most people).

This was once a great game, but nowdays, it's just a huge disappointment with a big fan base.

I guess it's a good thing that I purchased this for cheap when it was on sale, but DO NOT pay for this game at full price!
I wish I can file for a refund, but sadly, I can't do that.

If you are looking for a fun game to play with friends that is similar to GTA V, play/purchase Garry's Mod!

I hate to have to give this game a negative. I really do, flat out makes me tired of it having to do so. It's a fun game, great map, wonderful level of detail, amazing amount of things to do. The single player story is awesome and if you plan on buying it for the single player I would recommend it. Played it during the PS3-era and really enjoyed it. Even online at the time it was fun.

But on to headache of why I have to give this a negative. Shark-Cards. Paying real money to get yourself in-game currency. I think it's trashed this game significantly. I get it, yea Rockstar you somehow need to make money to keep this game active and for the free DLC you've been providing thats available for all players.

First off. The price of these Shark-Cards and how much you get out of them. $100 for 8 million. Come on. Really? That buys you 2-3 top-tier vehicles tops because you have everything inflated in the market making it practically a grind nightmare. Hell, the Megalagon gets you halfway to a Yacht that's priced at 16 million. Literally, $200 worth of Shark-Cards for a single Yacht that you can't even drive around. From what I hear the things practically pointless and all you can do on it is change your clothes and sleep. Like if Rockstar did this the standard way and sold their DLC it would literally be priced at a couple or even several hundred dollars in their world. Or hell, $200 for a single thing that serves you literally no purpose. And I‚Äôm scared to even look up how amount of in-game currency I have to even get in order to buy every vehicle that's released in these DLC‚Äôs. Literally a massive grind nightmare.

Which leads to my 2nd point on Shark-Cards. Like, lets say I magically have the money to afford and waste on a couple thousand dollars worth of Shark-Cards (Rockstars Wet Dream). Than what? As a 90's gamer what in the hell is the point of doing anything like player missions, heists, cargo missions, etc if I already have everything provided cause I paid real cash for it. Maybe have fun doing them all once with really nice stuff, but that isn't really all that long to do and you have absolutely nothing to strive for in-game cause you already have everything...

Thirdly, Rockstar will do anything to this game and at all cost to get you to buy a Shark-Card. Raise prices of new vehicles and really just about everything they add. Lower payouts on missions not to mention long cool-off times so you‚Äôre not making so much so fast.. Increase costs of practically everything and make sure that it remains high for you, and I‚Äôll continue on that and why I mentioned it. Their whole world revolves on whatever it takes to getting you to buy a friggin Shark Card. It, just sucks frankly.

Now on to the CEO work. Ugh. This system that they have going on here, just doesn‚Äôt work. Nobody in their right mind is going to be your associate or bodyguard with these payouts. Nobody. Maybe if you can trick a scrub into working for you a bit before they realize they can make more money doing their own thing. Seriously, it isn‚Äôt worth it. There's absolutely no incentive for people to work for you‚Ä¶ but against you. Now that's when a bigger grind nightmare happens because every player in session is bound to screw you up. Like Special-Cargo for example, all it takes is one player in a fancy Hydra and its over. You‚Äôve lost tens if not hundreds of thousands on all this cargo that didn‚Äôt make you jack in the end. Which leads to people especially us PC gamers to resource monitor the hell out of a full public session and play it absolutely alone. And that sucks too. To fill a 111 crate warehouse would take you days worth of gameplay if done alone and hell a week‚Äôs worth doing one crate at a time to give you the better profit margin. Like what is this Rockstar? A job? Its supposed to be a game. Not everybody has that amount of free time like I do sadly. But if you have $20 to spend on a Shark Card it will give you close to the amount you‚Äôd make‚Ä¶ and that gives you really nothing that's going to help you grind. Vehicle cargo literally blows me away. Never have I felt so ripped off in a video game making on average 75k profit selling‚Ä¶ a supercar that markets for close to 3 million. I‚Äôm sorry. What? And what you have to go through to source a car with NPC‚Äôs left, right and helicopters shooting and crashing into you to make sure the repair costs rack up.

You‚Äôll have a similar story doing VIP work. I find it so dumb. That the only thing worth doing in all that is cocaine and that accounts for a small margin of what else you can do. And their payouts literally are not worth the cost.

So thankfully I saw right through those shark cards and never bought one. Infact I‚Äôm proud I never gave Rockstar that satisfaction. For the sake of GTA6 and the future of GTA Online I have to give this a negative review. This turn the Gaming Industry has taken the past few years is just depressing. It's definitely not what it used to be. But hell Rockstar may never read this or even consider a thing if they did cause it's all about profit and statistics now. Guess I‚Äôve made my point.

One of the best games I've ever played.

The storymode is great. Lots of unique dialogue, interactions etc. Very good.

The Online mode has tons of incredible, hilarious, rage inducing moments.

Lots of trolls, greifers that act like they're 8 years old(some actually are)

Modders are a thing, usually trolls. Though there are some nice modders that will spawn vehicles/ create adventures / drop money for us get rich quick and blow cash on some expensive goodies!

All in all its a great experience.

This review is going to focus toward GTA Online. If your purchasing this game for the single player experience, then I can assure you that it'll be quite fun and immersive. Along with modding, and the FiveM application, you'll be in for a great time. Though, for now lets get into the review.

I've can say that I'm more then qualified to give a proper review for GTA Online, which for most people can become the REAL reason they are grabbing this game. Right from the start, I can easily say that GTA Online is a great and overall fun to experience. There is a lot to do, in almost any department... if your playing with friends. With friends, the PvE of this game can be amazing. A very massive variety of missions, heists, racing, and freemode content. Working to gain more level, unlock weapons and cars, earning money and investing it on whatever you please. It can be quite the grind, I will advise that right now, but if your with buddies, it can be great and worth the time. This game does have some P2W elements, but this can be easily voided with some dedication.

As for a solo player... I would advise you to look pass the game and find something else. GTA Online can be quite dull, and boring for the solo player. Most missions require multiple people, and will pair you with random players. While this might sound good... it has negatives. Some missions require multiple people, players leaving during heists can result in the game ending immediately, which gets very, very frustrating. Freemode activities, such as businesses or organizations require multiple people as well. You CAN do it alone... but there is no fun in doing such.


The PvP side of this game is at the most possible, worst state it's ever been in. Any new player coming into the game is going to get curve stomped into the ground due to level advantage, and lack of equipment. Even for players that are fully equipped, such as myself, the game's PvP is still a mess. Meta vehicles such as the Oppressor MK1 and MK2 flood online, along with meta weapons such as the explosive sniper and shotgun. Tryhards exist in this game, if you thought that they were horrible in other games, you've seen nothing until you play GTA Online. There almost so much more things I can ramble on about as well in terms of the game's PvP, but I'm going to cut it short, cause this review is getting a bit long. GTA Online PvP is a horrible, degrading steaming mess that I advise you not to touch with a ten feet pole.

Modders also plague GTA Online. In almost every single session I've joined in the past few weeks and months, there seems to be a hacker with in every single one. I won't go into depth what they are capable of, but I can say it's quite bad.

Final words? GTA Online is great, if you avoid PvP and play with friends in private sessions. Playing alone, your not going to have a lot of fun with the game. I've played since 2013, and there is so much I can say that they've done to this game for better and worse. The choice is yours, but my overall opinion on the game is to avoid it unless your going for role playing and modding on FiveM, or single player.

Do you want an online gaming experience where you have to either grind for months or spend real money to have enough in-game cash for the car, house, or even the gun you want?

Do you want an online gaming experience where the entire playerbase only exists to prevent you from grinding effectively?

Do you want an online gaming experience full of hackers who will randomly and illegally give you and everyone else free money just because they can?

Do you want an online gaming experience where paranoia over said hackers causes the devs to randomly and without warning "adjust" (read: steal) millions of dollars out of your in-game account, even if you earned it legitimately or bought it directly from them?

Do you want an online gaming experience where confronting the devs on their forums about this leads to them blocking your account and banning you from the servers?

Of course not, because you're not a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• moron.

Stay away from this mess.



EDIT: Okay so I feel like there's been a bit of confusion over what exactly happened, so let me describe the situation to the best of my abilities.

I had 6 million dollars. I didn't buy a shark card. I didn't hack. I didn't exploit. I grinded for several hours using the methlab to get 6 million dollars legitimately. I was going for 10 million so I could buy a yacht. Stupid investment, I know, but I really wanted that damn boat.

And I woke up one morning, and got a message that said that Rockstar noticed an "anomalous cashflow pattern" in my account, and they had "adjusted it accordingly" All my money, except for about $2000, was gone.

I got in contact with a customer service rep on the forums, and she informed me that the server reported that I was earning way too much money way too quickly to be playing legitimately, and told me that if I wanted my money back, I should just buy a shark card. She refused to give me back my money, refused to transfer me to a superior, and warned me that if I didn't drop the issue, I would be banned for cheating.

Admittedly, at this point I started testing her, so she left the chat, and when I tried to contact another customer service rep, I was unable to, because, as expected, I was permanently banned from the Rockstar forums. I also received a 2-month ban from GTA Online.

I know the singleplayer's good. I know the game is polished, and I know that I'm not the best player out there. This isn't about any of that. This is about a large game company using microtransactions to effectively hold hours worth of hard work for ransom.

Rockstar has gone down the path of EA and Ubisoft in how much they treat their customers like dirt, and I don't want to just stand by and watch helplessly. I know this review isn't going to do anything, but it's better than doing nothing.

Rockstar doesn't deserve people's money with how greedy and negligent they've become.
They won't fix a single issue when it comes to having malicious players that will harass and use hacks, but are more than happy to shove their shark cards in your face and now they even have the balls to release a paid subscription option for GTA Online. I'm done supporting this trash company.

Well it is finally here and they were not lying when they said the were optimising it. THEY OPTIMISED IT GREAT! Even if your PC meets minium requirements you can still run the game at 45-50 maybe 60 FPS.

Just a few years ago all the cheater's capabilities was spawning UFOs, changing weather, caging every player in session and other "non-harmful" annoying stuff. But today I've met cheater chasing me across private sessions and even solo heist.
It's getting worse and worse with cheaters situation in GTA Online and Rockstar did nothing useful to fix it. There's known information about cheaters extracting your IP via game for DDoS attacks and even finding your location.
This ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is not fun anymore, it's straight up terrifying and dangerous.
GTA Online has to be abandoned and never be played again. I personally don't want to launch it ever again.

Oh, the Story Mode (singleplayer) of this game is cool. Worth buying



*Review update*

I think I should mention few thing:
Yes, Online is fun and interesting
Yes, it's very unlikely that you meet a cheater chasing you, extracting your location, overheating your computer or blaming you in cheating which will lead to your account banning
Yes, if there was no such dangerous cheaters in Online, I would definitely recommend buying and playing it

But your luck may end one day and you will meet a cheater making something from above to you. Before buying the game or playing Online part of it ‚Äî just be aware of what can happen, don't let it be a surprise for you

Banned twice from modders griefing players. They could warp into your apartment and spam cash on top of you. Even after submiting tickets right after it happened WITH video proof attached to the ticket proving there was nothing I could do, my ticket was closed with out explanation and I was banned. I also wasn not allowed to submit another ticket even WITH PROOF that I was griefed by the hackers.

They completely failed to protect the PC player based and banned thousands of legitimate players with no real way to appeal. Even if you did get through, they don't care about proof or facts. Worst customer service and support EVER. Never give rockstar another dime, beacuse they will just ban right you after you do.

The singleplayer mode will give you a well built, fun experience. Fun as a discount purchase.

Online mode probably was just as good on release, but nowadays it's a toxic dumpsterfire where you'll have difficulties joining sessions, returning from missions, literally anything non-vanilla costs so much that you'll need to grind the game for hundreds of hours to get it, and they have made it incredibly easy to be a griefer to discourage players from grinding and buy shark cards instead to get the fun cars or planes they want.

And lets not even get started on how the game is infested with malicious modders, cheaters and exploiters. There literally exist players that will use a hack tool to crash your game, kick you from the session or even rip your IP and ddos it if they feel like it.

Don't buy it for online. In fact, you probably will never, ever actually want to see the state where Rockstar has let it fall through neglect, incompetence and greed. It looks tasty on the surface but this cake is wet sewage underneath the chocolate crisp and fluffy whipped cream.

Rockstar,

As I'm sure you know, a huge ban-wave occured on the morning of June 25th around midnight. I and many other players who claim to have never cheated/modded have been affected, the common link being that we have had money/levels dropped on our accounts in modded lobbies. You said that players who had this issue would not get banned. What happened?
You are not allowing for appeals. You are automatically closing our tickets. You are banning us for a month. You are wiping our characters. Many of us have had these characters for four years.

What happened to this, Rockstar? https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201617423-Update-on-GTA-Online-Cheaters-and-Modded-GTA-

Given all of the issues rockstar has had lately, I am surprisingly say ing that I would NOT reccomend this game to anyone, and I cannot explain how saddening that is.

So, there you all go. I've never left a review, but had to in this case. Hopefully answers come soon.

Steam says I have 352 hours on GTAV/GTAO. Considering I ported my character over from Xbox 360, it should be at least double that.


So lets say 700 hours.

I have spent aproximately 700 hours playing this video game.

Yet I cannot recommend it.

Yes I have had some of the best gaming I've ever had with this game. I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign, I played online mostly and had a a character legitimately over level 100 and with a nice sum of money set aside. I even supported the game further with the very occasional shark card. I was there for the DNS glitch that caused 9 billion dollar bounties to occur, and I was there when they cut literally everyone's funds to 500,000 as a "fix"

But one day I was playing and some guy joins the server, forcibly teleports myself and a handful of others to him, freezes us, and makes bags of money rain from the sky.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not stupid, I know people hack and people give out money. I've seen countless people ask for them and praise them etc. I've generally ignored them, but this guy didn't give me much of a choice.

Regardless once I figured out what was happening I left the server. I didn't want the money in my bank so I blew it customizing street cars and blowing them up.

A couple hours later I was temporarily banned and my character was reset. I lost all of my cars, including old ones with rare paint jobs that could only be obtained by an exploit that had been patched, not to mention the majority of that 700 hours I'd put into having a character I liked.

Rockstar punished me for something that was thrust upon me. My ingame wallet was raped and they decided to blame the victim.

There was no way for me to voice my displeasure to Rockstar. No appeals process for them to hear my case, check the evidence, and see my innocence.

That was several months ago. I uninstalled the game and let it go.

I'm only writing this now so that others can see what they're getting into.

Yes, as I've said, this game is incredibly fun and contains hours upon hours of content. From an objective standpoint, its very good value for money and the free, regular, DLC is a nice touch.

What ruins all of that is the way Rockstar treats its customers. There's no consistency, and no compassion. I know people in real life that have been taking free money for ages and they've never had any trouble. Yet it happens to me once, without my consent, and I get temp banned and lose literally everything.

What motivation is there to play legitimately then? If people who do can lose everything in an instant with no way to appeal the decision, and those who don't can get away with it indefinitely.

Hell you actually get a bonus for playing illegitimately because those people can just make new accounts and hack their way back to wealth and experience.

Rockstar, if you actually end up reading this, please start treating your customers with some compassion. Don't assume we're all hackers.

TL;Dr Microtransaction Paywalls prohibit any reasonable access to the game. Some items in the game are priced higher than the game it self if you look at Shark Card prices for reference. seems to be the only thing Rockstar enforces aside from spammed reports from players on griefers is Permabanning anyone that attempts to get around their ridiculous pay walls to "Free Updates"


Heres the deal, this game is fun, its funny, well made, the reason I DO NOT RECOMMEND is because of the detestable microtransactions. For example, this game was on sale for $29.99 at the time I write this. The new update that adds "The Ultimate Heist" adds a Delorean that flies and shoots rockets and what not. In the scale of shark cards. that single vehicle is worth $50 sitting at 4mil GTA$ while an 8mil shark card costs $100 usually. throw in the fact you have to buy a "Facility" before you can even buy the car, add 1.6-4.5mil on top of the value depending on what you choose in the way of "Facilities". Congratulations, that SINGLE vehicle in the game now costs about $70. MORE THAN THE PRICE OF THIS GAME WHEN IT WAS BRAND NEW! lets add to that fact with the "Gunrunners update" going as cheaply as we can just to get started. spend about 1.2 mil on the bunker, no upgrades. spend another 1.2mil on the "Mobile Operations Center" which is what actually makes the cool features of the bunker functional. OH ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•! BUT WAIT! to even buy one of these bunkers or facilities, you need an Office, a Motorcycle club, etc. Something that lets you actually own any of the money making businesses. so the Delorean actually costs closer to 80-90 bucks, I digress, To get even the first bit of the cool stuff in any of these "Free Updates" you have to A.) Grind for days. (I've made about 1.5Mil in the past week, with three businesses and a basic bunker, supplemented with a ton of the 2x Rp 2x $ Motor Wars game mode) or B.) Spend easily 450 dollars to get the rest of the content in the game supplemented by weeks of grinding for the smaller stuff. OR C.) Find a hacker to give you money, which brings me to my last point

Rockstar doesn't ban anyone for anything, even hackers, UNLESS THEY BYPASS THEIR MICROTRANSACTIONS! I know a lot of those old reviews say "Hurr Durr I got banned for this" thats probably because they were being a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to every one in the game and got reported a dozen times a day for griefing, OR they didn't mention a hacker just gave them like 25 mil and they started spending it really quickly. that triggers a autoban system from what I can tell.

Im done with rockstar until they make it reasonable or enjoyable to play their game. I like a challenge and earning items in a game, but my 103 hours in GTA Online has yielded 11.4mil about $135 worth of in game currency. Tonight I met a hacker. and in the span of 10 minutes bumped my balance to 126 mil($1350ish in shark cards). I didn't even do anything with it. Got signed out of my account and now I can't log in. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you Rockstar. I didn't even ask for the damn money.

Firstly, I have never written a public game review in 32 years of life. But for this I make an exception ;)

You're probably wondering to yourself. How does one of the highest grossing games of all time get mixed customer reviews on steam despite the PC edition coming out 3 years after the console version? You might be wondering if they care about your custom, or if some decrepit fat cat just wants your money so they can go retire on a mulitmillion $ yacht someplace and not give a damn. Well, I'm not sure I can answer all those concerns, but I'll try my best.

->Fan since 1997 (21 years).
->Buy pretty much every GTA for full price including pre-ordering. Buy GTA 5 twice, once console, 5 years later PC.
->Did not allow me to transfer my console 110 rank character. Ok fine, doesn't make sense, but okay... I roll with it...
->They randomly erase legit [no cheat, no glitch, no mod money] PC character (300+ rank, effectively 410+ rank if you add my console character) after 1200 hours of brutally accurate grinding and rare achievement accomplishment (1/500 players) and false ban, NO REASON GIVEN. Meanwhile sessions constantly filled with cheaters at every turn. Real cheaters on forums pointing out they have never been banned...
->People who money glitched and accepted Mod money never banned. FACT!
->Terribly glitchy and lazy development, recycled missions, interface glitches, game crashes, unstable sessions, infinite loads
->Zero customer service and support, pointlessly outsourced to clueless external company that copy and pastes answers where you can communicate with their uneducated, low paid slave goons.
->I spent hundreds of hours teaching noobs to play. Literally, 3 minute missions can sometimes take one hour or more due to disconnects and noobs (and pronoobs).
-If you don't have many friends online, expect to wait for hours to fill up your game lobby sometimes, and await your impending character erasure.
->Never once used passive mode, and cannot remember ever destroying someone's product (why should I?).

Legit, honest, pro players are collateral damage. One of my worst gaming experiences in about 3 decades of gaming? A game built for noobs and suckers to spend real money on microtransactions and wreck the missions of good and honest players. But games are not banks to me, they're entertainment and challenge. Oops!

But if that wasn't enough. The game will have you scratching your head with waste of time philosophical questions such as: How do you NOT accidentally glitch in a glitchy piece of garbage with cheaters running around every corner? (Oh wait! $2000 for good behaviour in a crime game, yey! WT*?)

Don't let yourself be caught in the cycle of addiction. Let this 5 year old dinosaur of a game run it's course and lay to rest. Forget about it. This game is not worth it. Your life is worth more than this. Maybe pick this game up from the trashheap some time, but sure as hell don't fill their pockets with ¬£50 full price just so u can be thrown into a glitchy mess that is designed to try to squeeze money out of you like water from a rock. Go support a worthy company instead. Indie developers probably put in 10 times the quality control of these guys.

Fan mode deactivated.
Boycott mode activated.
I refuse to be a victim to a trash, egotistical video game company that is supposed to be producing entertainment.
(Next "infraction" for nothing [NO EXPLANATIONS, R* PRETEND THEY'RE INFALLIBLE] is permaban? How about I boycott all your products instead? *Insert obscenities here*)
Remember: It could have been you!

Enough wasting time on this.

Thanks for breaking the 2 decade old delusion. But to be honest, this false ban saved me from an insane addiction!

Regards,
Your former biggest fan that has supported your disgrace of a game since it's 1997 inception.

PS: why does Grand Theft Auto 5 involve BUYING CARS? Hmm... alrighty then... I rest my case.

First of all...
ROCKSTAR IS NOT BANNING FOR SINGLE PLAYER MODS. They've now stated this outright. I mean seriously, when did we start believing people who were banned, just because they say they're innocent? 90% of these new negative reviews are unfounded and outright lies. Not only that, but they have no changed the EULA, either. If you have a DLL injector installed in your game directory, it DOESN'T MAGICALLY STOP WORKING WHEN YOU GO ONLINE. Just because you don't use it, it's STILL there. YOUR OWN FAULT.

Like seriously, when did people get dumb enough to think an anti cheat wouldn't pick up DLL INJECTORS? DLL INJECTORS ARE THE MOST COMMON WAY HACKS EXIST. *headdesks* There are two groups of people - actual cheaters, who got banned from online for cheating using the scripthook and trainer (dll injection), and then there's people who only used it in single player but left it installed when they went online. Newsflash - it's still there, it's still injected into the games memory.

In any case, the game is great. There's a few speed bumps and quirks here and there that need to be worked out, as with any game so soon after launch, but overall it performs great, online is fun, and you can mod single player. Not really a lot more you can ask for, amirite?

9/10, because I don't believe in perfect scores.

P.S. Stop being idiots.

Edit: In light of a few ignorant jackasses, here's the proof:
http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire
‚ÄúI‚Äôm having soo much fun with GTAV on the PC but I just have one question about it, how come you are not allowing mods for it?‚Äù - @ClarkMatthew63
‚ÄúWill I get banned from GTA Online for using a FoV Mod or Oculus Rift mod?‚Äù - @Mattophobia

We have always appreciated the creative efforts of the PC modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original GTA map mod for GTAIV PC among many other classics. To be clear, the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for GTAIV. Recent updates to GTAV PC had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications. This was not intentional, no one has been banned for using single player modifications, and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways.

But by all means - let's just believe the banned people because they said "they didn't do it". It's not like cheaters to lie about it or anything.

Some random modder started dropping money on me and after like 2 minutes I got banned for 30 days and my character that I played on for 500h deleted. The fun part is that I can't even appeal ban because I just get a response from bot. Good job Rockstar.

This game was initially released 7 years ago, SEVEN YEARS AGO. and not only does it have thousands of concurrent players daily, it is still selling by the millions TO THIS DAY.

Say what you will about Rockstar and their sh*tty practices, but you can't deny the fact that they knew what they were doing when they made GTA V.

Your account has been suspended to 28.2.2017
In addition, your GTA Online character will be reset.

Thank you R*, your support is overwelming.

This ban has been issued with no reason, its just there, after I done a CEO Cargo sell mission.
Yeah ban legit players but keep the modders mod. Nice job R*. How to waste 100 hours and 30‚Ç¨ for this stupid game without an anti-cheat.

Do not support a company that doesn't support its community.
(It's not Rockstar's fault, but Take-Two).

Mod content is what have made me play it for a long time. Even it had the biggest map in GTA games, I felt the single player campaign was the shortest one in entire series.

Multiplayer was fun but had a flaw, like any other MP game: cheaters. But that existed even before OpenIV had support for GTA V, and will continue to happen after this bombshell. They have should spent less with lawyers and more with developers to enhance the anti-cheat system, even talk with OpenIV team to verify that info and work with them with some solution, if that was really true.

But now it's done, there is no way back. If I feel the urge to do some killing spree, I know where I can find it: on good ol' Playstation 2 San Andreas, in Carl Johnson hands.

This is the support ticket I sent to Rockstar:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

epicfourthwall

Jul 2, 16:12 EDT

I launched the game, played the tutorial and then played with a friend and then quit. Got back on, joined my friends clan while trying to kill my him and then I fell off some rocks to be killed by a car. Not even given a chance to respawn -- I was told that I was banned until August 1st.

Total Play Time: 2 hours

I feel as though I have been cheated, because I don't believe that playing your game is deserving of a suspension. If there were modders in my game, I don't think banning randoms helps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I bought this game to play with my friends, and although playing offline is an option - this ban has ruined my view of the game and I will not be playing nor recommending it.

Multiplayer in this game is fundamentally broken due to cheaters, modders, and stupid updates
Completly no balance with new vehicles, wanna fly a motorcycle with rockets? Sure there you go, Oppresor MK2 best vehicle for griefers/cheaters Completely destroys balance in all vehicles, no point of using combat jets when you can be shot down by fu**ing flying motorcycle. Devs cant nerf it after 2 years of continually complaining from community. Guess why? Almost most expensive vehicle in the game, so that means more money from micro-payments...
Weapon balance is a joke, explosive sniper ammo? Of course there it is! Here you go cheater, you can take it as well.
One of the worst community I've seen in a video game.
Most playable session are only when you make them private with friends thanks to little trick/glitch, due to cheaters that can literally crash your game, crash your session, black screen you (so that means endless loading), interfere with your mission on session like: cancel them, bug them, despawn your vehicle... even modify your character data, delete your cars, delete your money, explode you anytime and everywhere, spawn police on you, spawn cars on you, kill you, drunk you, knock you out, change your player apperance model.
Fly though textures with god mode? No problem. Auto-kill switch for you? No problem.
Multiplayer is totally mess and i feel like Anticheat doesnt exist no more.
Rockstar should be sued for unplayable multiplayer expierence, so many problems, hard to point them at once, but truth is other players are ruining this game for average player, and rockstar is pretending there is no problem at all.
Hard to belive same studio created Red Dead Redemption 2 so diffrent quality games...

Hey guys, I don't usually write reviews, but Grand Theft Auto V is a game that is absolutely worth it.

A game that breaked most impressive records of Guiness Book:



Best-selling action-adventure video game in 24 hours (12 milion copies)
Best-selling video game in 24 hours (564 milion$)
Fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion
Fastest video game to gross $1 billion
Highest-grossing video game in 24 hours
Highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours (including Hollywood movies)
Most viewed trailer for an action-adventure video game
Most viewed trailer of an action-adventure video-game (800+ milion views)



Graphics

1. Graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible. The game runs smooth on any kind of GPU's and CPU's as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements. By the way, these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details.

2. Graphic details are the best I have seen, especially in an open-world game. If I was to tell you all about this topic, I would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours, because boy there are lots to talk about. I'm just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me.

a) Day/Night cycle recreation. Sure this is not something new in its essence, it has been done before and not just in GTA, but the way we see it here it's what's amazing. The way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it's off the charts. You don't even realize when the afternoon becomes evening. The only way you can tell, it's that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you.

b) Rain. Again, not a new feature, actually is quite an old one BUT the way it's been reproduced in GTAV ... You can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact. Apart from the obvious, what makes rain so special in GTAV ? Well, THE SOUND. This is something that not many people talk about, yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game.The way Rockstar Games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain (besides everything else).

c) Night time, baby! Sure we had night in GTA IV and even before that, so why do I mention this ? Well, because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows. I am not talking just about the graphics aspect. What I'm saying is that the night in GTAV gives you the impression of actual liveliness; the whole city comes to life. It's just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever.

3. Cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we've seen in previous GTA's. I'm not talking about a direct comparison, because of the obvious reason (2015-2010) but what I'm trying to say is that I personally wasn't that impressed at the time by the cars/helis/planes in GTA4 as I am now in GTAV.

Gameplay and Features

Oh yea, the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for GTAV to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come.

1. Car Control I feel like thanking Rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter. Car control was preety much garbage in GTA IV and for this reason alone I had no big expectations for this new series. Well, I was wrong. The car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing NFS MW back in the day. Besides the control, there is the sound of the car's engine which is perfectly accurate.

2. Randomness. Now what in God's name I'm talking about?! Well, have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help ? A woman's that was about to get raped, a kid who's bike was stolen, hitchhiker asking you to take her/him home, etc usually for a reward. If you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal, but baby, this stuff gives GTAV a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game.

3. Los Santos Customs. Again, not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special. Have you tried modifying the car's suspension? Of course you did, what am I saying! But have you actually paid attention of it's realism AFTER the change was made? Well, for those who haven't and for the one's who dont own the game yet, let me tell you that this feature is game-making. My favorite car in GTAV is the Grotti Carbonizzare also known as the Ferarri F12. Now think, how am I gonna drive that beast on the city's roads? Especially in areas like Groove, Hilwood, Rockford. These are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads, so you cant really drive a Ferarri in these parts of the town. Well, you can. Modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn't just make for visual effects, but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads, turns, hard turns. BTW, if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn, you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings. For me, this is one of the best things I've seen in this game.

4. Activities. Driving, mission making, robberies, flying, hunting, diving, piloting aircrafts, submarines, boats, golf, tennis, cards, smoke weed, racing, playing the stock market. You will never get bored in this game, not even in Single Player mode.

There are so many more things to talk about, but the review would be monstruosly long, so In a few words: buy the game, it will be the best investment you have done in a PC game. For those who thaught the review was too long and skipped to the bottom, I can tell you in short, that this game excels in every aspect:: Weapons look so realistic in First Person mode, cars have a mind blowing realistic control, weather has never been better reproduced, etc. GL&HF

So I am another player who played legitimately for 650+ hours and got banned. I got back into the game for 3 weeks, and 2 of these weeks were Double Money weeks for MC businesses. I bought my MC businesses, which brought me down to around 2 million. And within these 2 weeks and help with friends, I got up to 48.8 mil. And that was after I bought probably around an additional 7 million worth of stuff (Deluxo and Oppressor) during those two weeks. Felt pretty good. All legit with just watching the in-game TV and selling my businesses' products when they were full. My father and I play this game together and he's well over 200 mil (1200+ hours), all legit because of this method. Based on how much the community hates Rockstar, I'm pretty sure he was one of the last players to actually support this company. Until of course, his daughter got banned.

So those 150-200ish hours from these past 2 weeks are wasted. My character will be reset after a 30 day ban. At first we had faith that Rockstar Support would lift the faulty ban as they did when the March 2018 ban wave hit hundreds of innocents. But no. Rockstar Support is such a joke. Submit a ticket about appealing a ban, and it gets closed immediately with a message from a bot. Submit a ticket about a "game issue" takes me to live chat support, who I have spoken to for 3 hours now. Basically just keeps giving me copy-and-paste messages that claims all these false facts like "their ban systems are perfect" (refer to March 2018 ban wave, refer to "GTA VI coming in 2019" goof, etc.). When you call Rockstar over the phone, they are all mindless robots and speak off of a script the same exact copy-and-paste messages. The customer service is awful and Rockstar will hit Rockbottom and no one but the braindead 12 year olds and manchildren will be there to support them.

Rockstar never really had experience in multiplayer games anyway. GTA Online shows this with their customer service and also just how the game works in general. Loading screens typically take forever, as I can have two diarrhea attacks before I load into a game. GTA Online was actually fun, but late-game turns into Delivery Guy Simulator if you want to optimize your grind. But I just got to that point where I have enough money where I could grind and have fun without feeling like I'm losing money from not optimizing my grind enough. But I will say that GTA Online was fun before all my progress was reset for playing the game legit. If you want some fun where your progress is NOT guaranteed to be saved even if you follow the rules and do everything right, then yeah buy the game. But don't buy Shark Cards, like ever. Really. Criminal Enterprise is cool maybe but never ever Shark Cards.

But if you wanna play for the story, that's cool too. But wait for it to go on sale, story ain't worth the full price.

Rant time!

TLDR: You can get banned at random without any chance of appeal, and Rockstar's support is garbage.

But now, backstory time! On about 3/23/18 thousands of accounts were randomly banned. I'm not saying all of them were innocent, but at least a vocal majority certainly are. And as of writing this, (4/5/18) we still haven't gotten any sort of proper response, that isn't some generic copy-paste nonsence.

This new system appears to have been targeting cheaters, but happens to label seeming randomly people as cheaters.
But you wanna know what will likely come of wiping the progress of some thousand people's charaters? More cheaters. Because, who realisticly is going to come back after a month, having lost some hundreds -in some case thousands- of hours, of legit grinding thinking "well, let's do that ALL over again."

And don't even get me started on their support policies. If you even MENTION the word "ban," your support ticket is thrown directly into the trash, and given a generic "bans are triggered by a number of things..." "and all bans are final." Like, they give this anti-cheat so much credit that "It can do no wrong" in their eyes. And you're placing a losing bet if you think they will admit any sort of failure on their end.

On top of all this, IF you somehow get a real responce from someone, they can't/won't tell you why you were even banned. This is just plain stupid on many levels. You're just, SUPPOSTED to know what you did wrong and not do it again.
This is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Especially when one of the listed reasons for a ban is "Disrupting play." That's so incredibly vague, they could ban you for just about anything under that label.

If they're banning for minor exploits/glitches, they have a lot longer list than what was banned. I guerentee at least a third of the community has exploited some glitch one time or another. And if that is so, that's some pretty backwards priorities when you STILL can't go a few hours in freeroam without bumping into a cheater.

That's all I have to say. I know the general consensus on steam is/was, "lmao, cheaters BTFO." But I still felt the need to get my thoughts out there. And if Rockstar plans to treat their players in RedDead2 with the same respect they do GTAO players, they can just piss off.

Disclaimer: Yes, I was one of those affected. No I've never used any sort of mod, single or multiplayer. I've never sought after any sort of modded money or xp. And yes, I have used minor, non-malicious glitches in the past.

"Highest grossing media title of all time"

How can you possibly be proud of yourselves with that, what with turning your back on the community, shutting down singleplayer modding, stretching the online experience to a horrendous paced grind and ignoring to patch botched combat gameplay?

This game is the aids of micro-transactions. They wonder why everyone mods, why would anyone pay $100 for 8 million GTA dollars that can buy you only like 2-3 vehicles, when you could pay for a mod menu that costs $15-$20 and do whatever the hell you want?

Lets say you drop $5 to get the 200,000 GTA dollars or even $10 on half a mil. What in the hell are you going to buy with that? Literally nothing is at that low of a price point in this game. This game's economy is so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up that Rockstar unintentionally created a whole 3rd party market outside of their's for people to sell modded accounts. If you join a lobby literally 3/4ths of the players are modding/modded. This wouldn't have happened if Rockstar wasn't so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• stingy.

I am unable to access GTA online. Why is there a problem? Could you please look into this issue for me.
Agent:[8/30/18 1:15:16 AM]
One moment while we connect you.
Agent:[8/30/18 1:17:06 AM]
Hello, my name is Ben. Thank you for contacting Rockstar Support. I see you are contacting us about being unable to access GTAO on the PC. I took a look into your account and it appears that it has been permanently banned from GTAO, and as all ban decisions are final and cannot be appealed, we are unable to provide any assistance on the Ban. But if you have any other technical issues, we would be more then glad to help you with it
FaceHuggerFreddi:[8/30/18 1:17:41 AM]
Could you please explain why I was banned?
Agent:[8/30/18 1:18:44 AM]
I'm afraid that the only information we are able to provide to players regarding bans is their suspension status, which in your case is that of a Permanent Ban. Is there anything else we can assist you with instead ?
FaceHuggerFreddi:[8/30/18 1:19:26 AM]
Are you a live human being or a bot?
FaceHuggerFreddi:[8/30/18 1:20:22 AM]

FaceHuggerFreddi:[8/30/18 1:20:43 AM]
Hello?
Agent:[8/30/18 1:21:19 AM]
I'm a human. However, do you have any other technical issues we can help you with ? if not we will have to end this chat
FaceHuggerFreddi:[8/30/18 1:21:54 AM]
I will be boycotting red dead and gta 6
Agent:[8/30/18 1:22:23 AM]
As it looks like you do not have any other technical issues we can assist you with, we will be ending this chat. Thank you for contacting Rockstar Support and have a great day. Should there be any other technical issues, feel free to contact us again.

Okay so, after having put in some nearly 600 hours in the game I feel its time to make a review.

Graphics wise on PC, the game is pretty solid if you have the hardware required. You can see it wasn't just a straight port from consoles. The attention to detail in sounds, dialogs and everything is quite astonishing! The singleplayer story is interesting, though some characters mainly Trevor just feel kind of... forced. That is excuseable however since everything is in order and with quite some polishing put into it. There's plenty to do singleplayer wise, altough until now there is no word as to singleplayer DLC's like the episodic DLC's for GTA IV.

The bad thing when it comes to singleplayer is mods. Not too long ago, the developers decided that modding this game is bad, and that you should feel bad if you mod it, pretty much killing the entire modding comunity from day to night. That has generate some huge backlash (take a look at other reviews).

Now let's get to the rotten core of this review, the multiplayer aspect of the game. Now, you have to understand, when the game was just released on PC, the first week of online play was quite nice, barring server issues but even those weren't that much of a problem and most of the issues started to rise later on and most of them are still very much unadressed up until now.

The first big issue is the amount of hackers in game. It was worse, but it's still quite bad. Often times you will find yourself in a lobby where you get exploded out of nowhere. Or have an UFO and other things spawned on top of your head pretty much preventing you from doing anything. You may also find that the streets and roads have turned to quick sand meaning you'll end up driving a few feet and your car will get dragged back to the starting point over and over and over again. That won't happen if you're on foot though. Shortly after you will get sniped by someone on the other side of the map as they also simultaneously snipe everyone else. You will also occasionaly be teleported to other places or face people with machine guns that are fed with rocket belts.

Other than the issues mentioned above with hackers, the main issue is hackers dropping tons of money out of the sky on top of you, most of the time also preventing you from avoiding these pickups and turning you into a millionaire by accident. On any other world this would be a good thing but it is not in GTA Online, as Rockstar has been known to occasionally ban players who receive hacked money. They don't really seem to worry much about you getting hacked XP points though, or so the community has pointed out. As of the latest hacked money wipe a lot of people who earned quite a few bucks legitimately with the double money events also had their legitimate gains wiped out with the Smuggler's run update that added hangars and a variety of helicopters and planes.

Speaking of the online DLC, here's the really crippling issue, that seems to outweight the bugs, hackers and everything else with online. While the online aspect of the game is free to play and you can build your own fortune from the ground up, there are "soft pay walls" that will likely lock you out of the DLC content in online as it is quite frankly, extremely expensive. The most recent DLCs, Smuggler's Run and Gun Running are a very good example of one such thing, with most of the content requiring a few millions for you to purchase a hangar and the vehicles you want. If you happen to want cold war era bomber tough luck because it will cost you over 5 millions to buy it, + a few more depending on the hangar of your choice.

With the gun running DLC, it's the same issue. You will need to buy a bunker in order to research the upgrades for your vehicles. Want an APC with missile launchers? You'll have to buy the bunker then research it. But here's the thing, you CANNOT choose the type of research to perform so if you're unlucky, it'll be the last thing on your list. Of course you can boost these research projects at a cost of about 220,000 each, and if you boost them all it'll cost you a whopping 11 millions in online currency. Then you will also need to buy a mobile command center WITH a vehicle workshop and then buy the APC, and then spend the money to add the missile turret to it. Oh, and it doesn't lock on aircraft.

Now you may be thinking that making a few millions in this game isn't so bad... Well... it is. It really is. When you think about a tough grind, you might think of World of Tanks and it is quite a grind indeed, but it's not as bad as GTA Online's. The regular jobs you get from contacts... Sure, do them so you can get a good amount of RP, but don't trust them to net you any significant amount of money. Heists can be interesting if you're the leader, where you'll take most of the payday after the heist finale. But they're much harder and it is very difficult to find a team that will not troll you, will not act as idiots and will not generally just give you a VERY bad time.

There are other options such as exporting cars once you buy the car garage, but don't exepct it to be as easy since you have to source the car, pay for the repair on it if it gets damaged, then pay for the mods if you want to sell it at a high value and then whatever damage it sustains from your warehouse to the delivery point, comes out of your commission. Oh, and expect plenty of military helicopters and jets to try and succesfully bomb your while you're delivering the car, causing you to lose money on it.

You can get around this grind if you can shell out money for the shark cards. The ones that give you any real amount of money that you'd be able to actually spend on things you might like are more expensive than the game itself. And with each online DLC, odds are you'd need AT LEAST 2 or maybe 3 of that one specific card. One DLC comes to mind where the total amount of vehicles and other assets you could purchase totals in the 33,000,000 for all the content, so unless you plan on making GTA Online your full time job, you will likely not see most of the online content. The exception being if you were lucky enough to be playing it when it was released on the PS3 and Xbox 360 and where around when the "moneypocalypse" happened and you're pretty much an in game billionaire.

And by the way, the online DLC content that comes from time to time, does not get put in the singleplayer portion of the game and you'd only be able to access with mods, which are not okay according to GTA V developers.

Edit - 25/10/2017: As of recently, rockstar has announced there will be no singleplayer DLC for GTA V. Also, corrected some bad spelling and non-sensical sentences in this review.

TL;DR The singleplayer portion of the game isn't bad, but don't expect any singleplayer DLC soon. The online portion is riddled with connection problems, hackers, trolls and is somewhat toxic. The DLC content for online does not get put on singleplayer and is safely tucked away behind a soft paywall (which is actually a VERY thick paywall). The only real way to get significant online currency is buying shark cards that are pretty expensive and you'd need several with each DLC to be able to access all the content.

Crossing the street in GTA Online is like walking through Iraq in 2004. You could be driving around, and you'll get orbital cannoned for no reason. Or if you don't like flying bikes and cars that shoot accurate homing missiles, don't get it. Game is filled with griefers and k/d hunters that have nothing to do all life so they shoot down your cargo for no reason. It's filled with connection problems. But if you're buying for the story, the story is amazing. Don't get me wrong, online can be fun too, just, 40% of the time.

I love this game to death but there is one thing I can't ignore.
The anti-cheat system.
So if you still want to get this game I'll leave a few tips for you to avoid getting banned.

-See a cheater, get out of the lobby
-Don't use mods even for single player
-Don't use third party overlays

If I find anymore ways I'll update, anyways I hope this helps anyone looking into the game.

Edit: These are just precuactions even doing these you might not avoid the bans.

tl;dr If you want to be treated like trash and to be accused of fruadulancy, then definetly get this game. If you value your time and sanity, make sure to skip this game

Coming from a last gen console I had legitimatley earned $5million (Heists, missions, sharkcards). I moved to PC to play the new content and get new updates, and along with it I got a $1.25million Sharkcard. I spend some money here and there, and ultimatly I'm left at $3million and I decided to get back on the grind.

One day I join a random lobby after finishing a mission, and the lobby happened to have a hacker who was giving away money, and put $30million into my account. Couldn't do anything about it. I contacted Rockstar Support about this and they basically said "whatever, just keep it". I didnt spend much from it, and put it into my second character so I could go back to trying to be legit.

A couple of updates later, Rockstar removes all of my money. That includes my Sharkcard and my legitmatly earned money. I contacted Rockstar Support again and they said that they found all the money in my account to be fraudulent and removed it all. I tried pursuing it further to get my $20 sharkcard back at least but I was threatened with being banned for "false reports".

Okay, so whatever I'll just sell some cars I don't use, and use the businesses I have to make money again. Come around to the new Smugglers Update, and I have $2million legit from my businesses, ready for whatever boat-motorcycle-plane they have for this update. Keep in mind that I was grinding this money for a good while now and spent a lot of time working for it having to deal with public lobby bs and griefers.

I update the game, and what do you know - Rockstar removed my money again for being "illegitimatley earned".

Now I'm again at $0, with Rockstar Support being Rockstar Bot Support, I have not gotten any responses or any sight of help. In total I spent about $150 on the game (from console and PC with Shakrcards) just to be treated like scum of the earth. I'm done playing the game. Since October of 2013, it's been nothing but grind, grind, grind, just to get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like this.

Oh, and just to salt the wounds, Rockstar is being generous and offering a whooping 15% discount on Sharkcards to those affected.

‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you Rockstar.

So at first R* fails to protect the game from hacking, then they fail to ban cheaters, then they ban innocent players, then they fail to resolve any false bans while not giving any meaningful explanation.

At first I was sceptic about false ban issue but then I got banned too and I have no idea why (supposedly for using Discord?!). Rockstar support refused to remove a ban or to give a reason for a ban. Just a bot reply "All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed". This is the worst support I've ever encountered.

Rockstar cares about one thing and one thing only: making money from Shart cards.

As such, they have utterly refused to fix their game with proper, client-server multiplayer code, instead opting to allow neckbeard scriptkiddies with trainers, aka "modders," to run rampant with R*'s entirely insecure peer-to-peer networking. It's entirely normal to log into a multiplayer session only to have your character blown up inside your own building, set on fire, and locked in a cage. More current trainers, aka, "mod menus," allow for these griefers to attack even you even if you've changed sessions or changed to the single player game. Worse still, these trainers are now capable of launching denial of service attacks and rumored to be able to use your game client as pivot point into your computer.

Make no mistake, if I ever had F-U Money, I'd buy R*, fire all of the top brass and network coders, hire new ones that know their butts from a hole in the ground, and have GTAV rewritten with proper, secure netcode so as to allow for this gorgeous open world game actually be playable.

Until then, Rockstar ought to be held criminally liable for their negligent greed.

Do NOT buy this game, GTA V Online is literally unplayable and is NOT safe. People will buy mod menus that give them your ip address and all your info. Ive been DOX'D , ive been DDOS'D, and I was just recently hacked by some Clown OVER A GAME. R* is a company that makes billions a year and literally has 0 security for the people that play this game... thats just one aspect. Not to mention the game is literally unplayable because of all the 12 year old modders that just blow servers up. you literally cannot find a session without 50% people in godmode modding the hell out of the session. This game is such a mess I really cant believe people still tolerate this from R*. I will never buy another R* game ever... they have become a joke of a company. I would not be surprised if R* sells mod menus on the low. they are a shiesty company now. This game is literally a security risk for you. every time you play there is someone in the session that has every ones IP address and information. All you have to do is a small amount of research to see everything im saying is true and more.

Imagine a Multi Billion dollar company has 0 control over their own game... that's the real joke.

Rockstar robbed me of 650k and won't even tell me how I obtained "illegitimate" money.
Because even I don't know.

All I've been doing ever since I bought the CEO building maybe a couple of months ago has been warehouse missions. Mainly Import / Export after I unlocked it.

Of course I get put into solo public lobbies because my connection is too poor (can't connect to other players nothing to do with router / firewall settings)

Rockstar is just greedy and wants to stir the pot with legit players meanwhile modded players run around with billions still. As well as modded ranks.

Thanks Rockstar, you're trash.

Sometimes, there are planes, sometimes there are boats, sometimes there are cars. But all the time there is a constant fear of having money bags spawned on your head and having Rockstar ban you.

I'm pretty sure that cheater is still playing normally.

Adding to the review, I can no longer mod singleplayer. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• this.

Two years ago I was put in bad player pool by a modder after several weeks of trying to deal with support when they kept closing the unresolved ticket I finally gave up and stopped playing the game. I come back 2 years later to find my account still in bad player pool. I write a new ticket and start getting the same scripted response blaming me and having ticket closed unresolved . This company is disgusting.

Usually I dont do reviews on Steam about games... but Rockstars greed and Rockstars support impotence made me unstoppable to not throw out my feelings... so...

I remember first time GTA V was announced to PC.. I was excited as huge GTA franchise fan! Intrigued that finaly I would not need to dream about PlayStation to play one of best games ever! That was huge... pricy, but huge, loved it anyway - ordered a pre-order with some huge bonuses here in Steam for quite a lot for that time for game! Enjoyed!

First I enjoyed game really much... liked it, loved it, played it a lot... but real life took my attention and GTA V and especially GTA V Online hours reduced till I was legit to say Im not playing it anymore... so few weeks before I write this review I returned and was suprised that there is a lot things to upgrade, purchase and amazing new content - even got new friends, since my old friends was not playing GTA V anymore! Started to understand that it will take few weeks to get some of my mostly desired content... that meant playing MC stuff, selling bunker stuff, researching bunker stuff, playing heists and everything... since my cars was so slow and not top notch (couldnt afford compatable for racing). So far so good ? Yeah... I always was aginst cheating - public looby modders always f**k things up.. bomb you remotely, engage PvP with god mode or etc... simply hated it - till I found community to play with and who usually occupies public lobby and kicks anyone who is just cheating or creating cage around you!

Perfect! My return will be easier in such community - I will need few less weeks to get desired items - some members are rich and lets test me newest cars (my best was Zentorno and Osiris, T20 too) but there wooow Buggati Chiron like car and it cost millions! So community players see that I cannot afford even security on my MC businesses and in some heists they put me in clear advantage since they gave double digit millions in account (I usually didnt have more than 1.5 million in-game cash) and put my reward for heist ridicilusly high (75%)... nice good heist time evenings and luckly selling some bunker stuff and woilaa - got 3.7 millions in-game cash - tought about what to buy and since it was late evening - went to sleep with idea that tomorrow I will choose what of desired content I will buy :) Got really excited about community and game again - fully returning to play it...

Sounds too good ? Yes... today (its evening of the day I wanted to choose what to buy) I recieve email that Ive been bad boy by violationg Terms of Service/EULA and I got suspended for 30 days and all my items will be deleted...

Devasted ? At beginning not really - even tought: "Phe, Ive have done nothing bad, didnt cheat - whatever. It must be error and usually that kind of stuff is repaired and all will be fine"... Ive been heard that there is ban waves where innocent people been banned and tought that Rockstar should be fixing that - so with good willing - made ticket in Rockstar Support about my suspension and warning to delete all achievments Ive been earned so far (some of them, for example my first supercar - Zentorno, more than few years old). Guess what ? They auto-close this kind of ticket... Okay, thought thats a bug - so I got live chat with support and explained what halppened... and first line of support just say he cant help me - there is some factor that is reason for banning me and when asked about what - he was not able to say, just that its violation of ToS/EULA! As experienced customer support guy - I understand first line guys problem and tell - okay - please escalate issue about bug to his supervisor if he really cant help... so amazingly my live chat with support is taken to other guy which is less coming to me back and just closes conversation with same text "I will not tell why you got banned, its not without reason". Im shocked... even angry! I paid at that time 60‚Ç¨ for game...

Devasted! Support should not be so bad but then I started reading reviews and internet about everything and I see a lot complains about banning innocent players, yet I remember how was going in random public lobby - if not blown appart, then caged with some modder... and then me - who hard work in-game cash to get desired car... and now this - my GTA V Online character will be deleted, all my cars will be deleted...

How I feel about it ? Im devasted,,, paid for game and I will be honest - Online part of game is last that Im in there for, since single player I have been 100% completed on XBOX360... and now they take me from me without reason or because their ban bot is failure or mistaken or simply badly coded... I keep asking why Rockstar is doing this ? My only guess would be that 60‚Ç¨ I have paid to them (ofc steam takse some part, so tehnicly a bit less) is not enough or they want more... You would ask how I become to this illuminati theory ? Just keeped asking why ? Ofc I have another steam accounts and by CS:GO items (played that game for more thousands of hours) I can sell - I can easaly earn those 20‚Ç¨ and not be ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about all unfairness of Rockstar here, but Im man with principles and I can publicy tell - NO. Rockstar, I will not pay you more to get content I already paid for long time ago overpriced amount of ‚Ç¨.

What to do next ? Sue Rockstar ? Nah... I readed ToS/EULA and terms I have checked checkbox that I agree and it basicly removes any rights to me to go to court to say that Rockstar is simply abusing me... Forget ? No, Im man of principle. Wait 30 days and start from zero - probably... at this point thats only thing I have left and apparently I will return to game, but probably It will take for me more than 30 days for that - just because my anger about unfair situation is too big but I still love this game, yet I understand that developer company and support is softly saying BAD.

At this point Im really glad that I never bought any shark cards and I will never buy extra copy of GTA V on other accounts to pay extra to Rockstar! Over and dissapointed!

I want to preface this with a note of how sad it makes me to write this, I've played this game with friends since it came out for xbox 360 and have had some really amazing memories while playing. I even bought copies of this game for over 8 of my friends when it came out on PC because of how excited i was to play it on a quality system instead of a console, with that said however, I would never recommend buying a RockStar game of any kind, both GTA Online and Red Dead Redemption Online have become utter and total garbage.

''We are also committed to ensuring that our games are fun for everyone and as safe as possible from modders, cheaters, hackers and those who seek to harass other players''

The above statement from RockStar is a joke at best. RockStar legitimately doesn't care at all about user experience or about being accountable to their promises or offers.

They allow players to mod and hack their game online and do nothing at all to enforce any kind of rules regarding this, however, they will punish players who haven't modded but have gotten cash from modders, whether the player wanted that money or not.They constantly add new game features that are either broken and don't work at all, or just ruin the enjoyment available to game-play (Oppressor Mk2).

Rockstar will also punish players for using so called "in game exploits" that their poor programming and total lack of testing/foresight created yet they refuse to do anything at all to rectify the untenable situation that modders have created in their games, its honestly just pathetic and indicates that their programmers and project managers are either lazy, amateurs or just plain dumb.

They will also constantly advertise bonus cash payouts for their Shark Cards that they literally never pay out, check the RockStar support forums regarding this and you can find countless entries regarding players not being paid out the bonus cash for more than 6 years now.

You are better off buying a copy of Fallout 76, or any EA game even. At least that garbage is better supported and maintained than any RockStar game and speaking frankly I doubt that Rockstar will ever change how they respond to player requests and their game being ruined by the select few who choose to cheat.

RIP RD Online and GTA Online, you were both beautiful ideas that your creators simply saw for cash cows. I pity any of the developers who were passionate about this because their passions have been treated with 0 respect and 0 care.

TL;DR
GTA Online and RD Online are so plagued with hacking, modding and glitchy missions/events they aren't playable. Rockstar gives 0 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. They will lie to you about offers and punish you for complaining or commenting. You are wasting your money if you buy. 0/10

***BUYER BE WARNED***
Offline: 9/10
Online: 2/10

Online is an absolute joke. The servers are full of hackers and cheaters that somehow get away with it for months on end. Yet, I see honest players being banned because your servers are glitching them out! Or better yet, actions caused by other players / hackers are pushing out good, loyal players. It's sad that you're destroying your own customer base. Hopefully you read the reviews, and value our input, but thusfar we have seen nothing implemented to protect the honest players of this community. I would say it has been too little, too late, and you have already lost a vast majority of your population. The only version of this game that is actually enjoyable/playable is the campaign.

First of all if you're looking to buy just for the singleplayer, you're all set it's a blast to play and having dumped a lot of hours into the console versions it runs like a dream on my PC and is a more enjoyable experience for sure if you have the hardware.

Now for the GTA Online side, this is where I would suggest some caution. If you're looking to just play solo and randomly hop into public servers, it's going to be a gamble whether you get a relatively decent server or one full of cheaters/modders running around deleting things from existence like they're roleplaying as Thanos. The online side definitely can be fun, to help avoid issues like that I'd definitely suggest looking for a GTA crew to join. There's plenty out there that have a decent community and once you start joining up on crew only sessions the online is a totally different experience.

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, go below, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

OK so this is a review strictly for GTAO ok? Alright.

GTAO is like an abusive relationship. You get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• over by everything in this game every 5 minutes, but you still keep playing because it's fun.

The game is constantly playing against you. You want to deliver your 2.8 million car for merely 100k? Yeah, yeah, sure, just let me spawn a couple of enemy NPCs that can randomly spawn at any moment (quite often literally in your way) and drain your car's worth significantly.

Ok, don't want to export your super sport cars ? Sure you can do some cargo missions maybe? Awesome, enter your BigBlackTruck and start a 3 box mission, which is basically a 50/50 chance for a 20+ minute deliver mission or a 5 minute delivery mission. Not that bad to be fair, but as I said, some of these can be completely cancerous to complete, ESPECIALLY if you're new. Try to take down a Valkyrie helicopter with your puny Carbine Rifle. It's not that bad when you have a homing launcher or a sniper maybe, but for someone who's new, (these cargo missions are for all types of players, be it new or veteran), it can be quite a hassle to complete one of these, especially picking them each and deliverin up to 5 miles to your warehouse.

Fine, it's annoying, but what about Heists? Heists are the selling point for some people in this game. Yes, you do get heist, and they're actually great, they're fun, they're enjoyable, though repetetive - they are fun... When they work. Unless you have 4 (2 for some heists and Doomsday ones) people, for best experience friends. They work wonders, it's really fun and challenging to go into a huge bunker, shoot up some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•' mercs and steal some delicous money. But see, you probably don't have friends, and you try to complete a heist with some randoms, well that's where the fun ends, because in some way this game has attracted a lot of stupid people, who can't even use a keyboard to play the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game. You could spend literal hours trying to get pass one heist and be amazed at how stupid people can be. 

Yeah there are more ways to make money but who cares? lol.

I do, kinda.

Freemode money making is a pain if you dont know how to make a solo public lobby. I don't want to talk much about this so imagine it as Vietnam war. With Jet bikes that shoot missiles, cars that fly, cars that shoot missiles, and cars that have literally saws on them. And you're a poor Vietnamese farmer, trying to tend to his field. Even though the game tells you to destroy people's business cargo and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like that (you get like 2-4k for destroying someone's 3 hours of work), DO NOT. TRUST. THE. GAME. In my eyes this is just an advanced trick to tilt players into making them buying shark cards, which are majorly overpriced.

I'm just writing this to let people know what they're getting into. You see a lot of reviews saying that there's a lot of KD warriors, modders, kids, griefers, although its true, in my experience they aren't that common. As long as you aren't in a 15+ lobby you really shouldn't
be afraid of people. I've truly met a lot of people who were bad, but it wasn't always bad. I had people come over and defend me from enemy spawns/police or even other players.



Rockstar honestly pleasantly surprised me with the new Casino update. To sum it up shortly: Quite a few ways to gamble, they are actually quite fun to do, I, personally, really like to play the different games and basically pray to RNG gods for a blessing. They added new cars, a few new missions, a penthouse ('highly' customizable) and my favourite feature: a Wheel of Fortune where you can win ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• lol.

This was really good content and a lot of people really did like it, but what most didn't expect is Rockstar throwing an unexpected curve ball and nerfing some PvP aspects like passive mode. Which is great.

Single player mode of this game is a god tier.

Banned (for 1 month), as many before me... for no reason what so ever... after playing 62 hours in a PRIVATE session with a friend ...
Account was reset and there is absolutely no point in ever playing this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• again.

Called rockstar support and the guy told me laughing that they hear this all the time. But they can't do anything and I'll just have to live with it. After all, in his opinion, all of us banned people are hackers and I'm apparently a liar for telling him I didn't do anything wrong (I was swimming in the ocean towards a boat..).

Since they are randomly banning people and not giving a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about it, Rockstar is now dead to me. Thanks.

Grand Theft Auto V is the definition of a love-hate relationship. It's one of those games that would greatly benefit from a "neutral" recommendation. This game does a lot of things right, and a lot of things wrong. I'll be discussing the single player portion and the online portion in seperate sections, as at this point they are nowhere near the same game anymore.

TL;DR at bottom!

General

The attention to detail throughout the game is absolutely stunning. Puddles are dynamic, people comment on your car as you drive by, cars will have their tires turned into the curb when downhill parking. It's mad. It's clear that significant amounts of effort when into creating a living, breathing environment for Los Santos.

The game is gorgeous. Everywhere you turn there is a beautiful sunset, impressive reflections, and eye-catching, vibrant colors. It's such a breath of fresh air compared to the generic brown/grey colour palette.

Luckily, optimization allows GTA V to run as smooth as butter. I've been running the game on a GTX 1060 6GB on ultra high settings, and have been consistently getting a 60-70+ FPS with very few frame drops. Friends with lower end GPUs have reported the same thing to me. This game is widely playable across a lot of systems in my experience.

First Person is a welcomed edition from the last gen edition of the game (if anyone still plays those...). Nearly the entire game can be played through in first person, which offers an interesting (and often times challenging) perspective for races, firefights, and roaming the city.

Single Player

The single player is, and always has been, an amazingly enjoyable experience. It's a lovely blend of gritty, twisted, dark plotlines and absurd, entertaining fun. There are some scenes that were a bit too much for me, () but this all ultimately comes down to personal preference. The character dynamic between Franklin, Micheal, and Trevor is fun to watch unfold throughout your time playing, which could be a while. It took me about 50+ hours to finish the main story, and 90+ hours to 100% it. However, content is limited thanks to Rockstars inability to hear the community's cry for solo content. A lot of people wouldn't mind spending $10, $20 on an expansion for the single player, but Rockstar continues to ignore half of it's game to continue to work on it's cash cow.


Grand Theft Auto Online

GTA Online sings a tune very different from that of the single player. Online is at best, a hugely entertaining passtime, and at worst, a horrible nightmare to play. The game essentially revolves around completing missions, jobs, heists, etc. in order to acquire large sums of money. You then use this money to buy vehicles, weapons, and property (which often times unlocks new missions, jobs, and heists to play at your disposal). The main problem with this model is that unless you're willing to grind your ass off, you're not getting anything quick. As more and more updates come out, the prices of things go up and up, all in a desperate attempt to push Shark Cards (In game currency for real money). What's even worse is that the value of Shark Cards has not kept up with the insane inflation that GTA Online has had over the years. On launch, $1,000,000 was an insane amount of money. Now it's chump change. With every new update comes millions upon millions of dollars you need to spend in order to get anything. The most expensive Shark Card in the game ($99.99 USD) gives you $8,000,000 in game. You will burn through that quick. So unless you're ready to spend a LOT of money to get everything you want, you'll be grinding. What adds insult to injury is all of the hackers spawning themselves infinite amounts of money, and all the bans that don't get applied. You'd be lucky not to have some sort of hacker in your lobby. They run rampant, with free rain to kill everyone and everything, and spawn themselves (and you) money. Don't worry, Rockstar will just ban them, right? That'd be nice. Most of the time they do ban waves, they catch thousands of innocent players who have worked hard for their money, and will either take their money or ban them completely from Online. It's entirely innapropriate and Rockstar really needs to work on it. So say you've acquired your money, you've bought some nice things, and now you're enjoying free roam. Prepare to be blasted to hell by one of the most toxic communities I've ever experienced. This game breeds toxicity. People will blow up you, your car, your plane, and your will to live. Low leveled players have little to no chance of fighting back, as they don't have sticky bombs, miniguns, or any other of the strong anti-grief weapons. Your only option after that is passive mode, which is no fun whatsoever. Basically, what I'm getting at is Online is a complete nightmare to play alone. However, if you and a couple buddies pick up the game and play together, you're in for some of the most fun you'll ever have. Playing races and missions together, away from public lobbies, is the most entertaining thing I've ever played. The most recent update, the Doomsday Heist, reintroduced new PvE content instead of the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, hollow PvP content they've been pushing lately. It's a huge step in the right direction for the future of this game, and if they continue on the path of PvE and co-op I can see this game lasting a lot longer into the future. I cannot stress it enough: If you plan on getting this game for Online, get it with friends!

TL;DR

Pros:
Amazing single player experience
Extremely detailed world
Beautiful scenery and environments
Impressive optimizations
Stupid fun
Recent updates for online are a step in the right direction

Cons:
Rest in Peace single player content
Stupid hard push on Shark Cards
One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen
Hackers run rampant
24/7 Grind to get anywhere

I want to be able to fully recommend this game 100%, but I simply can't. While I do fully recommend it if you plan on playing it with friends, the downsides of playing Online by yourself are staggering. I repeat, if you plan on playing the Online, play it with a couple of friends. You will enjoy your experience exponentially more.

DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS IT IS ON SALE. It has been 5 years since this game came out and and it has been great for the first 3 years. Now the DLC has become so expensive that you have to grind to get anything. Here is some of the price gouging rockstar has done to make you need to buy sharkcards. (I have not but it's clear what message they are sending)

Clothes
Everything was under $5000 by a lot at the beginng of the game. Now everything you buy is minimum $5000 or above.
Some outfits cost $60k to over $300k !!! Some that are literally just underwear.
Tattoos follow the same trend. They are all many tens of thousands of dollars.

Cars
The most expensive car used to be 1 million and then went up to 1.5 million and now it sits at $2.8 million WTF

Toys (things that make things explode, fly, or go fast)
They all cost over $2.5 million no matter what you need and some you need to spend more than $2 million to EVEN BUY

The pay walls are horrible and it shows the general trend in video games lately that the developer treats you like a cash cow. They try to milk your wallet like its an udder and at the same time don't even keep up the servers so that you don't get booted every 20 minutes.

Your ability to earn money is paywalled to hell and even then you are not in much luck anymore even with heists.

I've owned this game on xbox 360 and pc (payed full price for both) I have hundreds and hundreds of hours on this game and am incredibly saddened by how it's been shot to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

Do better Rockstar

We had fun in GTA Online before my friend got banned out of nowhere.

Yeah, the public playerbase was pretty bad, and the business model was scummy, but truth be told, my overall experience was great.

Playing mostly on private servers, my group of friends and I built characters from nothing together. As we made money, playing stupidly-fun minigames and going on deathmatch rampages, we created our characters‚Äô lore. Buying new outfits, houses, and cars, we created the personalities and relationships between our characters. From the first convenience store robberies we committed to the ‚Äúhard mode‚Äù heists we tried over and over to beat, everything we did spawned stories of our virtual lives.

After 140+ hours of glorious, stupid fun, we took about a month‚Äôs hiatus. We played a few other group-based games, such as ESO and Don‚Äôt Starve Together, but we ended up feeling inclined to reunite our virtual characters in GTA Online. After this time away, we were ready to have some more fun, reuniting in a game that brought us all closer together as a group.

That was until one of us logged on, saw that they had been suspended for 30 days, and read that their character had been completely reset.

Why was our friend banned? Who knows. Based on what I‚Äôve read (and we‚Äôve been studying into it for hours in hopes of getting our friend's character back), there‚Äôs no hope. Rockstar‚Äôs employed some sort of algorithm that ends up banning both guilty hackers and innocent players alike out of nowhere, with no distinction. I‚Äôm not going to lie, when we went onto public servers we frequently met hackers. The issue is that my friend wasn‚Äôt one of them.

‚ÄúYou have violated the EULA,‚Äù the suspension email states, ‚Äúthis decision is final.‚Äù

Rockstar, you know how to make a really good game - Red Dead Redemption and both Grand Theft Auto 4 & 5 were excellent in single-player - but I can‚Äôt support this blatant lack of care for supporting your online players. 60 dollars and 140+ hours just went down the drain, because your robot randomly banned our friend, you won‚Äôt say why, and none of your ‚Äúsupport‚Äù staff (if they even exist) care to respond to any players in the same situation.

I won‚Äôt support this bafflingly unprofessional treatment of GTA Online‚Äôs playerbase.

=====

Basically, single player is great. Online can be as well, but good luck not getting suspended or banned out of nowhere, for no reason. You won‚Äôt know why you were banned. You won‚Äôt get support. You‚Äôll lose time and money. And Rockstar won‚Äôt even care.

Me after a one-year break going to play online:
Let's see what has changed, maybe there is some nice new content.

Time to get back to normal life.

GTA 5 finally arrives on PC after a long delay but the big question is, was it worth the wait?

If you haven't played GTA on previous and current gen consoles then this you will definitely want to get it. The campaign on its own is totally worth the price and with all the Stranger missions, you will be occupied for some time. However, the multiplayer is what will keep you coming back to the game for more. Rockstar's main focus post-release is on GTA: Online and with their regular release of free updates, there's always something new for players to try out. For any beginners to GTA: Online, here's a handy and short guide with all the need to know

Moving onto performance which is one of the reasons why GTA was delayed so much for PC. There doesn't actually seem to be any major problems with running it. Because the game was made with PS3/Xbox 360 in mind, the required specs aren't amazingly high. Obviously, if you want to be running it in all it's glory and at high resolutions then you will need better equipment.

GTA series was one of my favorite franchises ever, i've been playing GTA since the first one.
I loved these guys so much, but with GTA V they showed their true colors and how only money matters to them, they showed you can crap on your fanbase because they're suckers that will still buy your games and content.

Previously i wrote a bad review because of some big flaws in the game, including how the game stopped working and support didn't want to help me, and multiple complaints overall. Then, two days later i got banned, my characfter was reset, all my money, vehicles, and my house were erased from history.

This is unacceptable behaviour, the devs are greedy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that never care about their customers and fans.

They mentioned 'cheating', i never cheated in GTA V, not even in SP. I never even had any shady software open at the same time as GTA.
I did run into an incident with a cheater that kept killing me whilist being invulnerable after we got in some argument, and he threatened to get me banned, but it was quite a while before that.
I did have recording of everything, but of course, nobody from Rockstar Support cared.
Cheaters can just steal your name and get you banned, it's the simplest thing.

Whether my ban and reset were because of my review, or because some cheater used my name and people reported him (while he was using my name), it doesn't matter.

This isn't a company i will ever forgive.

A highly priced game, with an noline system built to extort money from you if you want progression (otherwise you will grind for dozens after dozens after dozens of hours to get some cool vehicles, a nice house and whatever), a system built on purpose to make you want to pay extra for stuff.

I never minded grinding much in games, because it adds purpose, but in this case, it's total ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and rip-off.

On top of the game price, an 8.000.000 shark card costs 74.99 euros. You know what that money will get you in game? A nice car with mods. That's all.
It might seem like a lot if you didn't play the game, but no.

Shark cards indeed. Because this company, that many grew up with, and loved ate their fans alive, they're a shark tank themselves.

The game is also ridden with some nasty bugs, optimized like hell (CP2077 has graphics10 times better, has a bigger world, and advanced graphical technologies and works with 20% more FPS than GTA V, a game released quite some years ago).

If Rockstar ever wants to redeem themselves, they will need to stop destroying their players' hard work in their ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• online game, they will let people enjoy the game without intervening, they owuld fix what's broken.

Awful product, awful company, awful everything.
It's just a money siphon for them.

(And as a reference, 74.99 euros would be too much even for 8 billion in-game cash, not million. Because the money goes away fast, the more expensive vehicles/house you have the more you pay for in-game 'daily' fees, and one day in GTA V is not 24 hours either, it's 48 minutes)

Everybody and their mama knows about this game.

Singleplayer is fun, unique, funny, intense, gripping. The story isn't perfect or a masterpiece but it's still good. It's a pretty old game at this point, yet it still competes with anything released this year. It looks great, has great gameplay, well, it's the best GTA there is, couldn't really add anything more.

Online is fun, yet it could be improved so much in many different areas. First of all, the content itself could be much more diverse and less grindy. I understand that Rockstar games is making bread through microtransactions but still, grinding for a hundred hours to buy expensive things can get stale really quick. Secondly, many online mods in GTA San Andreas had better ideas for businesses and jobs in terms of their mechanics that make GTA V slightly underwhelming in that regard.

Next up are griefers. Damn, so many of these stacked up, high level kids with flying jet-like bikes that can automatically lock-on and shoot homing missiles. And there goes your slow ass post office van stacked with cocaine that you've been driving for the past 10 minutes to your destination and waited beforehand for an hour after paying for supplies to produce the product. It's a very large gap between newbies and daily grinders. It's also pretty overwhelming for a new player at first: plenty of activities, constant emails and messages, no idea where to start or what to do. Besides the griefers, the community itself is pretty good during missions and heists. It's true, they're mostly bad at their tasks or just can't cooperate properly but it seems that they always apologize for their mistakes and no one really starts insulting each other so that's pretty dope. I also have to mention the hackers. Though I see them constantly, the majority of them doesn't even bother me, they're mostly just having fun on their own and don't disrupt the crowd.

Lastly, the glitches and crashes. Yes, they're pretty common and it seems that Rockstar doesn't really care much about the majority of them. Crashing and losing your valuable product, glitching and getting stuck in the middle of the heist or just entering into an infinite loading screen is just another "feature" at this point. Though some glitches, such as teleporting or playing in a solo lobby, are almost necessary to ease your life a tad bit.

Overall, a 9/10. If online wasn't a thing, I'd give an 8 at most.

Buy this for the singleplayer story. It is well worth the price and easily has 100 hours of contents, if you don't speedrun the main story.
The Multiplayer has some good content and great contents, but that grinding is insane and very much pushing towards "micro"-transactions. The public free-roam servers are riddled with either greifers, hackers or non-english speaking people. This IS a PVP-game, but the rewards and weapons are unbalanced against the people that spend hours building up to a payday - and those that with little efford can ruin their work for a small reward.
There is a way to avoid those people in public lobbies though. Look around for it and thank me later ;)

After todays new game update you guys said "Original story: I feared GTA Online would die a slow death with the arrival of Red Dead Redemption 2's multiplayer mode on consoles, but it doesn't look like that's going to be the case just yet."

Just no.. GTA Online died when you morons decided to make it P2P (peer to peer connection) instead of dedicated servers, where ANYONE can use mods and cheats without consequences. You literally have around 10-20% of the people using mods, who just mess with you when you try to do missions (putting you in cages, killing you over and over again with their godlike/teleportation mode on etc).

I would have bought in game money for real money if it wasn't for the cheaters. Why would I spend one dollar more on this game where other players can just download cheats and give themselves infinite money? GTA Online could have been one of the biggest, if not the biggest online game if your management weren't absolutey morons. Happy you guys never became as big as Fortnite, you idiots don't deserve it at all.

Edit: To make things clear, I hate Fortnite lol. I've tried it twice, uninstalled both times within 30 minutes. You can go check Twitch, movies, shows, everyone is streaming/talking about Fortnite. Never said it was a good game but at least they try and they put out a lot of content and deal with cheaters which is why they've had big success. You can't argue against their success no matter what you think of their game. Rockstar pretends like nothing while so many cheaters are running rampart, ruining everyones experience. Real shame because I really loved the game itself, but I'm tired of cheaters messing with you for NO reason. Just for the attention because their life have no meaning and no one cares about them in real life.

I dont recomend this game because there is no support for it. If Your GTA thinks discord is cheating (because of the overlay) you get banned for 30 days no appeal and all your stuff is gone. You wish to appeal ....sorry we are game gods and we don't have to listen to you. I seriously want my money back for this game but there is no one to talk to. The only thing I had done when I looged on was talk to members of a crew to join. 5 minutes (or less) after I joined their discord I was banned. I will never buy another Rockstar Game again.

Basically they get to ban you for any reason with no apeal process to try and make you buy another copy of the game.

Do very much enjoy the game,
story in Singleplayer mode, occassional meeting proper Humans in Online sessions,
but,
99% of the time spent in Online Public Lobbies are distasteful,
not because of harshness in guns or vehicle fights,
but basically half of the lobbies cheats,
Godmode, Unlimited wealth, Full power to Bind/Banish/Manipulate anyone from enjoying their game.
Unplayable and unpleasant to be made a fool by these cheaters basically every session, prolonged agony with restarting and loadings ingame.
Despite all efforts in reporting cheaters, doubt much effects were taken against the overwhelming amount of cheaters.

Could only limit oneself into being alone in Solo lobbies.
Weary and Disappointed.


*


Criteria of Thumbs Down are not if based on worthwhile or playtime in game.

Unfairness in Godly Cheaters vs Legit and Hardworking players are simply too wide.

Found little reason to play online further, making a honest living and maintaining business grinds when Cheaters simply interferes your progress and connections with a few clicks at their own pleasure.

Game is definitely worth the experience,
even with just default legit modless singleplayer or online access.

If you want to buy it for the singleplayer only, go ahead. It is great, diverse and has a lot to offer.

If you are looking for a good multiplayer experience, skip this. They have locked down the MP a lot to allow for the sale of their microtransaction cards. It is a grindy mess, goes against the theme of the game. You don't steal cars, you have to buy them to own them, the expensive one everyone would want. You get punished for killing and destroying players and their vehicle in MP. Price inflation because of the microtransaction is a constant issue and the game without paying is grindy as all get out.

There is no online mode that allows you to mess with the the game. You can't for example have fun going on a rampage, because the game actively punishes you, both for setting you to be aggressive and also monetarily. Everything costs money. Weapons are locked behind a ranking system plus a cost, so when you are new and try to get into online, you will probably get killed by people that already have those unlocked with no recourse. Armored vehicles that cannot be destroyed without explosives will be the bane of your existance.

And of course they tried to kill off the modding community. So no, do not support them, if you are interested in multiplayer.

You can buy it for mp, if you have a lot of time and are completely bored out of your mind, because it will take you forever to get things done.

"I already WORKED for the REAL MONEY, and bought this game. WHY am I having to WORK MORE, just to PLAY..!?"

Just go get into some other F2P / P2W game. This one has a retail price, for some strange reason...

I mean, it was fun when it came out the first time. Hackers putting $2 billion bounties on people randomly... there was nothing more exciting than seeing every dot on the map suddenly turn and start chasing the bountiful bounty... So much money, though. Many would eventually split the massive amount of glitched money around the other players on the map. Hell-- Not like I even needed the $30 billion that would pile up on me.

But, that would only land many player in "virtual jail", if even just receiving said glitched money. Even a phone call to Rockstar support wouldn't change this. I tell ya, being treated like a pseudo-criminal is one thing, but for the very people I PAID for the experience, to treat an honest and faithful customer of many years like a REAL criminal.... Absolutely DISGUSTING.

Yes, I am bitter. May always be, at this rate. If the game could've just merited a little more attention OFFLINE (a.k.a. where I don't have to fear the Rockstar Police), then I might feel a bit more off-base with a "Not Recommended" review. However, this game is only getting development with the Online portion. And that is quite literally a "Pay-to-play" structure. Gameplay Online is severely reliant upon having the GTA$ to afford nearly every aspect of the game. Even other players can easily cost you money without even being cheaters. Just the typical griefing of online MP.

My final thought on this game online, which is all that counts to Rockstar, is the same thought I had countless times when playing, and struggling for cash to afford even some casual playing.....

Online is rampant with cheaters who ruin the experience for everyone. Was kicked out of my OWN Motorcycle Club by a hacker, and am forbidden to ever remake it. Sad that many players almost exclusively want to play in solo public lobbies just to experience the game without having hackers ruin their experience with trolling.

If you're buying this to play storymode I'll highly recommend you it's very pleasant and worth your time.

If you're buying for online then err maybe don't? Or Maybe Yes? I dunno to be honest it totally depends on your opinion after playing for a while if you ask me i had to go through alot of struggle because I'm a solo player but the thing that matters the most is public lobbies are full of hackers,cheaters or modders whatever you call them it's just Outrageous and R* be like: *Hackers where?R* Also: *Oh! Someone used Cheat engine to get MONEY?!? REEEEE INSTA Ban*

Just search for more info before buying kapitan. Yes?

If you're buying this game for the singleplayer, go ahead, it's a pretty fun and still somewhat amazing game, but don't go for GTA Online. It has been completely ruined throughout the years, every lobby you run into has a modder or more guaranteed, grinding is extremely boring and repetitive, and you'll probably run into hundreds of thousands of Broomstick MK2 braindead griefers trying to ruin your experience, and since the company (Cockstar) cares more about selling you virtual credit cards instead of actually attempting to make their game more fun or even playable, you'll most likely get a really negative experience in the online, and maybe even your account banned for nothing, and your personal info stolen and your internet DDOSed in the worst case scenario (modders can do that), unless you play solo (which kinda breaks the point of multiplayer don't ya think) or with friends only, there's really no point to the online. Which makes me really sad, since it has so much wasted potential because of company greed, me myself i love to dogfight in this game using jets and helicopters, but it's completely ruined when a tiny ass moskito which is really hard to hit comes at you with a barrage of absurd almost aimbot tracking homing missiles. Why do you have to be such pieces of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Cockstar?

The recommendation depends for what use do you download this game.

To be honest, If you want to buy the game to have fun and play with friends to have a good time with a honest game play then I DON'T RECOMMEND IT
-The game is dominated by Cheaters.
-Developers can do nothing against cheaters. Well they only ban people using free mod menu but it's rare.
-You are risking yourself to get your PC or laptop overheating, getting damage for some components, by cheaters.
-You are also risking yourself to get a DDoS attack.
-You will expose your IP address, in case you want to protect yourself against cheaters using a VPN, developers will ban you instead.
-You also opening yourself to possibility to get hacked.

If you want a better explanation.
In GTA ONLINE there are a lot of people that use CHEATS by using a MOD MENU, that will make a unfair game experience against you.
‚Ü≥What can a mod menu do?
-Grants them GOD mode, they cannot be killed by any reason.
-They can kill you automatically for the time they want just clicking the option in the menu they got.
-They can change their names even to already existing ones, sometimes they use your username in chat saying strange things.
-Also gives them the ability to be invisible in the map for the time they want, teleport to an exact location, fly without any flying vehicle, even follow you by different sessions.
-They can see your IP address, and use it to DDoS you, follow you to different sessions, even private sessions aren't safe.
-They can spawn ton of things near you, overloading your game, making it to crash, also sometimes it overheats your PC damaging some components of it.
-The MOD MENU prevents you reporting them, making your game to crash automatically.

Also if you report them by the Customer Service, developers just repeat asking you to report them in game, where you get crashed when you do it, so they are in the same team.

The food chain in GTA ONLINE is MODDER > DEVELOPER > NORMAL PLAYER

So.. if that is all the experience you are looking for, feel free to buy the game.
Also you are getting scammed by Rockstar, since they are selling a game that they cannot control.

-------------------------------------------------

Updated: 17 May @ 12:18pm

Yeah, the game is fun to play, cool vehicles weapons and there are ton of great/funny/cool people playing it but it is getting off hands.

All what I wrote is 100% what I experienced against Cheaters. Also I can add some more detailed experiences I had to pass trough, I have 3400 hours of game play in this game and for bonus I will tell you what I saw during a live stream too..
- I had the experience of a friend quitting GTA5, because he lost his interest of grinding after tasting the money drop from a modder.
- I also have been getting spawn killed in different sessions for no reasons. I mean everyone were getting killed because the modder was bored or a random guy started to fight with a modder in the chat, that's not fair, also it is not fair to being able to get spam killed because he has a mod menu and you don't.
- Getting invited to a apartment without accepting the invite, and getting killed by a guy spammng rockets or with a minigun at the door, I can guarantee that it is not a good experience if you were doing some stuff like missions or driving with friends.
- When I discovered that I was able to buy supplies and sell the stuff from bunkers and MC businesses, I experienced getting my cargo blown up by a user using GOD mode, I mean it's okay if some random person comes to destroy my stuff (that happens a lot and yeah it's part of the game) but at least I should be able to defend myself to make it fair, right?
- Getting in game messages threatening me saying he/she knows my IP so he knows where I live, (I know IP address does not give you the exact location but it is not a good experience).
- Getting some tryhards wanna be to challenge me, and then when they start to lose turning on their GOD mode to get their kills back.
- Getting DDoS Attack after fighting against a modder.
- Not getting able to log in on GTA Online because a modder was messing with my social club account (Disconnecting me over and over)
- Getting my game close/crash. I mean yeah not all the times are because a modder but you can tell if it is because a cheater or not, I mean, e.g. like getting the game crash every time you try to report a cheater, or when you say he is a cheater in the chat magically you get disconnected.
- I had a guy following me every time I get Online, I don't have him as friend, but he can join even my SOLO session, and the funny part is that he is doing that because he tried to kill me with his Jet on god mode (the user and his jet were in god mode, I tried to explode it with explosive rounds also tried to kill him but well that's how I knew the cheater was in god mode) but he failed, so I laugh and left the session, I assume he got pissed because a non cheater user made him look stupid. So he followed me and changed his name for mine and started to talk in the chat saying "I am a cheater report me please" and then crashed my game every time I log in.

Ah and had the experience of watching a streamer getting invaded by cheaters even in friend only sessions without having the cheaters as friend, the cheater joined even when the streamer was alone in a private session, I mean nowadays people can join and hunt you just having your in-game username, and well them crashed her game since she asked to leave and YEAH! the streamer is a Woman, not 100% sure but I assume that's why the cheaters wanted to join so bad, but why women have to pass trough this experiences? because a horny guy wants to play with girls?..

But after all the reports people made, what did Rockstar? Well... nothing. At least for me they just told me to try to report them using the in-game report system for a better result.

So... are all those things fair? I hope no one else get those experiences..

And for last...

Why is a person COOL if he/she has to have advantage over other people to play an Online Game?
I mean if the person is cool he/she should be able to play without any problem, without using cheats..

Sorry for my english.

Thats all, Have a good day!

Grand theft auto 5

Where to begin...the story of this game is good, had a great time making decisions and playing as Trevor, rumbling the streets as Franklin and getting fancy as MIchael. To make it clear, the story is good, and the gameplay style for singleplayer is good.
But the multiplayer on the otherhand, its a mess, a total mess...oh god it sucks.
Why? I paid dollars for this game, expensive dollars, and yet i feel like im playing a F2P Grinding game (warframe like grinding), the players have no perception at things, they kill you for no reason, they will F*ck your game up and blow your cars and probaly snipe you too.
Oh it doesn't stops there, MODS...yeah...mods, you know, mods for singleplayer is a great thing, modify this, play with this, play as sonic or shrek, get an custom super car inside it, good and awesome.
But on the otherhand AGAIN, multiplayer? Its a living hell.
I heard reports of people getting banned thanks to these "modders" by giving money to them. Some modders screw their sessions by transforming the players into objects, or attaching objects in them. First the abusive players, now these modders?

To Worsen it all, Rockstar only keeps releasing content updates, its good they are making good things for the game, but each time MORE expensive, MORE grinding, and LESS fixing their game, and LESS security methods for the multiplayer.


To close it all, Grand theft auto Five is a great game, and its great to be played with your friends, live your life in the game, enjoy the stuff. But it cannot be enjoyed with random players, meeting new players in this game, its like playing russian roullete. You'll live happily, or die in anger.

Welp, after 963 hours in this game i can affirmatively say that GTA V has been the single-handed biggest waste of my time in my life. And this is also factoring in my 5,000+ hours in CS:GO. The reason for this? its not that i didn't have fun in GTA Online, especially when you add your friends into the mix the online portion in this game is great. Single player was enjoyable as well, with a decent story and several laughs id say the 80 hours of single player was worth it. My problem with this game is the company behind it, Rockstar. As a company that has such a lucrative franchise as GTA how could someone spoil it? Well let me tell you.

GTA Online is driven by having fancy cars and the latest in OP military hardware to absolutely shred people that don't have something worthwhile to defend themselves. To obtain these vehicles you need BANK, and im talkin bags on bags on bags of money. Multi million dollar equipment, that would take HOURS of in-game grinding to be able to obtain. Thats where the flaw is. Having to put SOOOO much time into a game to get basic stuff, to actually have fun even. Just with high end sports cars that ALSO cost millions. A way around this? Buy shark cards... Rockstars very own cash cow. To get the best vehicle in the game (At time of review) which is the Oppressor MK II, you need a terrorbyte and a nightclub as well. All in all, about $5,680,000 in game money. To buy a shark card for that? You'd need a Megladon Shark Card, worth $100 USD. That right there sums it up.

Glitching is something that Rockstar hates with a passion, because it eats into their precious shark card sales obviously. I (like many others) took part in a property trade-in glitch to get 10's of millions of dollars. Why? to buy all the military style vehicles and pretty sports cars my heart could desire, without having to put hundreds of hours into the game further. At that point i had about 900 hours into the game. Of which i didnt have very much to show for it, compared to after doing the glitching of course. Now, since Rockstar doesn't like a loop hole in the game they made allowing me to get 10's of millions with NO THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, i get a character reset. Now why on earth would i sit back and think "fair enough" after i put 900+ hours into the game. This game as it sits is dead to me, if i ever play this game again i will be using a mod menu to give me in-game cash. The game is the biggest time waster to date, and i wont put anymore "legit" hours into this game. Years of playing online, gone in 1 second. Thanks Rockstar, for encouraging your fanbase to download mod menus... the very thing you hate ;)

Most of the online reviews are about online mode. Actually the single player can be give a 10/10. People give negative reviews are the people who buy the game only to play the single player.

‚úì Open world , its fun to roam around the city.
‚úì Good story
‚úì Can play as 3 characters
‚úì Good graphics.
‚úì Good sound effects .
‚úì Great sound tracks
‚úì Single player with all collectables and side missions can be played for a long time.
‚úì Online is fun

GTA V is totally worth the price. You won't regret playing single player. 10/10

Update:
Right now with the reduced price it's totally worth it

Modders have ruined the Multiplayer of this game. There obviously also are nice modders but they don't reveal themselves quite as often as the bad ones do.
If you play multiplayer, expect to:
-get killed by an invisible person,
-get killed by an invincible person,
-get killed by a person that can't be knocked back (by driving cars into them),
-get lifted into the skies by a water fountain spawned by modders that keeps you in the air unable to do anything, get killed by an uncounterable orbital cannon (repeatedly),
-get harassed by little script kiddies that think writing your IP in the chat actually has any value,
-get killed for no reason,
-get killed while doing sales (the best way to earn money) because rockstar actually tells people to do that and consequentally having your product get destroyed only to have to wait a few more days until you can sell again,
-get killed by a lot of people using the oppressor mk2 because they want to raise their k/d,
-get killed by people usting the oppressor mk2 just for fun.
Modders can also crash your game if they want to, so just keep that in mind :)

As you can see, the multiplayer includes a lot of getting killed which can be especially off-putting to new players because guess what, you unlock the good weapons at higher levels or have to pay huge amounts of money for vehicles to help you fight other players.

Don't get me wrong, I like doing PvP but only because I have already been playing this game for a very long time and I have the equipment to make it a more fair fight for myself.

Coming back to the topic of modders, there's a lot that they can do and very few that they can't. One of the few things that they can't do is behave and talk like normal people.

Most of my interactions with modders have gone like this: I see someone's cargo getting destroyed, I head over to investigate and kill the cargo griefer. As usual, they are using the oppressor mk2, a flying bike with the (second-)best missiles in the game, which makes it utterly unkillabke without the right equipment. As it turns out, even this equipment is of no use to me because the griefer is using a mod menu to give himself godmode, in which he is invincible. So after hitting a few missiles, they just turn around and shoot one missile at me, only to kill me instantly. Now on the ground the modder focuses me and basically spawnkills me until I'm forced to switch lobbies or someone else steps in so I can escape.

Got banned from GTA Online for 30 days by Rockstar even though ive never modded, hacked or griefed in this game.
So I am not recommending this is they are going to ban innocent people.
not only that, they are going to "Reset" my character, acting as if I modded values.
Also, not recommending this as in private matches for GTAO, you cannot do much, the game forces you to deal with the cancerous griefers in this online community.
and lastly the store is generic and boring, online is the only thing worth playing
but after almost 100 hours, and now I am getting banned for nothing? when I know people who actually mod and either never get banned or only get a 2 week or less slap on the hand, I think this game is really boring alone
payouts for jobs and missions online are terrible, sometimes it feels like there are too many things to check on everytime im online, other players can ruin your game by stealing your stuff in the online mode.

There are tons of things I really think suck about this game, if I could Id return it and spend my 20+ $ spent on this on something else. The only good thing is when I get friends and we can clear a public room and just do our things without having to worry about griefers, the MK2 Oppressor users and the Orbital Cannon users.
Playing with friends can be the only redemption unless you like greifers and a terrible moderation system that bans you for being in a room with random modders who you report but inturn somehow are banned instead.
Guess they dont know what the F*CK they are doing.
SO Cheers! Good Luck to you if you decide to buy it, it was fun before I got banned for a MONTH for playing the game legitly and grinding my @$$ OFF for little to no payout.
and I hope you dont run into any hackers and modders that cause you to meet the same fate as me.
Unless rockstar changes their mind and removes my ban/doesnt reset my account (idk why they are in the first place)
I may change my Review, cause I did have some fun until the grinding became the only thing to do (it is more fun with friends)
7/10 for the game itself
1/10 for their moderation service, especially since I know Modders who are still active and never banned (but I get banned..)
2/10 for RockStar as they need to fix this game A LOT
Better Payouts, more ways to pay associates without having to swap
being able to use the Motorcycle club and CEO stuff in private modes and without having to change between being a MC President and a CEO... cause that is tedious and annoying.
And for a better moderation service.
that is why RockStar is receiving a 2/10 from me. the game isnt terrible tho, but if I am getting banned for being innocent, I cannot recommend this game.

GTA Online was fun, farming and buying cool new items released quite frequently.... Until 1 day Rockstar decided that u have too much money and tempo banned and "corrected" all your hard work in 1 day. Have never hacked or glitched nor received any money from modders and this is how i was rewarded. Great job Rockstar!

Single player is great but online is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• so only play online if u are prepared to lose ur progress anytime.

This is one of the best games ever made, and I'm absolutely addicted to it.

But it doesn't deserve a positive review.

No, I'm not referring to campaign. I'm exclusively speaking about Online.

I won't even write everything I think. I'll just say this game is addictive as hell with the right people, but the problem is that finding the right people in this game is like finding a needle in a haystack. It's just hell.

The game is riddled with modders that always want to mess with everyone, and it's a real pain. If you want to mod for money, go for it. Everything in this game is disgustingly overpriced and the payouts for things are garbage. Making money in the game is easier than ever, but the problem is it takes too long, and the payout ratio when compared with the prices of items is just ridiculous. Not everyone has the time to grind for days just to afford one super car or whatever they want to indulge in.

But when you mod in order to mess with other people's gameplay and hard-work (e.g. cargo), you're just a worthless scumbag.

The sad thing is that Rockstar don't do anything about it. This has been a serious issue for years. They don't seem to do much about the modder infestation, and it's sad to acknowledge because this game is so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• amazing.

Do I recommend it? Unlike what my review states, yes, I do. It's fun, and if you have friends, it's even better.

But it doesn't deserve a positive review until Rockstar show they care about their community.

It's that simple.

Its a shame the company became the exact thing GTA V was making fun of.

First rule of GTA V: If you want to mod, DON'T GO ONLINE UNLESS YOU CLEAR THE BASE GAME FOLDER OF ANY ADDED FILES, otherwise, you get banned, I learnt that the ban system works like that, it sees any change in the base game folder and it triggers a ban, so that's it, if you mod, make sure the base game folder is back to the original state, nothing added, nothing missing.

Apart from that, we all know how GTA V and GTA: Online is, it's all good, the Online griindy, but not much as day 1, since I come from the Xbox 360 version, which I played Online from day 1, things have changed, but its still damn fun

The story in singleplayer is quite unique, but not for me, it just didn't really hit the spot. Despite that the game feels alive, the open world offers a lot to do and mods make that even better. As for Online, it has its upsides, but the one major downside is the community itself: Griefers, K/D warriors, overall annoying people and don't get me started on the "professional" racers in the races. Of course, there are some people that do actually enjoy the game and play it for fun or just grind their way to billions of dollars so it's not all that bad. Despite any of the before mentioned problems, the biggest plus is the game itself, the graphics are amazing (if you have the hardware to run them at least on medium) and the things to do are endless.
TLDR: It's GTA, you can't go wrong with any of them.

I've never hacked a game in my life, yet here i am with a permanent ban for being teleported round the map by a hacker along with everyone else on my server.

I've you're planning on buying the game purely for online, id like to warn you that the customer support is all but non existant. I paid good money and remained loyal to a game and this is how i get rewarded.

$100 for 8m is extremely expensive and gets you nowhere, online portion is just straight up garbage.

Becareful. They will ban you from GTA Online with a false flags. They banned me for modding, I don't mod singleplayer or multiplayer GTA V. They offer no support for false banning. They close the support ticket instantly and they will hang up on you if you call in.

The scale is dizzying. It's insanely detailed too. Gangs loitering on street corners, cracked roads, foreclosure notices, and police searchlights cutting through the night sky give the poor areas of the city a tangible layer of grime. In Vinewood, sports cars glint in the sun, tourists snap pictures with their phones, and obnoxious starlets bray into their phones about movie auditions. Wander through the countryside and you'll see backpackers, cyclists, and people walking their dogs. Extras in rubber alien costumes take smoke breaks on studio lots, and bikers cruise the desert highways... The world is breathtaking, the script is funny, the music is superb... and, most of all, it's really, really fun.

My character has been reset and banned due to unknown reasons. Rockstar goes hardcore on you if youre accused for cheating or something like that. Your character will be reset and your ban will last for a month. And thats pretty annoying when you have spent real money on your character and also having spent 80 hours in the game, not to mention buying the game itself. It is absurd how my account got banned from doing absolutely nothing and is being reset and I don't even know why.

You cant even appeal for your account because all bans are "final", so yeah thats pretty darn ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•

other then this tho the game is pretty fun haha, except you gotta run the risk of losing all your hard earned progress by getting falsly banned and a character reset.

I'm angry at the game rn though so im just gonna give it a bad rating because this is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and this major proiblem should not be happening on such a popular game.

GTA Online has become a haven for people to create and download mods to screw with everyone in a public lobby. Rockstar can't even get a grip on hackers that plague legit and fun game play. it's pathetic that some kid had to write code for the game so it would load faster. Hire better game devs you garbage ass company. Also, stop releasing on peasant console machines months before real gamers get in there. Great game but ruined by imbeciles.

You still not sure if you should buy GTAV? Well it's is hard to sum-up, but here goes. Most people I know buy it for the online aspect but there's much to love about the story as well. I'll try to be brief with two short "COOL" and "NOT-SO-COOL" lists to specify when I'm talking about what part of the game, enjoy and thanks for reading!

COOL: STORY
+ Plot, dialogue and acting. Rockstar somehow found a perfect balance of fun and realism in this one. Things go over the top like it should in a GTA game; but not in a way where you take nothing seriously, the story has a lot of weight to it. The main characters are written phenomenaly, I guarantee you'll have some great laughs and many surprises through the course of it all.
+ Gameplay is solid. Movement, shooting and controlling vehicles all have their learning curves but every challenge is something you can overcome by training yourself. You can also customize all your keyboard keys or even use a Controller, which seems to be easier to use for controlling aircraft by popular opinion. This GTA seems quite a bit tougher then previous titles however; you die surprisingly quick for one and acquiring larger of money is basically impossible early on in the game, but has it's reasons for being that way.
+ Atmosphere, area design and graphics in general are fantastic. Us PC users can tweak it any way we want so even lower-performance computers can handle the vast world of San Andreas. It's filled to the brim with NPC's; all with weird, interesting or simply funny dialogue and after a 100 hours you probably still won't have seen every detail.
+ The perfect game to find your own goals in. Wanna try to steal that helicopter on top of that base? Maybe just find out exactly how many pedastrians you can punch before getting shot dead by the cops? Fun times.
+ There are many challenges to be done, secrets to be found and achievements to attain. If you're a completionist like me you won't be done any time soon.

NOT-SO-COOL: STORY
- Fans of previous incarnations, especially San Andreas, might be disappointed by some of the changes. Mainly the reduced size of the titular island, it's still very grand for any regular sandbox standard but you'll still find that the "small" city of Los Santos is the place where 90% of the game goes down.
- Though you can save at any time outside of a mission, loading games or missions is quite a mess. While you're in the game at no point during any mission, race or other activity can you restart to try again; you HAVE to die or fail to get the option to restart. This can be infuriating during races where it's sometimes relatively easy to make a mistake you can't come back from and you either have to do the entire race or kill yourself to respawn at the nearest hospital. Not fun, and goes double for those trying to get gold medals for longer missions.
- Prepare to follow guides if you really want to get the most out of the game. Money isn't as easy to come by, so the "investment assasination" missions are something you should know about before ever getting them. I didn't on my first playthrough, so I missed out on a lot of things late-game.
- Meager or no rewards for doing a lot of the extra stuff in the overworld. No real reason to do stuff like collect letter scraps for 100% completion unless you're a madman like me.

COOL: ONLINE
+ All the gameplay and writing aspects from the story should apply here, but with some extra's. In online you're simply dropped into the world with nothing, and it's up to you to just earn money. Why? To get more money of course! And probably to acquire the huge array of vehicles ranging from old hippie busses and dirt bikes to literal plasma tanks and stealth bombers.
+ The game still receives updates occationally, and a lot of people still seem to be playing.
+ You can go at it completely solo, but I'l tell you it's better with friends. Get yourselves in a game, make a company, buy some assets and get to work. Most major missions in the form of heists need 4 players, so that would be the ideal way to go for it as waiting for random people to join your session can be quite a pain. Especially if they don't communicate and/or perform well.
+ Heists themselves are cool with a similar taste of grandeur to the story. But extra fun since now it's actually you and your friends dressed up in silly stuff doing it. Fun for the whole (adult) family.
+ There's a lot of fan-made content in the form of races and challenges that can range from cute to insanely awesome. Races in muslce cars that can jump are among my favourites.
+ Dude. Me and my friend dressed up as Elf and Santa for christmas. Painted a hovering, missle-shooting Delorean in jolly fashion, got ourselves some throwables... and started raining presents down from above. Then a hacker/modder/scripter came to us, beat us up for killing him, then told us our outfits were cool and gave us $100,000 each before leaving the server and kicking every one else but us from it. Then we went to the store, bought over 20 beers each and had a drunken brawl until there was no more booze to celebrate the occasion.
When does that happen? Only in GTA 5 Online.

NOT-SO-COOL: ONLINE
- Your Mileage May Vary applies. As an online game, your experience will heavily depend on your fellow players in the server. Half the time it seems every one is leaving each other alone, while one or two big companies do some work and duke things out. The other half; it's people who just want to watch the world, and specifically you: BURN. Be it in the overworld or inside a mission: grievers and just run-of-the-mill-buttmunches abound. This is why I suggest to play with friends. Found an evil hacker/scripter/modder? Just change servers is my advice.
- Loading times in general are long, and happen too often. Re-loading after doing a session, or leaving one because no-one joined, can take ages even if you're still in the same server as before. It also puts you and your friends in different servers at random, making the waiting times even longer which can be a big annoyance.
- The delayed controls, wonky character movement, laggy shooting and the infuriatingly unreliable phone (which you need to do anything) do not make this a good PvP game. There is little skill involved; most of online is just showing how much money you're willing to spend to kill someone. Don't EVER expect a fair fight, the game isn't about that.
- Finding random people to do jobs or missions with can also be a real pain. If any of them decide to ragequit then EVERYONE gets kicked back into Los Santos. Which means more loading times and a bunch of waiting until you can try the same mission again.
- Even harder then story, and not just because of the PVP. The Police and most other NPC enemies get a noticeable upgrade; shooting with insane accuracy.This really impacts the difficulty of the heists, which already have very meagre rewards for the amount of time you need to invest in them. This is obviously to push you to buy "Shark Cards".
- Making money and showing off your pretty cars and assets is the point of the game. This can feel shallow to some. I personally don't care for it too much, just do it with friends. I'd really see no point to playing online if I had to do it on my own.

And a final note: Don't let kids play this, please. Not only is it a mature game, I've witnessed a lot of borderline scary behaviour from the younger crowd who take things very hard. This game isn't for the easily distressed or those with a short fuse. Just a warning.

And that's it, I hope I kept things short enough and that this was informative to those who were still unsure on purchasing this after all this time. I'm a bit late with this review but I couldn't stand not making one while I have so many hours put into it. I probably forgot to mention a bunch of stuff but that's why I'll answer any questions you might have.

Thanks again for reading and have a nice day.

Currently sitting at around 666 hours played, so I figured now would be the time to leave this review. I've played this game since the 360 and xbox one on and off. Recently I switched over to PC, however, as character transferring was shutdown I was frustrated. I would even have been fine with a 1 character account transfer. It's obvious I've been a long-time member. To summarize what I have learned in the past month or so of playing on PC, I will list the pros and cons.

PROS:
-Story is excellent, modding single player is always fun.
-Online *can* be extremely fun, open world- especially with friends.
-Plenty of cars and customization for gearheads, as well as a variety of different weapons to choose from.
-Both easy and challenging missions/heists.
-Community can be go either way of being toxic or extremely fun.

CONS:
-Modders. If you play this game expect to run into some modders. Whether they're friendly or not is up to luck. They can either spawn in vehicles and be fun, or, give everyone money and destroy cargo you're trying to sell for some odd 100s of thousands of dollars. I meet one almost everyday. My suggestion is to play in an invite only session when you can, or, if you need a public lobby with only you, there are ways to make your own that google can help you find.
-Griefers. When you aren't getting harassed by a modder, you meet a griefer. There are people who will blow you up over and over until you go into passive mode, or that destroy your cargo. Note that these people don't get anything out of destroying it, except to just be mean. The excuse that the games tells them to doesn't make them less of an ding dong.
-Crashes. I'm not sure if this is due to modders or my own game, but sometimes, about once or twice a day I'll get the random crash and have to wait through the 10 minute loading screen. Note that modders can boot you out of a session and crash your game however.
EDIT: I haven't crashed as of recently, but I am still looking out for this one closely as I believe it is on Rockstar's side.
-Game age. While I admit I'm surprised to see this game as lively as it is right now, no game lasts forever. If GTA 6 has an online feature, gta 5 online won't be getting as many/if any updates and most of the playerbase will switch. So, if you're brand new it might not be worth the effort to get into a warzone as this, especially in it's current state.
-MK2 Oppressor. Do you think missiles are bad enough? What about jets? Now, imagine making a jet and compacting it into bike form. That's right, you have the oppressor mk2. A flying jet bike that can shoot missiles. One of the most adaptable, pretty fast vehicles in the game is also used for griefing. (For obvious reasons.) Anyone that plays gta should- maybe if needs one of these. While they are fun to move around in, they can also be very annoying.

This concludes my review of the game. As far as rating would go, I have a decent amount of fun on this game when I'm not being tormented by modders. If it were free of modders I would give it a 7 or 8 out of 10. In its current state however, I would say a 5 or 6. If you can make your own public lobbies then it isn't too much of a problem though. Thanks for reading. :) I would suggest getting the game IF IT IS ON SALE!!!!! and only if it is on sale, and trying it for the time steam allows you to before you can't refund it.

The singleplayer is great, worth a try - for me, the best story rockstar managed to tell. At this point singleplayer of GTA V won everything it could win, so there's not much to discuss about it.
However, the multiplayer is just a mess. There is definitely fun to have there with friends, but every time I decided to join a game, a full list of problems pops up:

- Most sessions are filled with cheaters. They either will turn you into a giant orange, bomb everybody on the server from an invincible flying submarine, and once in a blue moon they will ignore you or even have fun with the game without annoying everybody on the server.
- Some people aren't necessarily cheating, but buying these awful flying motorcycles that can spam rockets and kill basically anyone who isn't specifically prepared for encounter with these trolls. I am baffled that rockstar provided them with a legit tool to harass everybody in the session.
- Everything is confusing - starting from gathering a team of 4 players in 1 session to making a decision about what is worth buying or not. For example, I mistakenly bought a high-level property thinking that it would give me access to heists, but it turned out that it's basically useless until you pour into it 5x money that it's worth for it to return a noticable profit.
- The Motorcycle Clubs, VIP, and CEO as methods of creating groups are explained extremely poorly, and I still don't see a reason why can't they function as clans in any standard MMO.
- Half the time me&my friends have troubles logging into sessions or online at all. Every now and then somebody randomly disconnects or the whole session goes offline for no apparent reason. Game can hang during loading and mess up the mission progress for everybody else
- EVERY time you login to session, prepare for 3-9 voice calls from NPCs nagging to you about uninteresting stuff - side quests for killing npcs, missions about selling cars and other busy work. single player contained most of these, but for some reason did not need to bother me every day with messages about them
- Aside from heists and generic multiplayer stuff (races, deathmatches), most of the time you wouldn't be actually playing the game for fun. Most of the time is spent doing busywork: selling product from your businesses, promoting your nightclub, taking supplies to your businesses. This is because heists require a significant amount of money to prepare for them (buying property that gives access to it, and most of the time you need to also pay initial price, so the profit will be given after 3-6 missions, depending on heist). Getting to a highlevel heist such as casino feels like playing a mobile city-building game: you have to log in each day to not miss the daily objectives to get 30k; you have to spin the casino wheel for a chance of 10-50k; you provide your businesses with stuff and sell stuff (this will result in 3-5 trips around the city, just riding bike or car, nothing else. The more you have stuff - the more you have to ride). It feels exhausting.

The impression from GTA Online is that of an old MMORPG, but with a dozen disadvantages from a regular MMO. The game is clearly designed to force you into the loop of unnecessary, boring busywork, padding out interesting content - while forcing you to spend real money on shark cards, that would free you up of this busywork. It's a shame, since I don't know any other game that gives you ability to do heists with this amount of choices by the mission design, and by inherent fact that you are playing GTA and can go off the rails most of the time.

The first thing I read was a tooltip telling me to call a contact called "Blimp". I did this. I ended up hiring a blimp.
I didn't know how to fly, so I accidentally flew into controlled airspace.
I was getting shot down, so bailed out assuming I'd have a parachute.
I didn't have one.
I landed in the ocean and survived.
I didn't know how to swim.
I drowned.

Playing fetch with my dog Chop.
Threw the ball at a pedestrian to see what would happen.
Pedestrian gets pissed, but I accidentally pull out my shotgun.
Pedestrian runs away in fear.
Suddenly my dog decides to chase him down and maul him.
The pedestrian dies.
Go back to playing fetch.
2 minutes later an ambulance arrives for the mauled guy, runs over Chop.
Karma is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• :'(

I love this game.

More seriously though: I've played every GTA since 3, and they've all been fun but only for a short amount of time. I only did missions for the sake of progress and to get new stuff. I never cared really. Not the case with 5 at all. I haven't come across a single thing that I can point at and say "that's not good". The depth and attention to detail with every single thing is incredible. The character switching really keeps the singleplayer fresh too. Every feature/facet/minigame feels equally or more detailed than games that focus on those specific things alone.

GTAV is one of my absolute favorite games, even if not everything`s perfect.
There is the story mode: This is the positive part of the game. A great story with indescribably great characters. A detailed and big world. There`s so much to explore. The graphics are already breathtaking. With great attention to detail.

BUT! There is also the ONLINE MODE: That's downright ridiculous. Endless loading time, overpriced content, boring missions... I'm annoyed by GTA Online. And I don`t play it anymore.
Nevertheless, I rate the game as positive, because the main game, the story mode, is just awesome

Before I get swarmed by a horde of fanboys, I don't think the game overall is bad. The Story Mode is fantastic, nothing wrong here, but I'll be focusing on Online. Sure, the loading screens are a pain but if you're willing to partake in the content you actually like and dedicate yourself to a bit of grinding, that shouldn't be an issue. That's exactly what led me to this - the game being so good that I'm baffled by how they ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on it.

Evidently, the issue is Rockstar itself.
It doesn't matter how long you've played for or how much you've earned over that period. Everything can and will be taken from you if R* just so decides to indulge itself in randomly banning people. No reason will be stated, no justification and no way to appeal.

It's pretty much just R* going "‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• You!" and if you ask "Why?" the answer is "Because ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you, that's why."

Beautiful and awesome game, especially when playing with friends, but has non-existant customer support.
Hackers are everywhere and rockstar's system only seems to ban legit players, furthermore, they will not accept responsibility for this and will not unban you regardless if you have 100's of hours in game and/or have poured money into the P2W system.
It has one fo the most toxic communities out there, you can't drive anywhere without being obliterated by some dude who's hacked in a tank. The new update only encourages this by telling everyone in the session to kill anyone doing missions for minimal payout.
8/8 was a CEO and lost money to random hackers/greifers online, then got banned because having your internet drop out whilst customising a car is an attempted 'money glitch.'

All of rockstar's efforts and funds have been put into making money and trying to protect it with anti hacker systems so strict they ban regular players and not a decent support system or more interesting content.

EDIT

Rockstar's 1 month ban is now over, I contacted them multiple times through their ticket system and by phone to no avail so I waited it out. They also decided to remove the 2 mil I grinded for hours to get.

Good old sandbox murder simulator. Always loved GTA and 5 does not dissapoint. I could wish the gunplay was slightly more exciting but the driving is great and the flying is like simulator level good. I'm not a fan of the online because of the intense grinding/pay to win progression system. If I actually had access to all the vehicles, specifically planes, I would give this 10/10, and I'd have given it 10/10 at release, but nowadays 6/10 thanks to the pointless restrictions on fun. I put a lot of hours in this game, mostly before the newer stuff was added, and I don't think that should be locked away from me unless I put another 500 hours or ¬£200 in.

GTA Online doesn't have any anticheat.

With GTA Online being a game where you can purchase currency for the game with real money surely they can't legally be selling shark cards right now. Someone can literally spend ¬£50 on a shark card and have all that money drained by a modder in seconds. With this catastrophic exploit in the game surely Rockstar are not legally compliant in still selling shark cards until this is fixed. So I urge them to take shark cards off of steam until this is properly patched.

GTA V is a hit-or-miss game. The greatness shines in the singleplayer with its amazing and flamboyant narrative, good character development, and well-written dialogue. I would certainly recommend buying the game purely for the story mode - at a discount of course. I don't think it's worth the $59.99 price tag as it is. If you're a fan of a good crime narrative, GTA V is definitely the game for you.

Perhaps the weakest element of GTA V is the online mode. Most of the reviews here are complaining about the modders, hackers, false bans, and griefing players who ruin the experience for other players, which is quite true. However, let's dive into the more fundamental elements of the online mode's overall design structure. This review will be mainly about the online experience, as Rockstar continues to update the game's online sessions with new adversary modes and DLC today. If you're buying the game solely for the online experience, exercise caution.

DESIGN : In a nutshell, GTA V's online design is nothing short of awful. The menus are incredibly cluttered with lists upon lists of jobs (mission, races, stunt races) to do, and some of them don't show up. If you want to do a mission, you'll need to scroll through menus of needless tabs just to get to your specific mission unless you bookmark it. If you want to do missions with your friends, you'll need to go through multiple loading screens to start them. Loading back to free-roam takes a few minutes.

Matchmaking is some of the worst I've seen in an online experience; it can take anywhere from one to fifteen minutes to gather a group of 2-4 players together to do any mission. When the game actually does pair you up with someone else - assuming you don't have many friends who play the game - it is with literally any player with any skill level. The game will sometimes pair a high-level player with most of the weapons and rewards unlocked with a low-level player with most of the weapons locked, often causing the job to fail due to player inexperience. Invites sometimes don't reach your friends, glitches with menus occur, and there are still many gamebreaking bugs that prevent the online mode from being a decent experience.

If you're a fresh player just joining GTA V Online, good luck - most of the weapons are locked behind a level requirement. It will take you weeks to months to gain enough reputation to get the weapon you want - rocket launchers, grenade launchers, explosives, etc. Rockstar can also dish out permanent bans regardless of behavior, and you cannot appeal them. In summary, don't anger Rockstar.

AI : Very unforgiving. At times, the AI will be perfectly cunning, dodging and weaving around obstacles to gun you down where you stand. During missions and heists however, most of them are unfair. They never seem to miss; they always have their reticles glued to you, so the moment you pop your head out to return fire, they quickly whittle away what little health you have.

You can restore health in combat with snacks - purchased from convenience stores around Los Santos in free roam/freemode. If you want to heal when you're being gunned down by police, mercenaries, or gangsters, you guessed it; you need to open your interaction menu, scroll down to inventory, scroll down to snacks, and spam the enter key to heal your character, then exit the menu to resume combat. Run out of snacks or armor during a mission? You will need to quit to freemode, drive to another convenience store - or CEO office - and restock them. Buy too much and the convenience store will run out of snacks, forcing you to drive to another convenience store to buy more. How inconvenient.

The AI isn't easy at all online, and requires precise movements, well-stocked equipment and health, and pure luck to beat them down.

JOBS : Some online jobs - similar to quests in an RPG - require you to have more than 2 players. If you start a solo session or an invite only session, most of the fun jobs are all closed off, with Rockstar prompting you to join a public session with other unpredictable players in the lobby, because Rockstar wants the playerbase to mingle. In hindsight, it might seem like a great way to connect with other players, but with the hit-or-miss community of "public lobby" GTA V Online coupled with matchmaking flaws, it's difficult to get anything done.

Want to do a heist? You are required to gather 4 players together to do them. Individual heist setups can take anywhere from 5-20 minutes. If you fail a heist setup? Moreoften, you may restart from a checkpoint and try it again. If a player leaves the heist setup? Everyone fails the mission, and the party leader will need to exit to freemode, go back to their apartment, re-initiate the heist, and find 4 new players, rinse and repeat. Heist finales contain the highest payouts, with rewards spanning from $80,000 to $200,000 depending on the heist, and can range anywhere between 10-30 minutes to complete. There are rarely checkpoints in heist finales; players have team lives instead of individual lives. If one player dies, your team loses a life, and in 99% of the heist finales, only one team life is available. Therefore, if one player continues to die and uses up your team's lives, you will need to replay the entire heist finale from the beginning or checkpoint. If one player leaves or disconnects while the heist is in progress, you will need to gather another 4 players to do the heist finale from the start.

PLAYERBASE : GTA V Online's playerbase is really a hit or miss, though they should be somewhat feared. There are some decent and friendly players who are looking to have fun with heists, rewards, and such, but the majority of the time you'll be killed the moment you leave your apartment - run over by cars, sniped from afar, etc; this can be combatted with the game's passive mode - a mode in which other players cannot attack you, and you cannot attack other players or pedestrians. The problem with this mode is that you can't rob stores, take part in public lobby events, or defend yourself when the cops begin pursuing you.

Also, there doesn't appear to much of a localization option with other players; you are grouped together with players from around the world. God forbid you get paired up in a serious heist where communication is next to impossible due to a language barrier. 50% of the time, you'll luckily encounter an English-speaking player. Most of the other players are from other countries, which makes coordinating missions and jobs frustrating if you or others don't speak a common language.

DLC/BUSINESS MODEL : The game's online items and cars are progressively getting more and more expensive. Super/hypercars cost upwards of $1,000,000 to $6,000,000. There is a plane in-game for $10,000,000. Luxury yachts go from $6,000,000 to $10,000,000. CEO offices go from $1,000,000 to $6,000,000. Apartments go anywhere from $40,000 to $2,000,000. If you're earning $10,000 per job, and about $80,000 per heist in a great while, you bet it will take a long time to buy the things you want. Rockstar releases "free DLC" every few months, which are nothing more than introductions of new vehicles and buildings with inflated price tags. Don't want to play the game to earn money? Simply buy shark cards. $20 USD gets you 1.2 million dollars. $100 USD gets you 8 million dollars. And Rockstar wonders why modders and money hackers grow by the minute. The business model with "free DLC" is simply a hellish sanctuary for micro-transactions. You're not buying a $60 game. You're conned into paying for a $500+ game; that is, unless you either grind out every bit of cash slowly, or stay the heck away from online.

Overall? Beautiful story. Story mode gets
9/10.
Greedy Rockstar in online mode. Bad design, mixed playerbase, unfair AI, disappointing rewards, but fun with friends. Online gets a
4/10.

How this won "Labour of Love" is beyond me,
the devs add nothing new to single player only adding more and more products in the predatory online game mode which are made purely for the common schmuck to not afford so they will flock to "ShArK CaRdS" they are only adding things to milk the playerbase which is now nothing but modders and hacks which R* has made no effort to exterminate.

None of this new content is added to singleplayer the new vehicles, customisation, locations and mission are locked to online so to experience any of it one would have to sink MORE THAN 200 hours of grinding into the game while playing against money drains like literally paying the daily bills, garage fees, power bills for your house, paying out insurance companies,
OR one could give into R* greasy pestering and fork out money to buy shark cards, a classic example of create a problem, sell the solution.
R* have truly sank as a game developer even going as far to attempt to push these predatory tactics in the new Read Dead Online.

If you're buying this for online you are doing nothing but paying for the opportunity to pay more money. The online can basically be described as a paid for free to play game.

People created this false hype of GTA V having endless possibilities with the PCs glorious ability to mod eveything but R* seem to be fully against this by making it harder and harder for people to mod the game with every update for fear of them having fun by modding in the vehicles and items from GTAO (GTA Online) into singleplayer without bleeding some money into R*'s purse.
The mods that are available for the game are bare basic and aren't anywhere near what we expected to be able to achieve for instance to the extent of Skyrim.

However the single player is great fun despite lacking the hulk of paid for/locked content for online but that may be remedied by installing one of the few mods available.

I RECOMMEND ONLY THE SINGLE PLAYER
Probably one of R*s best works taking elements we all loved from the classic GTA: San Andreas such as recreational activities like golfing, tennis, working out even yoga and combining that with the new updated GTA style and gameplay.
It also has some of the best graphics and optimisation of recent years being a near perfect PC port, in my opinion, with ability to play perfectly with a controller or mouse and keyboard.
Also a great game to play with the Steam link.

R* is currently taking legitimate money away from hundreds, possibly thousands of players. Their cheat detection is flawed and honest players are paying the price for it. I worked hard during some of their double cash and RP events and had it all taken away as illegitimate right before the release of the next DLC. I thought it was in error, and I put in a detailed help ticket explaining how I earned the money through their events. I received a generic response that I was exploiting the game. My shark card money was taken away as well. Do not buy this game.

Until today, I did not write a review for this phenomenal game. And Grand Theft Auto V definitely deserves a praise.

Even though I only played offline plots of the game, I still regard it as a must play.

GRAPHICS
Can't believe this game was released in 2013, for the graphics are still great to enjoy even nowadays. I can say with no exaggeration that Grand Theft Auto IV has a good picture quality which is not yet out of date.

PLOT
The plots of Grand Theft Auto series never fail you. The thrilling and tortuous plot is always fascinating and a attraction to all players. What's more, Rockstar is always good at making a character.
They use many statements ‚Äã‚Äãand actions to create realistic characters, along with unpredictable storylines. So here I wanna talk about the three characters in GTA V.

CHARACTER
Franklin
Black, street gangsters. stealing cars for a black car shop owner to make a living. He's always dealing with all kinds of troubles for his unworthy brothers. The only relative was thinking about his own small house. And he is often in the conflicts of various gangs.

Michael
A former robber, semi-retired, financially surplus. His wife has an affair, his son is addicted to games and drugs, and his daughter aims to be famous no matter what it takes. His painstaking effort was not only not understood but was rejected by the family.

Trevor
A former Air Force pilot who was refused flight due to psychological factors, and a gangster, was deeply self-blame for having to escape alone in a robbery ten years ago. No relatives and no families, only two errands.

Stripped of their evil labels of "robbers" and "criminals", their living conditions are far inferior to ordinary people.

So I understand Franklin very well. He just wants to make more money, do a big job, get rid of the poverty, and it is best to help the brothers. As long as he has money to take, as long as he can help the brothers, he is willing to do anything.

It's not difficult to understand Michael. Betraying his teammates, getting rid of all this, seeking help from a psychologist who can't provide a little help but that expensive, and get involved in trouble again to help the corrupt FIB officials do dirty works. All those just to stabilize the family and hope that the family can live peacefully and smoothly.

Trevor is a freak, but everything he does is reasonable. He was so upset that he had escaped alone, so he was furious about Mike's fake death and Brad's true death. He robbed it not for money, but as a great cause that could be entrusted to it for a lifetime.

Life is so helpless, sometimes you may not really have much choice.

Even though I chose Ending [b[C[/b], I know it can't be real at all.

Trevor can repeatedly make trouble with other gangs because of an insult. And just because O'Neill brothers robbed his own drug business and he did not hesitate to kill all of his brothers and thus make enemies with the buyer. For the sake of his old friend Michael, who has not seen him for many years, he can repeatedly endure the unreasonable arrogance of FIB officials and give up the raw materials stolen from the bottom of the sea after careful planning. Such a man of temperament, after learning that Michael's betrayal and the news of Brad's tragic death, how could he let Michael be alive?

Michael's family is close to collapse, and his wife has already issued Trevor's eviction order. It was the appearance of this old friend that his family's decline continued to intensify. Not to mention that he knew how Trevor would react once he learned the truth. For the sake of family and hard-won peace, can the powerful thief in the past endure FIB's control for many years, but will not attack Trevor? Besides, he has betrayed Trevor once.

As for Franklin, even though he has become a rich man in the end, his mentality is still nothing but a poor. But his ideas are not the same as his brothers. He has goals. Then one side is the corrupt FIB official who can bring him back to the prototype or even his life. The other side is the rich capital boss. He is too late to entangle between the two choices of killing Trevor and killing Michael. How can he think of a counter-attack?

GTA V, not an ode to heroes, nor a contemporary copy of Robin Hood. It is just the dance and tragedy of a group of losers, and it is the most insignificant scene in the surging human drama.

Only worth buying for the story and if you have friends to play with. Public servers are impossible to enjoy due to cheaters/hackers everywhere. Also, almost everyone you meet online is just looking for a fight and/or a way to annoy you to no end.

It's also excessively grindy. You don't unlock all weapons, clothing and cosmetics until lvl 100 and you're very limited when you first start. Money is painful to obtain too, so if you don't have time, you may want to just buy shark cards so you can start with millions and actually have a little fun.

Grand Theft Auto V
Note: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.

A huge graphical jump from GTA IV, GTA V brings us the city of Los Santos, in grand detail, from the towering Skyscrapers, to the beautiful mountains. You'll find yourself constantly surprised by the level of detail that Rockstar put into this massive world. Gorgeous lighting effects, incredible weather effects, fantastic audio, and smooth animations come together to immerse you in Los Santos on a whole new level, especially when you check out First Person mode. As with most games though, faces leave something to be desired, though they are a huge leap from GTA IV.

From raging shootouts, to daring getaways, GTA V is a game that's hard to step away from once you start playing. Fantastic levels of customization for your clothing, cars and hair. The well-written dialogue and voice acting help to bring Los Santos to life as you ride through a bustling downtown, or take a relaxing drive through the mountains. Time and time again you'll turn a corner and find yourself complete surprised at what you find there. You could easily waste hours just poking around the environment. There is something here for everyone.
Story	
7
A decent length story to go through, which spans across multiple intertwining characters. GTA V delivers another decent story by Rockstar. Though not particularly enthralling for the first bit, it certainly picks up the pace as it gets further along. You'll meet some fantastically outlandish characters in typical Rockstar fanshion, and get caught up in some ridiculous events. GTA V accomplishes what it sets out to be, a blast from start to finish.
Multiplayer	
9.5
This is frankly where GTA V shines the most. A massive improvement upon GTA IV's multiplayer. With the inclusion of Heists, GTA V added a grand amount of depth to the multiplayer, allowing you to set out on multi-step missions with your friends. Or, you can simply cruise around Los Santos and murder as you please. Take selfies together in hilarious places, get in fistfights on top of skyscrapers. Skydive, swim, play darts, tennis, or golf. Watch a movie, go to strip club! Get completely smashed! Survive an onslaught of Meth dealers, or cops, together! Play it however you want, create the character you prefer with a great level of customization being offered. The only place that GTA V loses points is in its absolutely awful menu system. Creating a private session, much less staying in it, with your friends is a convoluted process that Rockstar hopefully sorts out. Loading times are also horrendous, even with the game installed on an SSD. But don't let that stop you from playing multiplayer in GTA V. It is not an experience you want to miss out on.
Replayability	
10
There are plenty of ways to die in Los Santos, and you'll spend a long time enjoying each and every one of them. Especially with your friends. The huge array of missions and activities in the world offer you plenty of incentive to come back and play again and again.
Overall
9.6/10
Though it took Rockstar an absurd amount of time to prepare the PC version of GTA V, it's a slam dunk by all accounts. Easily the best GTA yet, especially when multiplayer is taken into consideration. With massive replay value, great graphics, enjoyable gameplay, and lots more going for it, GTA V is a game that any player would be hard pressed not to enjoy.

Also of worthy note is the video editor: Here's a clip I put together of my friends and I having some fun: The Chase

Grand Theft Auto V

Well, I played GTA V before on PS3 and I loved every moment of it,
I played it allot on PS3, about 75 hours on story mode and 80 hours on multiplayer.
It's not much but as I said, I liked it a lot.

So... the moment we have been waiting for!
Grand Theft Auto V on PC!

I bought it again for PC
because I want get the best experience that this game can give
and play with my best friends that have only PC.

I have GTX 780 Ti and it runs well on it, decent fps.

Story mode is great
and characters are even better (like in every R games).
In this game, we will have 3 main character

[A bit of spoilers]
Michael De Santa
A retired bank robber, who,
after making a deal with the FIB,
moves alongside his family to Los Santos,
where they live in a nice mansion.

Franklin Clinton
A young man who dreams of becoming big-time in Los Santos,
in a world where the glory days of street gangs has long passed.
He works as a repo man for a car dealership,
but his ambition makes him tired of the job.

Trevor Phillips
Is a mentally unstable guy and bank robber.
A former military pilot, he based himself in Sandy Shores,
where he founded Trevor Philips Enterprises,
which mainly deals with weapons and drugs. (He's my favourite character).


Grand Theft Auto Online
Multiplayer with a lot of stuff to do (if it works).

Game Modes

- Free Mode - my favourite thing to do in this game!
- Deathmatch
- Race (including standard, GTA and Rally modes)
- Capture
- Survival
- Hold
- Contend
- Raid
- Parachuting

You can have fun killing civilians
or just chill and ride your car around beautiful places (what I like to do).

Heists are additional GTA Online missions
that you can complete with your friends or with random people.
It's really cool and a lot of fun,
you will probably enjoy it!

So the conclusion is
that you must have this if you're a PC gamer,
as this game has almost everything (killing to racing).


The verdict is a Must have game
that you will enjoy playing alone or with friends.
As I said thousands of times,
it is fun and epic!

Enjoy and have fun!

I only play story mode,never play online or use any MOD.So this is a review simply based on the original single-player portion of Grand Theft Auto V.If you buy this game to play online mode,please just ignore my review.

I think it is a great game.Maybe the greatest game I've ever played.I buyed it by full price in 2017,it's still worth the price.

Pros:
+Extraodinary story.
+Three protagonists ,Micheal,Travor and Franklin.Two Americans and a Canadian(Trevor) with totally different characters.ÔºàI love Franklin,he is cuteÔºâ
+Interesting npcs,funny plots and quests.
+A very large and well designed open world map which depicts the whole city of Los Angeles.
+Pretty nice graphics, well optimized(even my old pc can run it smoothly....by the lowest level of graphics.)
+You can select first-person or third-person.
+Happy single-player experience of 40+hours.

+/-Hard to aim when shooting,that little white point is too small to find.(2017/11/11 edited: seems that this can be changed in settings)

Overall rating:9.7/10

So here's my review on both Grand Theft Auto V Story Mode & Online.

Grand Theft Auto V Story Mode

pros: + Amazing graphics
+ Very good gameplay
+ Great physix
+ Lines are hilarious :D
+ Steven Ogg who portrays Trevor in-game, has also portrayed Simon in "the Walking Dead" tv-series
+ Great story
+ You can even choose how the game will end. Yup choices matter but only in the game's end
+ Very good missions
+ Oh my the O'Neil Brothers [Dale, Dalton, Dan, Daryl, Don, Doyle, Earl , Elwood, Ernie, Ned, Walton, Wynn] :D

Grand Theft Auto V Online

pros: + Amazing graphics
+ Very good gameplay

cons: - Loading times are so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• slow they can break balls. The other day i was waiting like a half an hour.
- Lot's o' glitches
- In online prices are super higher than story mode. I mean 15-20k for a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• tattoo?
- Takes a lot of time to earn enough cash for better homes

While Grand Theft Auto V Story Mode is super game 11/10, Grand Theft Auto V Online on the contrary is a mediocre game 5/10. I'm givin' a positive review only for the Story Mode. Not even bother with online.

I liked this game, for a while. When I first got into it, it seemed like I could have a lot of fun doing the big missions and heists, gradually getting cash for more and more exotic assets. But unfortunatelty, gradually can go a long way, and this game proves that. Over my 400 hours I feel as if I've accomplished nothing. And that's the reason for some of the people who play this gaming having thousands upon thousands of hours on this game. Most of the missions have minimal rewards to them, providing only a smlal amount of cash. While $100,000 may seem like a lot of money given to you after doing an hour of cargo missions, that's not even enough to buy most of the cars you'd ever want to. You have to spend more like 20 hours for that. And that's made longer by the fact they put limits on how often you can do certain things.

And after you finally get that car you want, it becomes boring pretty quickly after that, and all of a sudden you're grinding for something else. And with how broad the selection is, and with them adding a new swath of cars every now and then, it seems you can never truly be satisfied playing this game. Which is stupid, because you're playing to feel satisfied, but you can never be. It's like cigarettes - you can never have just a few, you've always gotta come back for more, and more. Which is why I say this game is addicting. But not candy crush addicting. It's like heroin addicting. Sure, they're both fun, but at least Candy Crush isn't ruining your life and your family.

And you'll have to start telling your wife you spent that $50 on gas for the next few weeks, when really it was for shark cards. Ultimately, she'll become more and more suspcious, but by the time she figures it out you're so far down the rabbit hole you're willing to put your kids up for adoption just so you can have more money to buy that new set of cars in this game.

This is of course made worse by the fact they have no anti-cheat system, it seems. Making just about every lobby a "hacker lobby." Of which can get you banned relatively easily, and takes away from the experience of the game, considering most people who do hack are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. But some of the ones who do hack are doing it for money, only because Rockstar has their thumbs up their ass and expect all of their players to tryhard their lives away (assuming they had one in the first place).

The elaborate review is to demonstrate how pissed off I am at this game. I've had great moments of fun and memories on this game but in the back of my mind I'm always angry at Rockstar for doing something bad to the game, and I'm not wrong for that. I wish more people would protest them for all of this, but nobody is. For that, this game will continue to be crap, and when GTA 6 rolls out, that will also be crap, since they'll be copying the GTA 5 model ultimately. I blame the community almost more than I do Rockstar. I can understand their capitalistic desires after all.

Great singleplayer story, GTA Online has a large variety of things to do most which all ultimately fall short due to cheaters which are able to spawn practically any object (want to put players in a cage? sure), get other players permanently banned by flooding them with cash drops, and perform many other ridiculous things like kicking you from your own association, completely removing the ability to use it until you restart the game; griefers which are rewarded for their "ruining whatever everyone else is doing" playstyle, and even given overpowered vehicles designed specifically for that purpose; underprofitable activities and the requirements to spend millions of cash before you can access alternatives that offer a more reasonable reward; intentionally overly difficult heists which will instantly fail once a crew member leaves, to prevent you from claiming that reward; phone calls that will harass you into spending cash on properties and block your firing abilities mid-combat, that you cannot turn off, and many other greedy and unwarranted features

I enjoy GTA5 quite a bit, the singleplayer is fun, the FiveM servers can be really nice as well, but this review isn't about those.. It's about the Online aspect on Rockstar's servers, not any FiveM server at all.

The Online community is usually absolutely horrible, either people using meta vehicles like the Oppressors or using mods/hacks to get what they want.

The Online's community feels more like 1% good players, 5% griefers, 5% try-hards, and 89% hackers/modders.
Modders have far too much power in the game and Rockstar does literally nothing about it. No friends&clan-only lobbies to progress safely away from some modder who has the ability to lockup your controls, crash your game, and kill you with it claiming somebody else did it.. Even worse things than just that.
The modders are the reason an entire Discord server of 30+ people stopped playing the game, why we no longer care to actually progress, and refuse to buy SharkCards, when a modder can either just give you tons of money or reset your bank account and properties.

It makes me glad I got GTA5 for like $5, because the modders don't make the game fun anymore..

All Rockstar has to do to help entice at least some people to spend money on the game, is alloy you to progress in Friends&Clan lobbies, even if it's at a small amount less like maybe 20% less income from anything unless there's more than maybe 8 people in the lobby. If we get the ability to progress normally without being forced into public lobbies, maybe than i'll give a positive review.

Rockstar has a no questions asked ban policy and thousands of upset players who were permanently barred from online play thanks to false-positlives, discord overlays, MSI Afterburner, changing the FoV, the list goes on. Online play isn't even Grand Theft Auto anymore, it's economics simulator. You are forced to buy cars and store them in your garage instead of just stealing them, each new update brings inflation to in-game currency yet Sharkcards remain the same price. If you spend $100 on a Shark Card you can buy one vehicle and the required garage from the new update. Cannot recommend the game, Rock$tar is no longer interested in customer satisfaction, only customer churn. The latest ban-wave came literally two days before the game went on sale. Say no to predatory business practices.

Too many modders on GTA online and nothing has ever been done about it. P2P sessions instead of servers on a huge game like GTA..ridiculous.
Constantly having to change session because modders either force kick you so you go back to GTA 5 which then takes 10 minutes to get back online again or they remove you from your vehicle or put your character in a box, spaceship or other item (and the only way to remove it is to start the game again) or remove you as a CEO for 20 minutes or constantly explode stuff around you or kill everyone in the session using your name (so everyone thinks you are the cheater!) And the mod menus they use detect when you report them as a cheat and block it and force kick you from the game. And they wonder why the PC version isnt as popular anymore as the console versions.. except for the many modders who dont even have R* accounts

If you can find a way to not get banned or suspended this is a great game, but considering you can get banned/suspended just for being in the lobby with a modder (which are in most lobby's) make this awful, they also don't appeal banns or suspensions

I feel I can only write a review for GTA Online, as Grand theft Auto V has been left in the dust since it launched on PC, All of Rockstar's attention goes into GTA Online now. Buying GTA V is basically just a means of distribution for the Online component.

I'm level 99 or something like that, I feel I've played the game long enough to have a solid opinion on it, so let's begin.



- Base game hasn't recieved an update since the first weeks of launch, they don't even port Online cars to it anymore. And they have been actively taking steps to prevent people from spawning online cars in singleplayer. Looks like they don't want you trying something before you spend half a million GTAbucks on it only to find you don't like it.

- Very few of the updates have added any genuine features or changes, most of the time it's the usual combonation of a new vehicle or two, a gun that no one wants, like the antique pistol for example, and some tacky clothing options. For an online game that's technically been going for 3 years, there's been very little innovation.

- The whole point of the game is to make money so that you can buy toys, and once you've got everything you want, and once you get bored of the missions, adversary modes and races, and get tired of screwing around in freemode, the game becomes pointless, just a never ending quest to buy more and more overpriced cars and clothing for no better reason than to promote your internet ego, and then realize that everyone else in the game is driving Chrome Adders and sitting on golden Yachts

- Rockstar doesn't think when it comes to implementing game features, the bad sport system is horribly abused. More often than not I find myself getting "bad sport points" for doing nothing else but defending myself against an Armoured Kuruma full of raging teenagers who are killing everyone on sight. Do that enough and all of a sudden you're broke, and forced to play in a lobby full of dunce hatted griefers and cheaters... not that there's any difference between the dunce lobbies and the normal ones, and on the topic of cheating

- The cheating is just insane. it's out of control, Rockstar has lost whatever grip they have on this game, and usually it's not someone cheating in a competitive mode or a co-op mission, more often than not it's just straight out griefing. Getting C130s dropped on you, cars exploding for no reason, having a gang of stripper NPCs with miniguns spawned on you. And then you've also got people who spawn moneybags on others, which completely removes any reason for playing legitimately because Rockstar rarely bans, punishes or otherwise goes after anyone who gets hacked money, just the one who spawned it. They slap cheaters on the wrist, often using a strike system, the first 2 or 3 times you're caught, you get banned for a week or two. It should be permanent. There is no excuse for the amount of hacking that goes on in a game of this size

- Free roam is a toxic swamp of internet tough guys, racists, griefers, hackers, tryhards, screamers and squeakers. Freeroam was supposed to be the place where you get to show off, and play with all the things you earned during your missions, and you're extremley hard pressed to find a lobby that isn't full of hackers, Raging griefers with tanks, or one with a blood raging argument going on over voice/chat.

GTA Online is like one of the seven circles of hell, it's a circle of hell reserved for the morons and half-wits who get off to a toxic, unforgiving and completeley malicious enviornment.

It's a shame, because GTA V isn't that bad of a game, I think GTA IV was ahead of it's time, and I still enjoy it even though it doesn't run too well anymore for some reason. but GTA V has largely been forgotten since it first launched, because in this industry, if an action game isn't an online game, it's irrelevant.

GTA V: An impressive technical achievement, hit some nails on the head, missed some others compared to it's predecessors.

GTA Online: A toxic pisshole that should be avoided at all costs.

SHARK CARDS

EDIT: OK, I wrote the above review when I was really tired thinking nobody would ever see it and I found it funny at the time. However, upon people actually seeing it and criticizing a negative review of the game overall for the sole reason of shark cards, let me provide a comprehensive review of how I feel about GTA V. Skip to the end for a summary, otherwise the review will be split into an introduction, and three main sections detailing each issue I have with the state of this game.

Intro: GTA V is a good single player game. There is plenty of things to do, an engaging campaign, and a massive world to explore. My issues with this game come with GTA online. First of all, in my experience, it is very hard to have fun in GTA online unless you or a friend of yours has a significant amount of in-game money. Sure, there are heists that you can do with your friends, and "fun" activities in the forms of online lobby tasks, but this becomes bland and repetitive very quickly, more on that later. To get money, people have taken to hacking, and these hackers now populate online lobbies often. The other way of getting money is the purchase of shark cards, with your money. This microtransaction method has always bothered me to an extent, but more so recently.

The nature of GTA online is by nature very cutthroat. The game incentivizes you to sabotage other people, which already promotes a toxic community atmosphere. The people that are trying to make money legitimately (through CEO work, Biker Gang businesses, etc. rather than hacking) will often be terrorized by people in the lobby with far superior gear and vehicles. This toxicity in online lobbies has become the norm; sure, from time to time, there will be people that leave you alone but more often there will be people that kill you for no reason. And this isn't the worst part of the people in online lobbies.

HACKERS. I haven't played GTA online over the last month, but before that and presumably still now, there were hackers everywhere. In half the online lobbies that I joined, there was at least one blatant hacker there. Some hackers will just spawn money for them and their friends (a practice that is still "unethical" and "wrong", since it is stealing Rockstar's shark card revenue), which does not affect any other players directly. Others, however, will take pleasure in blowing up everyone in the lobby, their vehicles, and ruining any opportunity for fun. The hackers were one of the main things that drove me away from GTA online; why even play if there are people running around committed to ruining your fun?

This brings me to my final and largest issue; the in-game money situation and the "optional" microtransactions. Everything in the latest DLC additions is ridiculously expensive; take for example the ‚Äòfacilities‚Äô in the new Doomsday Heist DLC. The cheapest configuration costs $1.67 million and the most expensive is $5.74 million. If you were to buy these with shark cards alone, as I‚Äôm sure many have, it totals from $30 to $80 of real money. For an in-game bunker that is only one small part of the DLC additions. Some of the cars can cost $40, some of the warstock vehicles up to $90. With or without friends to play with, getting this money without the use of hacks or shark cards is extremely repetitive and relatively slow, and gets boring very quickly. This is my largest issue with the state of this game‚Äôs online. Without guns or vehicles, it is very slow to make money, and in my experience, it is very hard to have fun without a vehicle in GTA V online. The only way to get these quickly without using hacks is to spend large amounts of money on shark cards, which always has bothered me. It bothers me more as of late because of how expensive the DLC has become, it seems next to impossible to get any of it without the use of shark cards.

In conclusion, the state of GTA online is not a positive one. If you are buying GTA V for the single player, go right ahead; maybe wait for a sale, but that is up to you. But if you are buying GTA for the online? Don‚Äôt.
Thanks for reading my review

Had this since launch on PS3, have since owned it on PS4 and now PC. Only game I've ever owned on three platforms.
Managed to transfer all my progress (houses, cash etc) from PS3 character. Game looks fantastic on PC, no wonder it took so long. This isn't your average PC port. Performance is generally around 60fps on high/ultra mix with a GTX980Ti and i7 config.

To the game. Personally I'd say the campaign is worth the price alone. You control three characters, with varying degrees of likeability. Story is lengthy and fun. Lots of side missions. Great humour throughout. Solid script. Bank heists are great. Everything you expect from a classic GTA game.
To the multiplayer, where a total gem can be found. A true open-world title. You can do as much or as little as you want in the multiplayer. Feel free to just explore, or undertake in the endless number of missions available. You can even play user created games, or create your own!
Online heists were added, and although only 5 of them, they are a huge amount of fun playing. (Especially with friends) each heist requires several setup missions - all varied in nature. Heists are one of the best ways to build up currency for GTAOnline.

Why would you need currency online? Because there is literally a mountain of things to buy. 100's of cars, planes, helicopters, yachts, weapons properties. You need a lot of cash if you want to live the Los Santos high-life. Participating in jobs online also pays (though not much) this could be races, team deathmatches, stunt rides or contact missions.
PvP is also pretty well done, with mayhem potential considering some people have purchased tanks, jets and all sorts of advanced weaponry. Tip, if you're low ranked, think twice about starting trouble with any higher ranked players. If you're fed up of players C4'ing you new hypercar there is a passive mode, which means you can no longer be shot (or shoot)
There doesn't appear to be any online level cap, so you can keep advancing. Though the final unlocks for weapons happen around 120 (minigun)

My only two negatives would be -
- Modders. Modding splits a community in two. Some people love it, some hate it. GTAOnline is ravaged by modders. My opinion is that modding is fine, if on the single player, or doing random jokey things online. It can lead to hilarious moments (shoutout to the guy who spawned a coffin around my waist and seagull on my head) but equally ruins the game. Here's why - some may have no intention of harming other players, and instead throw endless money on people (probably as two-fingered salute to R*'s extortionate cash-cards you can purchase with real ¬£'s (¬£60 for $8m credits)) Great! You say. Not really. It's fine for those of you that just want to buy things with zero effort, but it leaves mission lobbies as ghost zones, noone does missions, because it's easier to beg a modder for cash. (You see this in EVERY lobby) Taking cash from modders can also get you banned from GTAOnline. So, even the good modding is bad online. Why grind a 30 minute mission for <$50k, when a modder drops $2m in 5 minutes... Sadly, this is now the mindset of most players.
Now to the bad modders. Modders who use mods for PvP purposes. This could be all your usual expected PC game hacks. Aimbots, boosted health, invincibility, teleportation etc. But it can also be so much more. Modders can literally wipe every single player with a push of a button. They can set it so players spawn, and instantly explode - leaving it impossible to quit the server unless manually shut down GTA in task manager.
They can change the rain to jumbo jets, crashing PC's as they cannot cope with the strain 100's of jumbos falling causes. Griefers can place giant blades outside apartments that destroy your vehicles the moment you leave your garage. They can drop UFO's on you when you're trying to fight, fire endless rockets out of their rocketproof cars. It's literally an endless headache playing vs modders who want to agitate the server - best option is to change servers, but most the same currently.
- Second negative is just a general lack of cool details in Los Santos. In San Andreas, if you saw a pinball machine, or a pool table, chances are you could use it. In GTAV this isn't the case. Not a massive issue, just an observation.

There is so much more I could say about the game. Overall the amount of free DLC added since launch, plus endless XP events and sales held weekly for in-game items, new game-modes. This is by far the best value for money game I've ever bought. ¬£35 is almost incredible, given the trend of charging for DLC etc. Rockstar have given it all for free.

It is getting way too unplayable/expensive/limited to play without any extra purchases. You wouldn't expect it from a game you paid. They started really well with the campaign and now they are digging their own grave.

I started a heist, one of them was afk so we didnt make it. After that i went to the gas station to buy some snacks, was kicked by modder. Tried to customize my car, someone blew me up and killed the mechanic of ls customs. I searched for another session, after waiting 10 min to join gta crashed. Got stuck in casino loading screen. Was killed by mk2. Someone in chat called me a dumbass. So yea i recommend it.

Pretty much everything that can be said has already been said - the game is fun when people play fairly, but the userbase is toxic as hell, and you have to deal with:

1) Rich people buying assloads of shark cards instead of actually earning money in the game
2) Hackers tormenting people for no reason whatsoever and RockStar doing basically nothing about it.
3) The absurd weaponry that makes it impossible for lower level players to fight back in any capacity.

Until RockStar addresses these issues (which they ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• won't) I advise you to spend your money on something else.

Edit2: Rockstar have now sent a cease and desist letter to the main modding program. It disables itself online, it has no effects for hackers, it's just for modding SP. They are trying to stop it to drive more people to Online and microtransactions. Their reason was that "OpenIV allows users to create malicious mods that allowe harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience". OpenIV does not touch online and immediately disables itself if you try. Why are people still supporting Rockstar?

Edit: These problems seem to be ocurring less by now, but I'm leaving this review up as a warning to the scummy business practices of Rockstar.
-----------------
People are being banned for no reason and Rockstar agrees with them, yet they are still refusing to reverse the bans or do anything to help. Using Discord, Fraps, Any third party Framerate counter or any program that adds an overlay to your games will result in you getting banned, and support will not reverse it. Heck, if you buy shark cards and they don't work they won't even refund you for that!
Do not support awful business practices like this. Their anti cheat is terrible and their support just wants your money.











EDIT: A lot of people seem to be taking this as "Waaaah! I got banned!", so let me clear things up. I have not been banned, I uninstalled the game myself as the hard drive space it took was massive and I didn't play it much. For those who don't believe the large amount of people who have been falsely banned, here are a few more reasons why you shouldn't support R*.

There is a limitless amount of bugs for Online. Ranging from everyone in your session suddenly leaving the game at once, you being booted for no reason, connections timing out randomly, all of these are punctuated with the worst error screen I have ever seen. Instead of presenting you with a simple "You have timed out", the game instead spends much time loading up Single player, puts you into the world, and *then* gives you an error message, with an option to rejoin. Which how ludicrously long the load times in this game are, that's a good 2-5 minutes waiting for an error to appear just so you can start waiting again to get back into the game. It is incredibly easy to fix, but rockstar still haven't because they do not care.

There is no server browser. This means that with the endless adversary modes they add, all are dead within a week. The only options you have when in an adversary mode is to invite people of a similar level (which almost never works) and to invite everyone who was in your previous free roam session. If you are playing free roam, would you want to suddenly be pulled into a small mode which likely won't have many players? I thought as much. Thus the modes die off extremely quickly.

And finally, the Anticheat is still terrible. You can have people flying around the map, spawning props locking you in place, dropping money bags on everyone (Which in an amusing way, can result in *them* getting banned) and just generally causing havoc. Every "attempt" Rockstar has made has resulted in false positives, and an extremely intolerant system towards modders. You remember how much Rockstar said they "loved" the PC Audience and their modders? That's amusing considering they're filling the game with dummy code to confuse them, and you will be instabanned if you go anywhere near Online with the slightest hint of a modification to your game files.

In all, do not support a developer who does not care about their audience. They release modes (The recent Further adventures in Finance and Felony update is a great case for this) that require either for you to grind an unreasonable amount of money, or buy shark cards to make it all easier. Not to mention the adversary modes they throw out are easy to make and take little to no effort, as again, they'll be dead within a few weeks.

You will be better off supporting another company. Move on.

story mode is great and i enjoyed it so much but not gonna lie i'm not a big fan of GTA online. don't get me wrong i think rockstar did really great job to keep online mode alive and add so much content but there are too many cheaters in gta online thanks to epic games.
overall GTA V is so fun and there is lot of things you can do in this game.

TL;DR
This review has taken on a life of its own, so simply allow me to say, that GTA 5 story mode, is expensive, given how old it is, but quite good. However, calling GTA Online trash, would be an insult to trash.
The community is toxic, it's poorly balanced, and there seem to be as many cheaters (called modders in GTA.. yeah, sure, let's call it a 'community')/griefers, as proper players.




GTA 5 on story mode, 5 years after release is pretty expensive - but excellent.
However, GTA Online is a swirling vortex of toxicity and excrement - The amount of cheaters and griefers is astounding.
I have never seen the like in any game - in fact I only have about 20 hours under my belt at the time of writing,
and I have already reported about 10 players for actively griefing
(flying around, killing with missiles, waiting for you to respawn, rinse and repeat - that seems very common)
or cheating, being unkillable (I got the Unnatural Selection achievement, because one player couldn't be killed and killed all npcs on screen, the rest of us just stood by and/or died) and killing every player in the session seems common (the latter, I just had 3 players do within 5-10 minutes of each other in the same session of 29 players)

Ironically, the cooldown on reporting players means that it wasn't possible to do before they had switched sessions to make gaming miserable for someone else.

GTA focuses heavily on multiplayer, so the vast majority of missions, heists and basically everything that's interesting is multiplayer. That can be great, but for the most part, if you aren't playing with friends, it probably won't be.
You will usually either play with someone who seems incredibly overpowered due to gear, and they'll just take care of everything while you wait or you'll get someone who is at a similar stage to yourself, but somehow seems to always have a terrible understanding of the game.

I would say that if you have plenty of money, then GTA 5 story mode is worthwhile, but don't waste your time on GTA Online, it is horrible - not because of the game (although once you have played story mode, the only pull in my view is playing with friends), it's the toxic players and that no exploit seems to have been fixed at any point, and the most toxic players also seem to be the people benefitting Rockstar Games' indifference towards exploitation.

Funny thing.. while I wrote this review, there was another cheater, who seemed to put everyone in cages (certainly put me in one), and then killed everybody once people started leaving the session. He managed to kill everybody twice before I had time to leave the session.

Update:

I can see I gave GTA online a full 30 hours more since I wrote that review, despite the repetitiveness of the quests to keep your factories going, but that time has been spent mostly loading - to be fair it's a massive world, loading taking a while should be expected.

However, I have been constantly loading because I have to leave the sessions prematurelyh due to the amount of bored, griefing cheaters. Combined just in the last 15-20 hours or so I have been killed more than 70 times by 5 players - those are just the biggest griefer I have encountered during that time, all of whom where either unkillable or damn near it (we're taking multiple RPGs to them nothing happening or very little (losing about 10 percent health by getting an RPG to the chest).

(the cooldown on reporting meant I had to let them keep killing me
(even when I ghosted their organizations they found ways to grief me out of the game, giving me max wanted level and destroying every vehicle I attempted to use, so I couldn't get away)).
Not that reporting does the slightest, but I won't let R* claim that they "can't do anything about it if the players don't report it" or something to that effect.

Anyway, game uninstalled amd I'll be seeking a refund, cause this is the worst MMORPG experience I have had. Toxic gameplay and chat, poorly balanced. a bit repetitive, expansions to the world doesn't seem to have been well-planned out, and worst of all an incredible amount of cheaters and griefers (not necessarily two-in-one, but was often the case).


Sorry, my response was too long for the comment section. So, I'll just leave it here:

@crispychickenwings

1stly, ignoring trolls or generally people who decide to come with unconstructive and/or inane comments is in my view counterproductive - if I didn't rebuke xxxanatos' comment, it would implicitly validate both their opinion and the manner in which they expressed it, indicating that it was well-reasoned and/or acceptable, which I don't believe it was in this case.
Therefore, I rebuked them, and I believe my comment, at the very least, was no more rude than the one I had received from xxxanatos.


"You do realize that you can fly around and shoot missiles without cheating right?"

I do, which is why I used it to exemplify a common tactic that griefers use to (surprise) ruin the gaming experience for others, as I already stated in my review.


"Base your review on the actual game and not your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• experiences"

I'm just one big question mark with that statement - while writing that sentence, you should at some point have realized it makes no sense when talking about a multiplayer game.

I would argue that when reviewing anything, unless it's overly technical, like a CPU, people tend to review the complete experience, not just the technical aspects, simply because it doesn't matter if GTA were the best game ever created, cause it is completely ruined by the players, and how poorly Rockstar Games manage those players.


"You can't give a detailed review with like 30 hours in the game. How many of that is story mode"

Since you insist, although I hardly see the relevance, you may also have notice that I stated that story mode is excellent, so I provided both a review of the actual game, and the elements that ruined it, and I know story mode is excellent, cause I completed in on console years ago.

I wanted to give GTA Online a shot. I played about 60 hours before quitting GTA, and about 55+ of those were in GTA Online.

" You can do [...] much more in a private online session or a session with chill people"

I had aircrafts, helo, offices, warehouses, 3 businesses, a boat, and I'm guessing around 10 cars.
I ddn't have any yachts or an oppressor, and I have no idea of how much of time was spent in sessions with "chill people", but I have done a few heists (all unsuccesful), and using the watered down "private sessions", specifically to avoid other players, kind of defies the point of a multiplayer platform doesn't it? it's like avoiding crashing your car by never driving it.

Hopefully, "chill" people were in every sessions, and it was just 1-5 cheaters/griefers that ruined the experience for one, two or all the other players, rather than every other player who wanted to ruin the gaming experiences of others.

While you seem to believe that, the amount of time I have wasted being griefed out of GTA Online, should somehow invalidate what I'm saying, which seems kind of ridiculous to me.

I would argue that the important part is that I played GTA Online for ONLY around 60 hours, and I spent what felt like the majority of that time, switching sessions because of the constant griefers and cheaters.

You should be asking yourself how, in just 60 hours, my GTA Online gaming experience could be this bad.

I mean just the amount of different situations and types of cheats/griefs I have described must indicate to you that I have experienced quite a bit of cheating/griefing, and I have experienced it all in less than 60 hours.

You shouldn't be trying to invalidate my review, because I haven't played (suffered) for long enough, you should be asking yourself:
What the hell is wrong with GTA Online, since anyone could have that many, as you said, "‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• experiences" in less than 60 hours?!


Sidenote: yes, I'm indeed regretting enabling comments..

If this game was split into two Steam hubs for the Single Player and the Multiplayer, the SP would have a 99% positive and the Multiplayer would look like No Man's Sky. It is an excellent single player game, but mimics a trash and cash-grabby freemium game for multiplayer. It seems like Rockstar only sees their players as wallets.

The lowest price this game has gone for is $30, so wait until then. When you do, just stick to single player. For a good open world multiplayer experience, head elsewhere.

Cons first, pros second.

Cons

Rockstar intentionally designed their online ecosystem to be like a cash-grabby mobile game. You are able to own property, vehicles, etc. However, you have to earn currency by playing similar grindy missions/heists or competitions. This seems great in concept, but the numbers are intentionally designed to make you feel like it would be easier to just "buy" the in-game currency with real money. Also, if you come from the single player, you get much less cash in general, so you are getting less money than you are "used to", which contributes to the aforementioned psychological pressure. Yes, you can theoretically get it all with time spent in-game, but this is similar to the League of Legends IP model in which the time spent per money acquired is so low that you are constantly pressured to just spend the real money. This sort of constant pressure does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience.

There are superfluous accounts of Rockstar refusing to appeal any bans for online play. The ban-worthy offenses include but are not limited to: using any overlays, recording software, voice chat software such as Discord, etc etc. Oh, and make sure to hell that you don't EVER mod the single player, because that'll get you banned in multiplayer too! (maybe this is why Bethesda doesn't do multiplayer?)

Let's also not mention that some hackers can appear in your public games (because you can't do these grindy missions by yourself) and just spawn money over your head. You can go jump through a bunch of hoops to try to get rid of that "hacked" cash, but even the fact that this is possible is ludicrous.

How on earth are you supposed to prepare so much for all of these detrimental nuances? No one should have to be this scared and pensive to just play multiplayer normally, but it primarily exists as a cash grab to support the "free" DLC that Rockstar releases (which you need to acquire with in-game currency, of course).

If you get banned, you will get ignored. Rockstar already made their money off of you, so who cares.

Rockstar also has a history of greed by refusing to put the game on sale during Steam sales. They instead will lump the game at the reduced price and throw the "Shark cash" in with the, so it is tough to find it below 60 bucks. You probably won't want to play multiplayer anyway.


Pros

This is one of THE best single player games I've ever played. The over-world has an astounding amount of detail and nuance, the content is ample, the characters and story are interesting, and a lot of the mechanics are fun to use. The story is surprisingly deep and is on par with a gang/mafia style movie. One of the things that Rockstar has understood about GTA is that making the driving/traversing around the world fun makes everything else fall into place, and this game is the best in the series at it. Sometimes you just want to drive around and go sight-seeing, which is extremely fun.

As a PC port, it exceeds expectations. This game is proof that it is always worth it to wait for a PC port (most recent example being Final Fantasy XV), as long as the developer makes sure to do it well. Uncapped framerate, resolutions, lots of options for optimization, etc. The rendering distance is great, and it's very easy to see most of the distinct features of a landscape at a long distance.

One of my main complaints is that hitting a high vehicle speed can make the rendering suffer a bit, but it's not a big deal.

GTAV online is pure ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

A typical use case looks like this.
Start up GTAV on my top end maxed out super desktop.
Wait 15 minutes before getting into online
It doesn't auto join sessions with friends.
Tell it to join session with friends.
Wait some more.
We try to do a heist.
Spend 20 minuites driving to get into the same area.
A guy in a flying tank at level 8000 kills us and spawns a giant UFO on us.
Get killed a few times against the invincible hacker.
Change session.
Doesn't automatically add you to session with friends.
GTAV Kicks me out to single player.
Join session with friends.
Spend 20 minutes driving to meet up. Go to so-n-so's house for a heist.
Watch ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• cinema that we have all seen like 30 times because you have to grind heists daily to make ok Money.
Start waiting room for heist.
Friend is kicked out to single player.
Need 4 players for heist.
Kicked out of heist.
Go outside to meet up again.
Dude in flying car drops $1,000,000 on friend.
Ok? Weird
Start heist for real this time.
30 minutes in, friend that recieves money is banned.
Kicked out of heist
Sigh
Lets just mess with other players and shoot cops.
Meet up again, get kicked into my own session.
Join session with friends
zooms in on the single player dude fighting with his girlfriend.

This sums up my experience. Today, I was finally the guy that had a hacker drop money on them and I earned my first ban.

‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• YOU ROCKSTAR. I am uninstalling and deleting this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

Loading Simulator. Wait 5 days, get into game, griefed by modders. Way too grindy. Fun with friends for a couple months, then all the BS starts to catch up and frustrate you.
