Thank you Sony but we want more of your games on Steam! (Ghost of Tsushima, The last of Us, God of War - UPDATE: We are getting GOD OF WAR (announced on Oct 20th) Release in January 2022, Keep them coming SONY! Spider man, Uncharted, LittleBigPlanet, Bloodborne, Twisted Metal and FF7 remake with turn-based option?)

The WORLD is breathtaking and very ambient. The world its self will suck you in with how lonely the open road is. You get that feeling of loneliness and desperation when out there. The lighting is dynamic, the soundtrack definitely give you a chilling isolated vibe when on your bike, being on foot will give you absolute silence at times which makes you want to be cautious when out there. Also the sound of folly sound great to the amount sound effects to make the game a bit more real.

EXCELLENT game with engaging story that inspires taking on more missions to unfold the narrative DRAMA, especially the tragic romance.

For those who need comparison, Days Gone does offer open world ACTION and challenges that allow the main character to grow and learn through skills and item acquisitions much like your Far Cry`s and the like. These tools are essential to pace a story and impart a level design that fosters a world of discovery and adventure. But, this is a dynamic world that changes by night, by approach, and by the world’s inhabitants. There is so much going on inside this world, just as a constant caution when exploring or carrying out formal missions. For example, in experiencing a common encampment takedown, I started off stealthy, but part way through got the attention of a horde of freakers and my hasty and finesse free escape straight through the encampment resulted in the horde clearing out the enemy. Your plan and approach can change by the second and the ongoing need to refuel your bike or gather crafting resources makes you feel vulnerable in the dangerous world.

However, it’s the STORY and the complex relationships that make this dangerous world worth the risk for Deacon to brave. The tragic LOVE story that see his purpose shift from hope to despair connects with a player who understands the meaning of what it is to have found that special person in your life...the one you will never let go of, either in life or memory. These characters are likely not the kind you identify with generally. Bend Studio didn’t make a hero that the player wants to be or makes the kind of decisions we might make. Deacon is true to his character and frustrations about wanting him to open up to his friends or react differently in a way that we might react, is a refreshing change. It supports the main idea that trust is a valuable commodity in this world and isn’t given easily. Trust is currency in Days Gone and Deacon’s wary attitude and resistance to get close to other characters is more than believable, it is appropriate. This makes each softening of Deacon’s guard with some characters so much more meaningful when those moments occur. These are the moments a player will root for and incentify the story that may evolve from those relationships. And yet, this applies to the stories of the main NPC characters as well. The high quality dialogue, music, and atmosphere continually set a mood that perfectly matches the moment to moment experience with convincing influence.

I played this on PS4 so I am glad and proud to finally play it on PC! (4K, HDR, High refresh rate)

P.S. We are getting GOD OF WAR (announced on Oct 20th) in January 2022, THANK YOU SONY, keep them coming, meanwhile I listen to God of War audio book narrated by a game designer and his son!

I've never written a review on Steam before but after seeing such a huge disconnect between my experience and that of some of the major reviewers (PCGamer for example) I felt the need to say something. I'm someone who will routinely put down an open world complete-em-all game if it is not engaging (hated AC Valhalla and thought HZD was OK for example.) I've put 30 hours+ into this and I'm excited for the next 30. This game is varied enough to keep things fresh, has a reasonably forgiving fast travel system, and has meaningful rewards for doing the optional check lists (health/ stamina upgrades, camp currency for weapon and bike upgrades, crafting recipes and a few unique weapons), all of which keep the gameplay loop entertaining. The voice acting is good, the writing is melodramatic but I'm eager to see how the story plays out. Guns are weighty and fun (although the early guns pretty much require headshots) and hordes are really fun to beat.

Main complaint is that the game waits exceedingly long to give you access to best parts of the gameplay (guns/ upgraded bike/ hordes). I had more fun in the last 10 hours than the first 20, if that gives you an idea. First game I've purchased in a while at full price and I'm very into it.

Days Gone is a hearty if familiar mix of stealthing through enemy camps, combat, upgrades and crafting, mixed with occasional bouts of running the hell away from it’s zombie hordes.

With good keyboard and mouse responsiveness, it's much easier to be precise, aim and hit the head shots of zombies and other enemies. And the adaptation really appreciated the gameplay , not being just a poorly made computer port. The feeling is just incredible, and some battles become much more fun than on consoles, as you can hit multiple headshots in a row. And the coolest thing is that, if you want to change the sensitivity to your liking or even play with the DualShock 4 controller, it's also possible within the settings.

In terms of graphics, you can play with twice the frame rate than the official release, that is, the adaptation added several graphic options that make the world even more beautiful – of course, varying from computer to computer quality. The boost in visual quality is very welcome, as Days Gone has several missions that require traveling.

The PC version also comes with all the content that was released for PlayStation 4, including the “Survivor” difficulty and Challenge Mode, which greatly increase gameplay time

With top-notch performance , you’re left with a content-rich open world title that’s unique in some of the best ways. While the gunplay can be questionable at times and the opening act is not as neat and tidy as one would hope, Days Gone still ends up being one of the better zombie shooters on the market.

THE GOOD
- Many options to tweak
- Ultrawide screen support is fantastic
- Fully customizable keybinds
- Best optimization for a PlayStation 4 port

THE BAD
- DirectX 11

8/10

SPOILER FREE
Firstly, I've owned this game on PS4 since launch. Completed it three times on PS4 and twice on PS5 so the steam "time played" isn't reflective.

That said, let's start with the bad and get it out of the way.
-When you first start out, you will feel like you bought the wrong game. You CANNOT take on the hordes you've seen in trailers (maybe if you've beaten the game, understand the mechanics, how to use the environment or you're playing on an easier difficulty). When you finally unlock your first "proper" primary weapon, the game drastically changes in pacing and what you can do/survive.


The Good
-Beautiful open world and not an Ubisoft title. You will never have to travel endlessly over boring recycled terrain, something is always around the corner. . . or hill. Missions make great use of the open world to make it feel much bigger than it really is (by no means is the world small}.
-The story and acting are obviously subjective. I won't say anything about it here except that the voice acting is top-notch.
-Game-play, nothing new or revolutionary but it does what other third person shooters still fail to do today, make the game fun.
- No in-game ads or intrusive "services". A single player game without all the modern nickel and dime schemes of most titles.
- There is an actual ending, not some final mission setting up some infinite grind collect-a-thon.

Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great story rich game.



EDIT (11/8/21): 34 hours in and I can safely say that this version of the game avoided all of the issues that it had when it originally launched on the PS4. No crashes and I haven't seen and graphical bugs either. They may exist but I haven't seen any. Game has run flawlessly so far.

Hardware: Helios 300 with 1660ti (will test on desktop with 980ti and update later)

This game is a slow burn, it builds over time. It is visually stunning and well produced. It's hard to put into words the wide range of emotions felt taking in this well produced masterpiece. If someone were to ask: if you could erase your memory of one game and play it again for the first time, what game would that be? Days Gone will always be that game. It's the only time I've ever wanted to write a thank you card to devs after playing a game.

I ran out of gas for my bike while a swarm was on my ass. I am sprinting, vaulting, sliding trough the damn trees for minutes trying to dodge the freakish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

I finally get ahead of them and hide my fat ass in a bush. Then along comes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wolf going straight for the damn swarm and does a full 180 degrees towards my stupid ass in the bush.

The wolf and me start running from the horde for minutes trough the forest again. 10/10

I'm old, been playing video games since pong came out in the 70s. I've had practically every console throughout the many years since, and so many PCs, I stopped counting. Out of decades of gaming, I personally think this is one of my top 5 games I have ever played. It just struck me right, I loved the huge environment, getting to go wherever I wanted, whenever I wanted. And the threats from just about every direction. Sam Witwer, cant say enough good about your performance. I never understood the "bad" reviews about the story and character development. The story is what kept me coming back again and again, I personally thing it worked very well. I loved every minute of the 220+ hours I have spent in this game. I even spent time obtaining every single achievment in the game. Every character I met seemed real to me, even the random encounters.

If the developers are still reading these, despite the bad reviews that seemed to be popping up out of nowhere, most of us out here enjoyed this game tremendously. Please get that sequel going!

This game got horrible reviews from initial release on the PS4, strictly because of the comparison to other masterpieces like "The Last of Us". It was/ a game that brought/brings new life to a genre that has been overly saturated in the gaming industry. Now with the PC release I truly feel this game will be given the credit it finally deserves.

Pros:
Oregon Daryl Dixon.
Bike actually controls like a bike should, has weight and speed to something that is a very heavy piece of machinery.
Even on lower difficulties the Freakers can be a serious threat if you are not prepared for the hordes at night.
I will also argue people who think Deacon is a bad protagonist, a good character is not a good person. They are troubled, and will grow through the story.

Cons:
♥♥♥♥ the instant-fail stealth missions.
Initial gun-play is horrendous and a hassle to use.
I would have liked to see a "super horde" only accessible in the end game (Old sawmill is the biggest horde of the game which must be done for the story).

Overall:
The game feels lived in, the characters have life to them and the game is absolutely gorgeous. Deacon is a Great, conflicted protagonist, who feels like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times, but that's the point, he is meant to be realistic in this hostile environment. He grows into a far more charismatic character the longer you stay with him.

I have played this on PS4, a little on PS5 and Now on PC. It looks even better and controls much better with a keyboard than I first expected(the Bike in particular). This is a very competent port.The story and characters are compelling and the graphics are top notch. The gameplay-loop is fun and has just the right amount of repetion to hook you in and just enough variety to not get stale.

Underrated gem, takes a few hours to get into a stride but once it gets there the quality of gameplay gets exponentially better. Once you can take on hordes, have an upgraded bike, and iron out your survival strategies the game becomes absolutely fantastic.

Pros
-Weapons, the Player, and his bike start out weak, but by the end of the game become strong. (Player progression is noticeable.)
-Beautiful setting, wonderful voice acting, and great immersion.
-Gameplay can go from cat and mouse, and back again depending on your preparedness.
-The main two characters in the game have fantastic chemistry and I do buy their brotherhood.
-Bike gameplay is both fun and unique, upgrading and maintaining it builds a certain attachment to it I appreciated.
-Weapon variety is great, but having more unique differentiating factors play a part would have been nice.

Neutral
-Gas management can get a bit tedious, but it is understandable.
-Certain resources are crazy abundant, while others are so rare that you may not want to part with certain consumables.
-Crafting system/ commerce is somehow both overdeveloped and bare bones. Trust system makes sense, but kinda falls on it's face when it comes to the narrative.

Cons
-Certain characters just kinda suck.
-Slow start, and could definitely trim the length.
-Early game weapons are really boring/terrible to use.
-Drip feed of content(weapons, equipment, bike parts, etc) is too slow.

Despite my gripes. I do really love this game, Deacon is a fantastic protagonist. The story is a story of loyalty, brotherhood, and staying true to what you hold dear. Not perfect, but these things rarely are. It feels bloated in some areas, and too skinny in others.

8.5/10

EDIT: I cannot believe I forgot to mention that there's a Challenge mode, and New Game+ as well as a few more extreme difficulties if you're into that. The Challenge mode gives the player a set of various scenarios to run through, from time trials, a crazy taxi style challenge, to horde and human camp clearing, there's a wide range of replayable missions here.

You can even gain rewards in the challenge mode like more efficient stamina, better healing, and faster gas fill ups by clearing them with at least a bronze medal.

Didn't get a chance to buy this on PS4, so when I saw it on steam by the recommendation of a friend I bought it. So far so good, but you're going to want to use whatever Firewall you have on your computer to block the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game the moment you install it.

The Data Collection policy is an absolute joke. This isn't just collecting Diagnostic information from your PC (something I would be absolutely okay with), it states very blatantly that even the 'Limited' data collection which is somehow still the LESS invasive form of collection can look and save literally anything from websites, passwords via recording EVERY KEY STROKE OF YOUR COMPUTER WHILE THE GAME IS RUNNING, folders, and all of their contents regardless of file type. Again, the LEAST of the ONLY 2 Data collection settings you can select before it will even allow you to start the game says that the devs can collect and save anything from your pc at their own discretion. Their reason? To make sure you aren't aimbotting... IN A COMPLETELY 100% OFFLINE EXPERIENCE GAME. Like my 8k res special occasion ♥♥♥♥ pic folder is hiding DAYS_GONE_SPINBOT_100%_ACCURACY.exe.

At least Valorant's Vanguard system is inspecting every single pixel of my pubic hair in those photos to help keep Integrity in their ONLY ONLINE COMPETITIVE game which is why it's even remotely passable.

This isn't some Tinfoil hat ♥♥♥♥, people have dead ass copy/pasted both data policies in their reviews and I thought they were embellishing to make a fuss and refund a game they didn't like, until I booted the game and saw it for myself.

What an absolutely abysmal call, and for damn sure the next time I see this kind of ♥♥♥♥ in an offline only game I will not be buying it, i'll be acquiring it by other means, there are plenty out there. ♥♥♥♥ out of here with that ♥♥♥♥.

TL;DR Fun game, worth the money, use whatever AV Firewall you have on your computer to block literally anything to do with this game to rebuke it's access to the internet or you might find your nudes on an Ad spot on Wish because it will have been claimed and sold by the Data Collection Center as they have the right to do so once you agree to the terms.

Don’t normally write reviews, mainly because I am terrible at them but here’s my quick opinion.

Game is phenomenal, really surprised me with how good it is. The world is fantastic, it runs well and jeez the characters are amazing.

The game felt like an emotional rollercoaster and it has been a while since I felt emotionally attached to game characters.

Loved every minute of it.

Currently, Days Gone has to be in my top 10 games.

Yep, there are annoying bugs/flaws (as many people have mentioned), but even so… this game is excellent. If you are looking for a dystopian zombie open world, this is it. For all its flaws, the main reasons to get this game are… the graphics, story and world design. The feeling of “end of the world, with dangerous zombies” is captured perfectly here. It is fascinating to explore all the various locations and wonder “what if this ACTUALLY happened?”.

The flaws people mention are real: The policy of the developers to invade your privacy with their data capture? Shocking, and they should be called out for it, as others have done in their negative reviews. And the other major issue is, the Quality Assurance/Playtesting – yep, it’s bad. There are so many minor gameplay gripes/flaws/issues that you are left wondering if anyone actually did any playtesting. Watch the credits - literally dozens of people playtested this? Crazy. However, the annoying bugs are not enough to stop this from being an awesome experience.

The story and acting are really well done. The main plot between the male and female leads does take a strange turn about two-thirds of the way into the game, but overall, you do get completely invested in the characters and storyline. The supporting cast is excellent, and you will want to see what happens next.

A real standout part of the gameplay is the hordes of zombies. They really are truly terrifying. It’s rare to play a game these days and feel “on edge”, but trust me, as you approach a horde of 150 of these monsters, the adrenaline will be pumping.

Respect must be paid to the music and sound effects. The creepy build of the music as a zombie gets near you, or you approach a nest of them… man, it still gives me chills.

If you can get past the flaws, you can easily spend 60+ hours on this game. If the bugs had been sorted out, Days Gone would be a universal classic.

UPDATE: I completed it for a second time, this time on “Hard II” mode. Pretty tricky, but great fun! :) I still stand by this being a great experience.

The Premise
This review contains no spoilers.
Days Gone (DG) is a third-person action-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic USA, two years after a pandemic transformed most people into monsters. Players impersonate Deacon, an ex-soldier now part of a biker gang of which, however, only he and his best friend Boozer remain. Hell-bent on finding Sarah, the love of his life, Deacon embarks on an epic, dangerous journey across the wastelands.

Quick Sum-Up
🟩 The Pros	🟥 The Cons
1. Excellent, well-narrated storyline and solid characters.

2. Overall good diversity of activities, events and missions.

3. Satisfying, weighty combat in both melee and ranged styles.

4. Large amounts of upgrades, skills and gear to unlock.

5. Fights against hordes are impressive and extremely fun.	1. Gameplay becomes stale in the long run.

2. Some quality of life issues.

3. Human enemies' AI is underwhelming.

🟨 Bugs & Other Issues	🔧 PC Specs
- Bike physics aren't always consistent.	- Ryzen 3900X
- RTX 2080Ti
- 32GB RAM

Large groups of infected, sometimes called "Hordes", are by far the greatest threat. Planning helps, but you'll still need a LOT of bullets.

In-Depth Analysis
Pros
1.
Aside from the protagonist, also most of the side-characters Deacon meets in his adventures will have distinct, believable personalities that are in line with the times and events. In general, DG aims to depict a crude, violent world that sees the worst of human nature surface out of the sheer need for survival - and does so extremely well. The reactions, dialogue inflections, even expressions of most characters are consistent, realistic throughout the game.

2.
From burning down mutant nests to eradicate infestations from whole chunks of the map, to re-activating pre-apocalypse technology or defeating bandit camps, there is a lot to do across the world. NPCs will periodically call for help in the form of quests as well, with some days having to pass between each call, in a realistic manner. Random events like summary executions to be stopped or skirmishes between factions happen quite often along the road, as well.

3.
Between the meaty feeling of smashing enemies with a baseball bat, the satisfying thumping of bullets into heads, torsos and other appendages, or limbs flying after a close encounter with a pipe bomb, each fight in Days Gone proves really fun from start to end. Deception, stealth or even turning mutants against humans in cleverly-thought-out schemes are all possible solutions, other than the classic guns-blazing approach.

4.
Deacon's arsenal, bike parts and passive skills can progressively become better, thanks to an XP-based leveling system and a reputation system in allied encampments. As one completes side-activities or quests, more and more new weapons, parts and gadgets will be unlocked to either purchase or craft. Some quest-lines give unique weapons or blueprints as well along the way or at full completion - so it's worth investing time in doing everything.

5.
A special mention needs to be done for Horde fights, where Deacon will find himself against hundreds of mutants at a time. The gameplay of such encounters is a thing onto itself, partially puzzle and partially a test of strategy. Using choke-points, narrow spaces, environmental elements like explosive barrels, distractions and a whole lot of bullets will all come together beautifully, to decide one's victory or defeat.

Cons
1.
The good variety of approaches and activities simply isn't enough to keep the game fresh all the way to the end. After about 30-35 hours at best, most players will have acquired powerful weapons, advanced bike pieces and many useful passive skills, while the mission types won't change and be always the same. Expect, for the last third of the total playtime, the gameplay to become much more repetitive and bland.

2.
From hordes not being shown on the global map until very late game, when they would be totally feasible and needed before, to the inability to save without being close to the bike or a bed, there are some annoyances that make the experience worse. The fact Survival difficulty disables fast travel, adding hours of useless filler time spent travelling "manually" to get anywhere, is a depressing design choice.

3.
Fellow humans like bandits or cultists, despite having guns, bombs and armors, prove to be much less of a threat than mutants. This mainly happens because their AI isn't exactly bright: their aim is generally subpar, the tactics suicidal, and the reaction times on the slow side. While some human enemies can be dangerous, most of them can be dispatched with a headshot before they can do anything.


Visually, Days Gone is spectacularly beautiful. A feature-rich photo mode is included, for all the screenshot enthusiasts out there.

Gameplay Breakdown

Exploration
Is performed on foot or, for long distances, with Deacon's custom bike, which will need to be periodically refueled and repaired. The world is large, and houses dozens of points of interest to uncover. Fast-travel is possible to friendly camps, however only if the bike has enough fuel, while it's disabled on Survival difficulty. Most of the world won't be accessible initially, as the main quests will need to progress in order to unlock more areas.

Combat
Is done in either melee or ranged fashion, using a good array of murder tools such as spiked baseball bats, hatchets, assault rifles, grenades, napalm and everything in-between. A well-placed headshot can dispatch all but the strongest mutants in one hit, and one the higher difficulties just a few punches from a regular mutant will be enough to bring Deacon down at least until mid-late game. Using cover against humans and their guns, while being quick and agile against melee-only mutants or animals will be the main approaches to fights. Deacon can use Focus to slow time considerably and land accurate shots, but for a very small time.

Character Management
Is performed mainly at camps and safe zones, where a gun locker to swap weapons, stalls to sell mutant parts for money and various vendors to acquire new gear, ammo and consumables are present. Deacon's bike can be heavily modded with better parts, that however just like guns and other stuff, need a certain reputation with that particular camp to be purchased. These bike mods can be vital to reach some hidden loot stashes or upgrades, or just get things done faster. The skills panel allows Deacon to spend skill points to enhance three different trees focused on ranged, melee and survival abilities.

Challenge Mode
Is a separate mode that pits Deacon against specifically-designed scenarios, with main and side objectives to complete. The better he performs, the higher the rating will be, in turn awarding cash to spend in unlock new weapons, skills and bonuses for the next challenge, in sort of a "roguelite" fashion.


Upgrading, repairing and customizing Deacon's bike will be fundamental to reach several optional areas, and take less time for traveling.

The Judgment: Very Good
Complete Ratings List here
It took me around 51 hours to complete Days Gone on Hard difficulty, while also finishing all side activities. Despite the presence of a NG+ mode, replay value is rather low. Challenge mode can give some more hours of fun, to those interested. With this amount of content and very good overall quality, I can safely say this game is worth full price purchase.

Plain and simple, if you are not a fan of open world repetitiveness, this game is not for you, the mission aren't the most original I've ever played but they aren't boring. But the core story and zombie killing is incredible. The story really keeps you in with lots of twists and turns following deacon. Hes an incredibly realistic and morally ambiguous character which fits right in with the post apocalyptic setting of this game. Beautiful landscape, terrific weapon variety and enemy type. Hordes really do feel like hordes here, very similar to world war z (zombies climbing over one another, crowding doorways and hallways, ETC.) The bike riding is satisfying and fun, feels a little icy and slippery at times but not often. Some minor bugs and a couple hard crashes in my time playing but nothing consistent or game breaking. A very nice pc port that runs well 99% of the time with the 1% just being some odd frame drops near the end of one of the last main missions and some stutters hear and there. If you are looking for a good third person action story game, with a lot of zombie killing, I highly recommend this game, if you can get it on sale, awesome, if not that's alright as well, game is definitely worth 50 to me but might not be to others.

Buy this game and help bring more PS exclusives onto Steam!!!
==========================
-I beat this game way back on PS4.
-What a treat it is to play it with more than 25 FPS!!!
-The experience is totally different and I don't have to deal with the controller or aim assist anymore.
-The game starts off slow but 5 hours in you'll be hooked.
-You can't really beat the Pacific Northwest setting.
-The story is replete with emotional tugs and pulls and you'll always get an adrenaline rush when taking down yet another horde.
-I am getting 77 FPS with the GTX 1080 Ti. I honestly expected worse so this looks like a good PC port with a plethora of settings.

Strongly recommended!!!!

Runs so smooth, feels great, I didn't see any bugs. I don't regret paying 50$ for this amazing game.
Graphics are just beautiful.
Gameplay is awesome, the key bindings fits the game.
I hope Sony releases God Of War on PC or Ghost of Tsushima.
(Note: Wow they just released GOW)

This game actually is a very pleasant surprise.

I didnt have high expecations honestly. "Yet another zombie game", "yet another PS4 port", "lol biker dude protagonist".

I'm running it on a laptop with a measily GTX1080, and yet it's still beautiful and runs smoothly. If Red Dead Redemption is a good example of what an optimized and beautiful game looks like, Days Gone follows its example.

Days Gone is what State of Decay 2 *should've* been. It's surprisingly more visceral than the previews show, and it can be a little challenging. Survival is no joke, and while a single freaker can be dispatched somewhat comfortably, the same cannot be said about 4, 5.... 20, 80. Stealth is crucial for survival, and what I thought initially would be just another zombie game, turns out to be a referance to what zombie survival games should aspire to.

A must buy.

A great open world zombie adventure, Don't believe the naysayers this game is brilliant. It has a bit of a slow burn in the opening two camps but once it opens up the story picks up pace and starts to truly shine!
The characters are really well developed and you find yourself rotting for the good guys whilst hating the villains, voice acting is superbly done especially Sam Witwer's Deacon St. John.
Oh and the gameplay - nothing truly prepares you for your first horde! its some of the those most exhilarating, frantic things I've ever had the pleasure to play. I played this trough once before on the PS4 and here I am again, if that doesn't tell you how much I dig this, then nothing will!

There is literally nothing I can say bad about this game! I've never felt as connected to a character and invested in their story as much as Deacon St.John, and will have this game ingrained in my memory for a long time in a similar way that I do with Red Dead Redemption 2 and i liked this game the same way just like how horizon zero dawn left a mark in my life for its beautiful gameplay & perfect story.

From beginning to end it is a heartwarming, gut-wrenching and epic story without compare, it's almost like I can feel everything Deacon feels all the way through, his struggles, his frustration, his pain and his joy... It all feels real in a way that no other game does.

I can't say enough good words for this masterpiece, it's almost more than just a game and in a way transcends the boundaries of what I thought possible for a game, no character is two dimensional and so I feel like I've grown a bond with everyone Deacon has and so every death hurts like it would in real life since these are more than just AI and Npcs but people, no one is there to say a cool line or deliver exposition, they are fleshed out and relatable more than even RDR2 which I thought had the most impactful characters and story before I played this.

This is the only review for a game I have made just because i loved it more than other games & this is just starting :). I implore everyone to see it through to the end and show as much love for the developers as I do since this is something more, if it were possible to sum this game up in one word it would be Hopeful, in many ways this game radiates hope from its fantastic story and it's polished world and gameplay to hope for the future of gaming and how impactful they can become.

To the developers of Days Gone: You are all amazing and I can't wait to see what you come up with next but I also would ask that you don't make a sequel to DG so the story you have created will be recognised for what it is... A one of a kind journey and one that will be remembered for it.

My Rating - 10/10

So... full disclaimer. I was raised in Oregon. I grew up as a boyscout camping in some of the very locations this game refers to on the regular. I'm very, very much biased in my opinion....

Days gone is what I've wanted from a zombie apocalypse (sorry, freaker apocalypse) game for ages. It's an open world adventure that from what I've seen is if Last of Us and Red Dead Redemption had a baby. It has it's flaws. It has it's imperfections but it left a surprising mark on my mind and that's sort of a big deal.

Days Gone is an open world zombie killing romp that takes place in Oregon. You're a bad ass biker with a heart of gold. It's a cliche but one that feels both fairly unique in a game like this and fresh. This is very much Daryl from "Walking Dead" in video game form.

Some reviews have criticized the pacing of the game and while I can see that... it's what I personally would like to see more of in video games. It's just a fleshed out world that I felt very much inspired to keep dipping back into.

For those that grew up in Oregon, btw, it's a surreal experience. It's not a picture perfect, to scale, re-creation of the state of Oregon but it's very much a love note to some of the best natural wildlife landmarks of the state. As a kid I went camping and hiking on Three Finger jack. Here I fought a nasty group of outlaws. In real life I've had several restful and relaxing stays at Belknapp hotsprings and it filled me with a giddy excitement to see it brought to digital life in this game. (with a lot more rabid zombie attackers.)

Performance wise the game is in the upper echelon of console to PC games. The graphic settings are nothing to write home about but this game performs spectacularly well. I bought this on PS4 when it release and was intrigued but turned off by the subpar performance and feel of it. On a decent PC (my setup is far from cutting edge due to how difficult it is to get a new graphics card these days) this game performs to a stellar level. High frame rates with most settings maxed out make me feel like it was worth waiting for this moment. I'm extremely happy with how well this seems to play on my setup and most people with decent computers are going to spend way less time obsessing over settings and a lot more time just enjoying the atmosphere of the game because it just performs really really well.

This game was, by far, my standout sleeper hit of the year. The location bias is real for me, but even aside from that I think this game would still be continuing to hold my attention and our current age off "what is the latest shiniest thing.." that's sort of a big deal.

This game is a must for survival action fans. The PC version of Days Gone is a solid port of a great game. It doesn’t go above and beyond by delivering anything extra, but as it is, it performs just fine. Days Gone is an excellent open world adventure. Beautiful yet bleak in equal measure, its world is a pleasure to explore – and once it gets going, its story won’t let you go.

Don’t write Days Gone off as ‘just another generic open world game’; it’s so much more than that. 10/10.

Days Gone is a lesson why you should NEVER EVER listen to, in essence, random nobody frauds calling themselves "critics".

The fact that this game is so underrated is a crime so sinister that the humanity have not invented a proper law for it yet.

This piece of art is pure brilliance.

Where other open world garbage producing studios like Ubisoft and the like shovel dirt down your throat with another save the world bull**** covered in collect-them-all stale gameplay this game tells a compelling story about undying loyalty, friendship and love wrapped in near perfect game mechanics.

Incredible journey, just incredible.

One of the best post-apocalyptic open world zombie games I have played thus far. The environments are mesmerizing, breathtaking and visually stunning. Good amount of my time was from using the in game photo-mode. The story is equally impressive with likable characters, emotional moments and some unexpected encounters. The story can feel really drawn out at times but it is worth sticking through it until the very end. The combat mechanics are satisfying regardless of what approach you take (sneaking up on unsuspecting enemies and/or gunning down enemy combatants). Plenty of weapons and skill upgrades to unlock throughout the game including having the ability to fully customize your bike. Encountering large hordes that are highly aggressive and relentless are certainly impressive. Reminds me of the hordes from Train to Busan and to experience fighting off hundreds of ravaging zombies is one of my favorite aspects of this game. Besides the main story-line, you have optional side missions to complete in each camp location which includes clearing out marauder camps/outpost, burning down infestation areas, and gaining access to Nero checkpoints to boost up your stats. Overall, Days Gone is an exceptional survival zombie game with many hours (50+) of game time with a fantastic story and satisfying combat mechanics. Highly recommended [100/10]

This is one of my favourite games. I didn't know what to expect, but it drew me in, made me fall in love with its characters, made me feel completely absorbed by its setting. That's the best thing games can do, for me: make you feel like you're there.

This is not, as some in the press have claimed, just another generic zombie game. For one thing, the Freakers are a lot more interesting and frightening than most zombies. For another, Days Gone is at its core a working-class love story. Two kinds of love, that is: love between a man and a woman, and love between two brothers. It is completely and utterly unapologetic on both fronts. There's no ironic Joss Whedon distancing here. It's about ordinary people who love each other and fight to make it through the ♥♥♥♥ the world throws at you.

As a writer, one of the things I particularly admire is that the game takes it time. By the time you reach the southern part of the map, you've gone through an entire emotional arc. You really get to spend time with the characters as they go through their lives in the apocalypse. And the characters, including your own, evolve. They make mistakes. They become better people. Crucially, they try to actually do things that make the world a better place. By the end, it feels like you've lived through something real.

The superb voice acting and excellent cutscene animations help with that, of course. And the writing itself, on a line to line level, is fantastic. So many memorable moments and characters. That it's rooted in a real place and in the lives of working-class people makes it infinitely more compelling.

Gameplay-wise, the game avoids many of the frustrating aspects of AAA open-world games. It's not a just a pretty but hollow world to walk around while you complete generic activities. One of the things I yearn for is games that make you learn to live in their world (the STALKER games do this, as does Far Cry Primal, especially at higher difficulties). I want games that make you live the fantasy of their subject matter. Days Gone is all about that: you have to take care of your motorcycle, look for fuel, watch how you move about the world, look out for hordes, etc. Yes, it can be slow and in some sense "grindy" but to me that's part of the joy. I don't mind stopping for fuel, or collecting materials so I can craft a bomb to blow up a horde with. I'm playing a biker in a terrifying apocalypse, not a superhero.

Speaking of the hordes, they are terrifying, and the fact that they move about the map adds wonderfully to the immersion. Figuring out how to deal with them, especially early on, is thrilling and rewarding.

Days Gone deserved so much better, including a sequel to carry the story forward. (But don't worry, it doesn't end in a frustrating way. It doesn't try to be "clever" by taking away the achievements of the characters with some cynical twist - it just points to the next thing the world is going to throw at them.) I rarely find games that really mean something to me anymore. Sometimes I think that I've completely lost faith in the medium. Then I find something like Days Gone and remember what amazing experiences games can be. It's probably not for everyone, but it's 100% for me.

After +60 hours gameplay, Days Gone is a really good and underappreciated game.

Despite an underwhelming first couple of hours, the game grew on me more and more as the world opened up, as I got accustomed the the gameplay loop and once I'd put a few points into slo-mo shooting. The reason for the latter is that the freakers really dodge about everywhere and it gets frustrating to miss shots and then end up in melee; the weaker, less enjoyable side of combat.

After that, it just picked up. I loved surviving out in the unforgiving world of Days Gone. I enjoyed the combination of stealth and gunplay. I enjoyed being able to switch between the two and the variety in combat situations the monsters and the bandits.

The side quests often have on-going stories for the npc's involved and they are dished out at regular intervals, meaning you can't just blow through one person's questline only to have them disappear for the rest of the game. Instead, by spreading things out, you get to catch up on them now and then as time passes in the main story, which keeps things feeling natural.

The hordes are great. Early on, they're terrifying hazards and, even late game, a force to be reckoned with but, as Deacon gets stronger and better equipped, you'll slowly start to turn the tide.

Whilst nothing Days Gone does is new or done to a level beyond anything that has come before, it does enough things well enough, with enough care and heart , for most of it to be enjoyable and varied.

The exact ebb and flow of the gameplay loop is down to you, the player, so it's great to do things as and when the mood takes you.

The main story has a surprising amount of twists and turns, even if it is sometimes uneven in quality. Most of the main npc's have strong(Iron Mike, Boozer, Rikki etc.), well-defined characters and the overall tone of the world has a good amount of moral ambiguity to it. What people have to do to survive, the decisions they have to make...the game tries to show people with all their imperfections and it's more interesting for it than a lot of what I see in games these days.

Weapons have a good amount of variety, they definitely feel different and have pros and cons meaning choosing the right ones for the right job requires at least a bit of thought. Upgrading Deke brings noticeable, satisfying and rewarding benefits.

The bike being your save point is a great idea. On harder difficulty settings, you genuinely feel vulnerable when you stash it somewhere to go explore or scavenge.

Deacon's character takes a bit of getting used to. He's a grumpy, messed up guy, but you can feel he's trying to change as he finally comes to terms with the reality that he's let this bleak world break his spirit - leaving him living a pointless life.

The way the backstory of Deacon is told is well done in terms of the segments but sometimes jarring given that it's often telling you stuff in reverse order, or simply a jumbled up order.

For example, someone close to Deacon says something really cringe worthy at one point. It's bizarre and out of character. 'What a crap bit of script', I thought. However, some time after another flashback, which goes back in time from the previous one, explains why this is. It then made sense and put a smile on my face but that doesn't change the fact that the initial flashback seemed poorly written at the time. It's an odd choice and sometimes it didn't work for me.

The map is surprisingly big as it expands 3 times from the initial area you start in. I think my first playthrough was close to 40 hours. I also appreciated the fact that after the main story is finished, there are 3-4 questlines that have one or two extra bits; to tie up loose ends with some of the npc's you've gotten to know along the way. Plus, there's an extra piece of story if you defeat all the hordes...it really set things up nicely (and ominously) for a sequel so I was very disappointed to hear Sony didn't give it the greenlight. I strongly believe it deserves a sequel, I'd love to see this concept expanded upon and made better.

GIVE US A SEQUEL SONY!!!

This is honestly one of the best single player games I've played in recent memory, let alone in the gaming market.

The setting is done beautiful and the plot is extremely well written, with characters that you'll come to like fast. There's a nice variety of locations, none of which feel they overstay their welcome.

Of course with any game, there are downfalls. The combat system is on the line of standard and awful. It'll take time getting used to how the guns work, but there isn't much variety. Rather than have a whole arsenal with each weapon having a specific purpose, the guns are basically direct upgrades of each other and there is no customization like Fallout 4 or Call Of Duty MW2019. I only used a handful of guns as they worked for all situations, and I was never incentivized to experiment with other guns. Enemies use the same guns from beginning to near the end, and only serve as a way for the player to continue fighting if they run out of ammo. You also cannot buy most throwables or melee weapons, but instead must hunt for materials to craft them. The melee system doesn't feature many weapons either, and the crafting system for them isn't explained well, if at all. You also cannot compare the stats of each melee weapon unless it's for one on the ground. At first I disliked the combat system, but eventually I got used to it.

Enemy variety is there, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. Freakers are nothing more than zombies with the typical heavy, screamer, and fast infected variants, which are very uncommon. Infected wolves and crows exist, but I never felt they were ever fun to fight. Infected children are also an enemy you have to fight sometimes, and it's exactly as messed up as it sounds. The human enemies have the basic hierarchy too, with your typical melee, ranged, heavy, sniper, and flamethrower units. The only unit I detested fighting against were snipers, as they could one shot your bike in the open world with zero warning and in the early game you won't have a sufficient ranged weapon to deal with them effectively. The AI is super basic as well and sometimes they'll just run up to you, making for an easy kill. I wish the AI would use squad tactics to actually work together and communicate to fight the player, which is rare to find in a game. The prime example of this is are the Replica squads in FEAR (2005) in which the AI communicates with each other and reacts to player actions accordingly. If a 17 year old game can do this, than any modern game should be capable of this. Seriously, watch this to see what I mean.

The highlight enemy of the game are the hordes, which is literally hundreds of Freakers that dwell in one place during the day, or roam around during the night. The most tense and exhilarating moments were when I had to fight them or sneak past them, and it's beautifully done to where no matter how big your arsenal is, you will always feel like you don't have a winning chance. Spoiler alert:  That being said, my game did crash several times while fighting hordes so lower end hardware may not be able to handle the amount of NPCs in those sections.

While the story is very well written, some of the characters fall flat. There are a few characters either mentioned or shown in the game that the game tries to force you to care about, but fails since it doesn't show the relationship and interaction between said character and Deacon. For example, (major spoiler) The story basically does "tell, not show" instead of "show, not tell" at some points, but thankfully it's not for the entire game.

Some of the missions shouldn't be cutscenes, and some of the cutscenes should've been missions. There are some flashback "missions" but they only consist of walking very slowly alongside an NPC, or a cutscene. Some of the missions in the current day are also just short cutscenes. While the flashback cutscenes and missions are shown well, there are some that would benefit from actual gameplay, and some that could've just been cutscenes.

There is a lot to explore in the game with a wide open map and good variety, but it can feel tedious. The fetch quests are generally the same, with only a few offering different experiences. They generally consist of "go here, kill everyone" but a few missions stick out because while the goal is the same, the experience while fighting for that goal is the same. I wish they did this for much more of the fetch quests rather than just a few.

While it seems that I bashed the game a lot, I feel that the strong points of the game are done so well that they outweigh the negatives. It took me about 31 hours to complete the main story with a good amount of side content, but I'm not even close to completing 100% of the game as there's a ton of side content to complete. The characters that are written strongly, that being most of them, are ones that I've come to care about and kept me interested in the story and game to see what their fate would be.

Unfortunately Sony rejected a sequel due to expectations not met on sales, which is a shame because this game deserves and has a strong potential for a sequel. I highly recommend this game, as long as you know what you're getting into.

Days Gone is a marvelous open-world RPG game in post-pandemic/apocalyptic setting with the world overrun by zombies-like creatures.

The game is a masterpiece in my opinion. Every single game aspect is at least good enough, while some are polished to perfection. The main story was very satisfying to take part in, with enough of plot twists and moments of doubt along the way. Most of the side quests were entirely unique, with repetitive ones having at least a bit of unique dialogue along the way - very close to the quality we've seen e.g. in Witcher 3 which I hold in the highest regard. The gameplay was satisfying, with bunch of items to collect and side stuff to do, the collectibles didn't make an impression of being forcefully put into the picture just to make game longer, and everything clicks together into a very enjoyable game, in already explored setting, yet with unique execution.

I've spent a good 60+ hours on exploring everything that the game has to offer and I must admit that I'm not disappointed. The game kept my attention from the first hour to the very end, and while it felt a bit tedious by the time we unlock the 2 last regions of the map, it ended in the "just right" moment to wrap everything up and not become a grinding chore.

All in all I can heavily recommend this title to everybody who is at least mildly interested in open-world RPG game in post-pandemic setting. Story-related stuff was polished to perfection and everything else tries to keep up with it by being at the very least good enough in comparison, which in my book is a recipe for a very enjoyable experience, one of the best ones I've ever had taking into comparison its potential competitors. You shouldn't be disappointed with this title, I'm pretty sure about that.

I won't go too in depth on this specifically and I'm going to keep this simple.

I've never had a game captivate me so much and kept me playing it every day until 4AM like this game has. This game (while it does obviously have some glitches here and there) is a flawless game overall. The story was great, the gameplay was amazing, and the riding is something other games should take notes for.

This is the first game I will ever give a 10/10 to. I loved every single second I put into it, and I'll definitely be going back for New Game+. Highly recommended. Support the Developers.

"♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ murderers and thieves, I can't let any of you escape. Yeah how you like that, you sons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!?"

One of the greatest games I've ever played with a masterful pc port (unlike HZD) and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love it. I should've played Days Gone years ago, when it originally released on ps4 but I'm so glad that I've finally been experiencing it with a superior version.

The brutal post apocalyptic world is amazingly done with all the Freakers, maniacs and the gorgeous Oregon. Fighting against the huge waves of Hordes is so cool and intense, gives the chills. The gameplay is addicting and I think DG has maybe the best bike riding controls.

I'm loving the story and characters so far too and Deacon has to be one of my favorite protagonists ever. I just love how he talks to himself quite often and his dialogue can be pretty funny sometimes.

*Edit*
I finished the story and WOW what a masterpiece <3... The ending made me so emotional <(T_T)>. Such a magnificent game, love story and journey! I adore the love story of Deacon and Sarah, the way it's told is amazing. Sam Witwer and Courtnee Draper did such fantastic acting in the roles.

Gameplay / Story

The action of the game begins two years after a global pandemic that has wiped out almost all life worldwide and turned millions of people into so-called "freakers". These Freakers are dumb, savage creatures who are more animals than humans, but evolve quickly and are anything but sluggish. Days Gone's protagonist is Deacon St. John, a former “outlaw” biker who lost his wife Sarah shortly after the wedding in the outbreak of the pandemic. Bitter because of the loss, he fights his way as a bounty hunter through a post-apocalyptic game world, the so-called Farewell Wilderness, which is modeled after the American state of Oregon. On his habit, St. John wears the back patch of the fictional motorcycle club Mongrel MC Farewell, with the bloody head of a chain dog on a chain as a center patch.

The player controls the protagonist Deacon St. John from a third-person perspective and deals with infected people, looters, wild animals and members of rival factions on his journey through the country. The fight against enemies takes place, among other things, with striking weapons, for example baseball bats, which, however, wear out and break over time. Firearms like pistols and machine guns are more effective. Striking weapons can be upgraded as the game progresses, and larger magazines are available for firearms. Weapons and useful items can be activated at any time, even in combat, by pressing a button using a selection wheel displayed on the screen. It is also possible - provided the player has collected enough materials in the area - to craft items in this menu and to supply the character with Molotov cocktails or healing potions.

Days Gone is an open world game that offers numerous alternatives to direct combat against opponents. A stealth approach can be used, for example, by silently infiltrating a hostile camp by cultists and using explosives to destroy the protective wall, so that freakers from the surrounding area pounce on the enemy. In addition to human opponents and the infected, the animal world of North America is particularly important a constant danger. Again and again the player is confronted with wolves, bears and infected ravens, the so-called screamers.

Only motorbikes can be used for exploring. The Deacon motorcycle is of particular importance as it is the preferred means of transport through the mostly impassable terrain. If the vehicle suffers damage, replacement parts are required for repairs, which the player collects in the area, or the damage can be repaired in a workshop. Fuel is a valuable resource that can be found all over the game world. The player can customize the two-wheeler and make it more efficient by means of different paintwork and the addition of improvements, such as a larger tank or a nitro boost.

Gameplay / Geschichte

Die Handlung des Spiels beginnt zwei Jahre nach einer globalen Pandemie, die weltweit beinahe alles Leben ausgelöscht und Millionen von Menschen in sogenannte „Freakers“ verwandelt hat. Bei diesen Freakers handelt es sich um intelligenzlose, wilde Kreaturen, die mehr Tier als Mensch sind, sich jedoch schnell weiterentwickeln und alles andere als träge sind. Protagonist von Days Gone ist Deacon St. John, ein ehemaliger „Outlaw“-Biker, der bei dem Ausbruch der Pandemie seine Ehefrau Sarah kurz nach der Hochzeit verloren hat. Wegen des Verlusts verbittert, kämpft er sich als Kopfgeldjäger durch eine postapokalyptische Spielwelt, der sogenannten Farewell-Wildnis, die landschaftlich dem amerikanischen Bundesstaat Oregon nachempfunden ist. Auf seiner Kutte trägt St. John das Backpatch (Rückenabzeichen) des fiktiven Motorradclubs Mongrel MC Farewell, mit dem blutigen Kopf eines Kettenhundes an einer Kette als Centerpatch.

Der Spieler steuert den Protagonisten Deacon St. John aus der Third-Person-Perspektive und setzt sich auf seiner Reise durch das Land unter anderem mit Infizierten, Plünderern, wilden Tieren und den Mitgliedern rivalisierender Fraktionen auseinander. Der Kampf gegen Feinde erfolgt unter anderem mit Schlagwaffen, zum Beispiel Baseballschlägern, die sich allerdings mit der Zeit abnutzen und brechen. Effektiver sind Schusswaffen wie Pistolen und Maschinengewehre. Schlagwaffen lassen sich im Verlauf des Spiels mit Verbesserungen aufwerten, für Schusswaffen gibt es größere Magazine. Waffen und nützliche Gegenstände können jederzeit, auch in den Kämpfen, per Knopfdruck über ein auf dem Bildschirm eingeblendetes Auswahlrad aktiviert werden. Zudem ist es möglich – vorausgesetzt der Spieler hat ausreichend Materialien in der Umgebung gesammelt – in diesem Menü auch Gegenstände mittels Crafting herzustellen und die Spielfigur mit Molotow-Cocktails oder Heiltränken zu versorgen.

Bei Days Gone handelt es sich um ein Open-World-Spiel, bei dem zahlreiche Alternativen zum direkten Kampf gegen die Gegner geboten werden. So kann eine Stealth-Vorgehensweise genutzt werden, indem beispielsweise ein feindliches Lager von Kultisten lautlos infiltriert und mittels Sprengsätzen der Schutzwall zerstört wird, so dass Freakers aus der näheren Umgebung sich auf die Gegner stürzen.Neben menschlichen Gegnern und den Infizierten stellt besonders die Tierwelt Nordamerikas eine stete Gefahr dar. Immer wieder wird der Spieler mit Wölfen, Bären sowie infizierten Raben, den sogenannten Schreiern, konfrontiert.

Zur Erkundung können ausschließlich Motorräder genutzt werden. Einen besonderen Stellenwert nimmt dabei das Motorrad von Deacon ein, welches als bevorzugtes Transportmittel durch das meist unwegsame Gelände dient. Erleidet das Gefährt Schaden, werden Ersatzteile zur Reparatur benötigt, die der Spieler in der Umgebung einsammelt, oder man lässt die Schäden in einer Werkstatt beheben. Treibstoff ist eine wertvolle Ressource, die überall in der Spielwelt zu finden ist. Der Spieler kann das Zweirad mittels unterschiedlicher Lackierungen und dem Anbringen von Verbesserungen, wie einem größeren Tank oder einem Nitro-Boost, individualisieren und leistungsfähiger gestalten.

Pro

+ Erkundung und Kämpfe mit Stealth-Flair
+ angenehm langsamer Spiel-Rhythmus
+ sehr wuchtige Nahkämpfe
+ toller Umfang
+ gut inszenierte Dialog-Szenen
+ Schnellreise
+ Charakterentwicklung über Werte & Fähigkeiten
+ Crafting für Bolzen, Verbände, Molotows etc.
+ viele verschiedene Waffen
+ mehrere Schwierigkeitsgrade
+ Sammlergegenstände
+ Errungenschaften

Kontra

- Defizite im KI- Verhalten humaner Gegner
- langweilige Jagdmissionen
- schwache bis primitive Darstellung von Tieren

Fazit

Days Gone bietet dir eine gute Mischung aus Erkundung, Schleichen, Kämpfen, Horror und Überleben, welches in einer wunderschönen Landschaft spielt. Klare Kaufempfehlung in diesem Genre.

This game plays like the Mad Max game on steam but with zombies and dense forests instead of a wasteland.
Better then most SP zombie games. I cant help but think that everyone in this game world must smell bad.

One of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Seriously.

It is such an incredible game from start to finish IMO. Well worth a playthrough, especially if you're looking for a different style of open world game. Completed it once on PS, and again now on PC too!

Will be starting a NG+ straight away! :D

Flawed but Great

Run, get on your bike and don't look back.

Days Gone is one of the most impactful games I have played this year with its engaging storytelling and memorable characters, you are in for a an experience that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.

When Days Gone was released for the PS4 it received a large amount of unfair criticism since the beauty of this games lies in your patience and willpower to go through the mindless hordes and terrifying factions that remind you of the most insane characters out of a Mad Max movie.

Without saying much about the story , this game sets you up in a desolated and hopeless world where it gets a lot inspirations from shows like the Walking Dead, clearly. The main character is an ex-military and motor club member before the breakout happened, accompanied by his long last brother from another mother Boozer (also club member). You join them in their long journey of survival in a open hostel world. That's all I want to say about that. One of the strongest points of this game is its storytelling along with a memorable cast of charismatic and likable characters.

Gameplay

If you are familiar with the Uncharted Series or majority of zombie-like games, you are going to fell right at home in terms of the shooting gameplay mechanics. Two things that make this game stand out is the bike tuning and bike maneuvering mechanics. This was extremely well designed, from each part you place, to custom decals and how the terrain behaves when you drive through tunnels, mountains and tight corners. You consistently have to fill the gas tank and repair the bike (will talk more about this below) which in turn makes your bike its own character in way. One of the key gameplay changing mechanics that came towards the endgame were the hordes. You are either going to love this or be so terrified to face it. I am a little bit of both.

Freakers are not Zombies

Like almost every open world game done nowadays, Days Gone isn't without its issues. Let's get this out of the way.

* The beginning of this game is painfully hard without the reason for it being hard. Example. They give you a rundown pistol with a .22 Rabbit shooter and a gas tank that doesn't get you 500 meters before going empty. I know games are supposed to have a curve but it goes from being very hard, to very easy when you get better weapons, to relatively normal by the end game. At some point it almost feels like developers wanted you to co-op with other players but gave up on that development half-way through the game. All I can tell you about this flaw, is have patience because you will be rewarded with a beautifully written story and memorable character as well as great gameplay by the end.

* I also ran into two crashes during gameplay, due to the autosave and for some reason, major framedrops by the end mission for some badly coded reason.

* This seems to be a staple in all Ps4 games but there were many render delays during cutscenes and sometimes even in the open world.

* I don't consider hordes to be bosses but I found them to relatively easy, especially the end game boss. Was a bit deflating for me to be honest when I finally got my revenge on a certain character.

Brothers for Life

Days Gone is a memorable game with a stellar cast of characters. Has its flaws but they are completely overshadowed by how engaging the story is and by the end of this journey you will be changed with the experience.

The ONLY reason if give this a BIG NO in terms of recommendation:
The absurd and intrusive data collection that can only be stopped by blocking it with a firewall.
THIS is a big no-no.

I had noted that others had mentioned the privacy policy being extreme in terms of the data sent from my machine, so I watched to see how much data was sent or received and noticed a large spike of data being sent upon closing the process that isn't consistent with "game logs" or system spec information under the "Limited Data" option. I don't like the lack of transparency so I refunded the game.

A surprisingly un-pc, relatable, and underappreciated game. Deacon is the most relatable character I've played as in a video game. He has panic attacks in firefights, you can feel his adrenaline pumping when the bullets start flying in his direction, he talks to himself due to paranoia from surviving so long in a post apocalyptic wasteland. And his denial over his wife's unknown fate really makes you feel for him if you've ever lost someone you love.

The story actually took me for a ride, no pun intended. I usually don't care about stories in video games. There is close to one hundred hours of content here. I've played through it twice so far, and will definitely play it again. The game has several difficultly levels with the highest removing your health and minimap from the HUD.

Give it a try, you may be surprised.

What a great game!

Great story, great setting, a believable open world, very good graphics and fantastic soundtrack. On top of that some of the most likeable characters in any game for a looong time (would rate them right behind the mass effect bunch), meaningful sidetasks and no DLC nonsense.

Basic gameplay loop is fun and makes sense in the context of the game setting. Zombie mechanics are perfectly implemented, loners are no thread, but a bunch of them gets challenging, and the hordes are just plain frightening and need lots of stealth and tactics to take down.

Cannot say anything bad about it, probably my favorite game of the last two years. Why this got mixed ratings by some "professional" reviewers is beyond me, either they played some other game, or they simply dont like grumpy biker dudes and zombies. So sad that no sequel is planned :(

Even before its release on PlayStation in 2019, I really loved the look of Days Gone! I was actually pretty gutted it was a PS exclusive, as I have been with a few other games too. Fortunately, Sony have been seeing a little sense lately and decided to bring some PS exclusives to PC, making their games more accessible (platform exclusives are not accessible to anybody outside of that platform and shouldn’t be winning any accessibility awards (*cough* TLOU2 *cough*)). Fortunately, one of the games that came to PC was Days Gone, which released on PC a few months ago!

I’ll start with the gameplay which, quite frankly, is nothing new or special to gaming, but don’t let that put you off! While the mechanics are all pretty standard things that most gamers will have come across before, one of the core differences with Days Gone, at least that I found, is that the various mechanics fixed together incredibly well; much better than many other open world RPGs out there. The mix of ammo and material management, weapons, melee weapon durability, level (and other) upgrades, stealth, and general timing of progression were great!

The general plot, similar to the gameplay, is, for the most part, pretty standard and predictable. However, due to the strong characters, dialogue, and storytelling, Days Gone really excelled in this area. I became incredibly connected to certain characters, and we all know that strong connections can really complement an unravelling story, leading to a whole load of emotions throughout the game! Some characters were completely lovable while others were despised! There were still a few good surprises while progressing through the story too, so it wasn’t all predictable, at least not for me. Experiences are likely to vary for many in this department. Predictability isn’t always bad though, especially when twists and turns get you doubting yourself from time to time. That actually helped pull me into the game, increasing the immersion and making me even more invested in the characters and story!

I enjoyed the soundtrack throughout the entire game, but I really fell in love with around two thirds of the way through, during a very specific scene! The songs in some of the scenes are perfectly fitting and sound amazing! They brought some real, extra emotion to the game! The general sounds throughout the game, with the environment and creatures, are mostly great too. My only criticism is with, what I assume were, crickets. I was often questioning whether there were electrical faults in game, and even with my headset at times. Other than that, the sounds were great!

The graphics were pretty great throughout, helping create a truly stunning world to explore. The only issues I had were with HDR. While HDR made the game look pretty great on my monitor, it washed out the colour in any screenshots and streams/videos. I’m someone who enjoys taking screenshots, and I’ve recently began streaming, so this was quite an issue for me. Eventually, I simply turned HDR off. It didn’t alter my personal experience all that much, but it improved the quality of screenshots and streams a lot!

As one would expect in any open world game like this, there were some bugs, but they were pretty minimal when compared to other open world games. There were a couple of bugs that required a restart of the game, another that required a save and reload for NPCs to appear, one more where the terrain failed to render and I fell through into a pit of nothingness, but that was pretty much the extent of the bugs I encountered, minus a couple of very minor ones.

Days Gone is far from perfect and certainly has its little quirks, but all the different aspects and mechanics gelled together in a rather spectacular and enjoyable way! I became super invested in the characters and story, and I had a blast while playing through the game, completing all stories, side and main, in around 50 hours. All that remains are some collectibles and challenges! I answered a question on another site that asked if Days Gone was anything like Dying Light, and I replied “No. It provides a distinctly different zombie experience”, and I stand by that. I thoroughly enjoyed playing Dying Light, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing Days Gone, despite being very different to each other.

Rating: ★★★★★

(Amazing game for people that like the Walking Dead)

============

Review:

Days Gone is an open world game with a theme similar to the Walking Dead. You will be fighting hordes of zombies.. I mean infected in this game, and other human survivors.

So if you like the Walking Dead or zombie games in general, you probably will like this game too. If you don't like games like that, then it might not be as good experience for you.

Audiovisually Days Gone is very good.

I recently played Red Dead Redemption 2, so to compare a little, Days Gone cannot quite compete with it graphically.

However, the game still looks very good and has amazing weather-effects. The world is detailed and beautiful, and I think it's awesome how the rain dynamically changes from water to slushy snow to heavy snow.

The sounds are also good, and the voice actors are very good. The music fits the game's theme extremely well, and is fairly varied. It has good rock sounds for traveling around while riding your bike, and also atmospheric horror-like music for the zombie encounters. Overall it's a very good package.

============

What about the gameplay itself?

Well it's essentially an open world game in good and bad. To compare a little more, Red Dead Redemption 2 has a lot of side-activities, but Days Gone does not.

So Days Gone is story focused and you don't have a lot of extra things to do unless you want to hunt down hordes, which are essentially different sized masses of zombies that live in certain areas. But honestly I like it this way, I got very tired with the side stuff of RDR2.

The story of the game is very good in my opinion - it's an emotional story about loss, friendship, betrayal, reunions and vengeance.

The characters of the game are well written and interesting in my opinion. The weakest link is actually the main character, which is a shame.

The main character is quite.. colorful. A tough Ex-military biker that's often quite a ♥♥♥♥, though he grows a bit softer later. Sort of reminds me of Daryl from the Walking Dead - but really dumbed down in a way. He's seriously written as stupidly aggressive and it gets tiring how he shouts that he's gonna kill everyone.

Now if you ignore the stupid things he lets out of his mouth, he's basically a biker John Rambo. Stealth, knife, traps, machine guns and explosive arrows, he has it all.

Unfortunately the game is quite buggy. Like sometimes a bike-thief comes tinkering at your bike and when you run towards him he just disappears to thin air. Or enemies that lean to a tree can fly up in the air on their own. There are other bugs too but I won't start listing them all.

So yes, it's a quite buggy game, but I didn't really care because I had such a blast playing it through. But I'm a Walking Dead fan, so I'm biased. You might not like the game setting as much, and then you'll start to pay more attention to bugs.

============

Overall, I think Days Gone is an excellent game, but it's somewhat dependent on if you like zombie games or not.

I'm biased because I like the Walking Dead and zombie games in general, so I was quite forgiving with the bugs and idiotic main character "conversations".

But I honestly like Days Gone way more than RDR2, even if the latter might be superior in some ways. It's just the setting and the story that really clicks with me, and I highly recommend Days Gone if you have similar tastes.

============

Summary:

The Good 👍
+ Looks very good
+ Amazing weather effects
+ Atmospheric Music
+ Great story
+ Great setting

The Bad 👎
- Bugs
- Main character's "conversations"

Days Gone has a very similar gameplay style to Last of Us from Sony Studios. In this game, you are a biker dude mourning for the lost of his wife during the zombie apocalypse. I highly enjoyed my time playing through the campaign and is a easy recommend if you can get it on sale.

The Good

+ THE HORDE (simply the highlight of the game - you can feel the tension everytime you face one and I've never seen any other zombie game have as much zombies chasing you as Days Gone)
+ Later part of the main story is engaging
+ The side characters are really memorable (especially The Colonel, Rikki and Weaver)
+ The graphics on this game is really good.
+ There are several locations and they each have their own charm (Thick Forest, Desert, Urban suburbia, Wasteland, etc.)

The Bad

- The voice acting of the main character is really annoying
- Story is a bit slow paced at the start (takes a while to get invested in what's happening)
- Lack of customization on the main character and weapons (you cannot customize how Deek looks and you can only extend the magazine of the guns)
- Wish there were more option on the bike (you spend 80-90% of the game on it so I wish there were more options)
- Camps are good but I wish there was more shops and options.
- JUST HEARD THAT DAYS GONE 2 WILL NOT BE HAPPENING ANYTIME SOON

All in all, I would highly recommend this game. It takes a while to get going but it is a fun journey blasting through zombie to get there.

Incredible game!

I haven't played a game that has captured my attention like this in a long time. From the story-line and the characters to the progression and unlocking of weapons and equipment. It was all such great fun.

Fingers crossed for a second game with lots more hordes and ways to beat them. You can't beat running around with a few hundred zombies dribbling down your neck trying to suck the shart out of you. Creeping into pitch black caves, squinting at the screen with a Molotov in hand ready to fire things up was another favourite moment of mine.

10/10 Game would buy twice

Wow, where to begin and what to say for this amazing game. I am sorry, experience. This is a true experience of a grim apocalyptic world of Days Gone. The setting is mesmerizing, the characters are so deep and their reactions are priceless. The combat mechanics are satisfiying and the game is fairly challenging when you go against Hordes. And Deacon St. John... What a name and what a character to get to know and play. He literally says and does everything the player wants to, as if he reads your mind and feels your heart, damn. This game is, without hesitation, 10/10.

"Days Gone is a Cinematic Masterpiece that isn't afraid to show it's flaws."
Spoiler-free review with scores & thoughts from an experienced gamer.

Days Gone. That's exactly what will happen if you manage to continue playing past the first couple hours. This 2019 game originally released with widely critical reviews, most of which pointed their attention to the game's flaws - which are plentiful. However, for every "Oof.." moment you find, there's two "F*ck yeah!" moments hiding in the shadows. With a refreshing plot not unlike 'I Am Legend', incredible cinematic cutscenes reminiscent of 'The Last of Us', an open world borrowing the dynamic music & events of 'Red Dead Redemption II', and the gameplay of.. well.. we'll get to that shortly.

Every game is unique, so I have chosen five specific categories for this review. The categories for Days Gone are: Story, Sound Design, Visuals, Gameplay, & World Design. Let's get started, sh*theads.

The Story: 9.5 / 10

You probably think I'm a mad man for scoring this category just shy of the Golden 10, but let me tell you something brother - this is a great f*cking story. Days Gone is hands-down a love story, and I'm not just talking about Deacon's search for his wife. The companionship you develop with your trusty bald-headed bestie, Boozer - is 'bromance' at it's finest. Deacon's long journey to becoming a better man in an increasingly f*cked up world is an emotional rollercoaster that's pretty fun to ride. Unraveling the Freakers’ habits and how the infection began is a whole story on it's own. Toss in the government's mysterious NERO, the psychopathic cult - The Rippers, the army wanna-be Deschutes County Militia, and all the other unmentioned groups; You've got one hell of an adventure to dive into.

The Sound Design: 9 / 10

I know, I'm handing out these high scores like they're f*cking lollipops! Cool your jets though amigo, this score is well-earned. The ambiance in this game was absolutely nailed. Every tree, every gust of wind, bird, footstep, and those damn freaker shrieks, all make you feel like you're really in the world. The motorcycle sound effects are superb. As a rider myself, it's a delight to hear everything sound so real. The changing of gears, the RPM's, and the small rocks being kicked up and 'tinging' the bike frame are as accurate as you can get. The weapon sounds are fantastic as well; nearly every gun feels beefy and righteous - with the exception of the Ruger 10/22 and shotgun shells. .22's are roided up BB guns, not .45 ACP's and reloading a shotgun sounds like someone springing a stapler. The gore sounds are gnarly, but a bit too much. Hitting someone with a buck knife sounds like I just shoved them into a wood chipper. Deacon is a TALKER. I've never known someone who talks to themselves as much as Deacon does. Granted, it's not always a bad thing. I kind of enjoyed hearing his thoughts and was pleasantly surprised when he commented on things that 99% of protagonists ignore or treat as normal. Occasionally, it'd be nice if he shut the f*ck up though.

The Visuals: 8.5 / 10

Days Gone is a beautiful game. It genuinely blows my mind how awesome this game looks and runs. My FPS dropped below 60 maybe a handful of times, and that's with everything cranked to High while mowing down a hoard of ~500 Freakers on a GTX1080. For me, the graphics truly show their "wow" factor during a sunset, or in the snowy mountains (I'm Canadian). The sun shining through the trees and reflecting off the lake during the evening hours has made me pull the bike over more than once to take it in. However, we're about to start talking about the flaws now. Visually, I don't really have any issues besides the rare surface loading delay, and Ada Tucker's oddly low-quality denim jacket. My biggest issue with Visuals, is actually the blood. You can have 500+ Freakers running at you, hundreds of bodies on screen for hours and everything on fire, with little to no performance impact - but any blood you spill disappears in ~10 seconds. Dead bodies look like they're napping and huge battles leave no trace of combat. Gruesome blood splashes on the ground, blood pools, nasty bullet wounds and brutal decapitations; all disappear after mere seconds. Extending that timer would certainly add a lot to the combat. Speaking of which.. ugh.

The Gameplay: 6 / 10

Do you remember that scene from Billy Madison where Adam Sandler just yells "YOU BLEW IT"? Well, yeah. The gameplay consists mostly of two things: Combat & Riding. Yeah, there's some crafting and "scavenging" - but it very quickly becomes just a routine instead of something to gain. We have this huge, gorgeous open-world playground with so little to offer. You won't be finding any cool weapons or bike parts. As a matter of fact, you'll be purchasing everything from camp stores. Looting is strictly crafting materials, and some NERO injectors. You can enter nearly every building in the game, and there's about zero reasons to do so. Instead, it's all locked behind story progressions and stores. What a f*cking waste of a wonderfully crafted game world. Then there's the combat. My God, the combat. It's not necessarily bad, it's just painfully generic. When it comes to fighting humans, and even Freakers, it's just the same rinse & repeat mission over and over. Almost every encounter feels like someone went "I guess that's good enough" and moved on to something else. The blood & gore from combat fades away after a few seconds and leaves behind unscathed bodies that look like they're "out" in an airsoft game. The melee combat is sh*t. Nothing is dynamic. You hit your attack key, you slide across the ground into the animation pose and your target performs the same rotation of pre-loaded reactions. Do you want to talk about the motorcycle combat? Well I sure f*cking don't, but here we go. You have a handful of biker-vs-biker encounters and if you want to shoot back - there is no free aim. You click the aim button, and Deacon weirdly locks-on to whatever and if you wait for the square to get small enough, you might land a shot. That, or you'll outrun the threat and be stuck aiming at it until you're 10 miles away. Holy sh*t. The saving grace for the gameplay is driving. God bless whoever programmed all the driving mechanics because it's perfect. There is no other game that I've driven a motorcycle in that feels as good as it does in Days Gone.

The World Design: 7 / 10

This is a difficult category to write about, because the world design is actually incredible. I’d say it’s on-par with RDR II. Every piece of the world feels hand crafted and unique. It really does feel like proper care was put into just about every area you wander into. The issue is that they didn’t capitalize on it. As mentioned in the Gameplay category, it’s a wonderfully crafted world that they somehow managed to make feel empty. There’s just little to no reason to explore off the story paths and it’s a waste of what truly is a post-collapse world. The random encounters are so bland, I eventually stopped bothering. It’s either a trap with a few weak marauders, or a really awkward survivor that needs help and will forcibly talk your ear off after you save them. What a shame.

The Overall Score: 8 / 10

Days Gone is without question, a flawed masterpiece and a great game that should have been an amazing game. With rumors beginning to circulate that Sony is reconsidering their choice not to greenlight a sequel, I dearly hope to see Deacon St. John return for a follow-up that raises the bar and answers the many questions left unanswered by the game’s ending. Thank you for reading my review!

Specs:
CPU: i7-8700K @ 5.0Ghz
GPU: GIGABYTE RTX 3080 (latest nvidia driver as of April 26, 2021)
RAM: 32GB DDR4
OS: Windows 10 Pro

Pros
-Game runs smooth with no hitches @ 4K, 90+fps and can get into 100s easily depending on the scene.
-PC controls/settings is what any PC game should strive for.
-PC's will have no problems running this game at lower resolutions. Doesn't seem that taxing and still looks beautiful. Solid PC port from a performance standpoint.
-The story will keep you playing, and the moment-to-moment gameplay will be tense depending on your survival situation (if you have enough ammo, gas, resources, etc.)

Possible Con?

-Ironically enough, controller users are reporting issues with certain buttons not working while on the bike, both xbox and Playstation controller users. If you plan to use one, beware and keep an eye on the Steam forums for this game for details.

May 19 Update: Devs just fixed a controller issue regarding steering bikes, though other users have reported issues interacting with the in-game menus, such as buying/selling/interacting with inventory wheel. Some people are just switching to the mouse/keyboard for that and then going back to controller, which you can do on the fly. Keep an eye on the Steam forums for this game for details.

A possible controller fix involves the following:
1.) Open Steam menu > click "View"
2.) Click Settings > Click Controller > General Controller Settings
3.) Try unchecking all boxes in the Controller settings, then close the window and test in-game.

Obvious Con...Data Collection

This game gives you either the option for Full or Limited Data collection.

To block this completely, use Windows Firewall to create 2 Outbound rules (Windows account needs to be a local admin).
1 for DaysGone.exe and 1 for csrsuploader.exe
Open Windows Defender Firewall
Click Advanced Settings
Click Outbound Rules > then click New Rule on the right panel
Select Program > press Next. Select "This program path" and browse to the game's location. Look for this file: "common\Days Gone\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\CRS\crs-uploader.exe”
Press Next > Select Block the Connection > select Domain/Private/Public > Next
Type a name out for the rule then Finish.
Repeat steps 3 through 6 again for the 2nd .exe. For Step 4, look for DaysGone.exe (located in "common\Days Gone\BendGame\Binaries\Win64\DaysGone.Exe"
This doesn't affect anything for the game except for outbound data collection.
Achievements are NOT hindered by this.

Conclusion
Don't hesitate to buy this at full or discounted price. There's a lot of replay value to be had. A respectable release for a console port that puts Horizon Dawn's PC launch to shame. Good job devs.

The character interactions in the cutscenes in this game felt more real to me than most TV show or movie characters. It was actually enjoyable to watch a cutscene most of the time. And the gameplay is pretty addictive once you get over your fear of running out of petrol. I was scared of freakers for a good long time before I got decent gear and realised how they worked (or didn't - they're pretty blind and deaf) and by the games end I was disappointed if a horde wasn't very big.

A lot of games I play I feel towards the end that they should have finished 10 hours ago but this one I wanted to keep going. It has bugs and weird things but it's so much fun I can forgive my character yelling at the top of his voice about the latest Copeland radio sound bite whilst I try to sneak up on some freakers and they don't hear me.

It's a solidly fun game made by a team that understand how to entertain a player whilst telling a heartfelt story.

Another game I fully enjoyed from ps4 comes to PC and its right time to purchase and play in 4k.... Well guess what.
Refunded due to the very intrusive data collection and DRM the game forces you to accept. There is no way to not accept it, and you are forced into playing with a key logger attached that is active regardless if the game is active or not THIS INCLUDES VISITED WEBSITES. This is the same thing that made me refund Horizon Zero Dawn

These are just part of the terms you have to accept. And this is just from their "limited" option. (I have also taken screenshots of theses terms to show just how blatant they are, but I have no clue how to attach them to a review.)

Network Data: Information about your device's network connections (such as mobile, Ethernet, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) including IP address and the number, requirements and speed of the connections.

Configuration Data: Information about your device's configuration, such as the manufacturer, model, number of processors, display size and resolution, date, region, language, locale and capabilities.

Security Data: Information necessary to detect and investigate malicious, unauthorized or fraudulent activities.

Legal Data: Information required by applicable law and to demonstrate compliance.

Again this is stated to squash bugs.. You have a crash log for that and I should be albe to opt in or out of sharing that info.

Im seeing a pattern with the Sony games and these are the most intrusive, albeit not hidden in a wall of text, things I have ever seen. AGAIN I would reconsider buying it if you could disable all data collection but until then I will reallocate my funds to yet again a different game.

I believe (will confirm later) this game was also ported by Chinese developers (Virtuos) so if you know the stigma surrounding these (Chinese) companies such as Tencent you know it is all about selling data, that should tell you all you need to know.

First off this was a very good port for a PlayStation studios game on PC, compared to Horizon and the Quantic Dream games. Game looked absolutely beautiful and it played smooth like butter, even in bigger areas with more NPCs like the camps. My favorite thing about this game is probably just driving around on the bike while listening to a podcast, being ambushed by snipers, lines that I don't notice until it's too late and just looking at the forests, mountains, rain, snow. Story was great, I really enjoyed it, all the characters felt fleshed out, seemed to have a reason to do whatever they do and it felt very realistic in an apocalypse. The voice actors did a 10/10 job, especially the main character Deacon who I sympathised with a lot. All villains had some sort of morality, even Skizzo who I absolutely hated, I understood his motives for what he did.

This was personally my 2021 GOTY. The story starts a bit slow and some of the first minor characters you meet and not the best representation of the game. Give it some time and you will find a top tier story, satisfying gameplay, amazing visuals, an overall solid port.

Pros

+ Deep shaded characters of grey. People act human in a post freaker world. None of the characters in Days Gone are the default virtuous characters. Everybody has problems, makes mistakes and it does a great job fleshing out the characters. Combine that with a solid narrative and you have an amazing story.
+Solid gameplay loop with satisfying upgrades all through the game. Plus, the excitement of battling hordes of freakers and pulling off a victory is such a fun accomplishment.
+Challenge Mode – an additional gameplay mode that can add hours to your playtime and some of the rewards transfer over to the story mode.

Cons

- As stated before, the game starts a bit slow (multiple hours) before ramping up into the great game that it is.

Ride with me, brother

Please allow me to start with something that I find particularly amazing, at the moment of this review it is confirmed by Sony that a whole “slate of games” will be arriving to the PC within the near future, of course I don’t know what the future will bring us but I find fascinating how this sounds incredible now, how it would have sounded like madness in the past and how it will probably sound normalized in the future, just another example of how much the industry changes, right? Well, let’s get to the point, this “slate of games” has started with Days Gone, perhaps not a game you are familiar with but I think it will be interesting to review, is it good? Is it worth your time? Let’s find out.

Two years ago an unknown disease spread all over the world turning people into strange bloodthirsty creatures that ran rampant on the streets killing everyone and everything. Somehow you, your wife and your best friend survived the apocalypse only to be stuck in a nightmarish world. We are Deacon St. John, an outlaw rider who has survived alongside Boozer, your brother from another mother, doing jobs for the few survivalist camps that are all over this wild land that is Oregon. Our duo gets attacked by a faction called the “Rippers” and that will start the plot-line that will drive us to unexpected places, ghosts from the past, broken alliances waiting to be fixed and new enemies that were born in this hostile world.

Days Gone might not sound exciting at all if you just read this, however, let me tell you that this is in fact a very nice story divided in multiple narrative arcs, more specifically in different plot-lines that you will be completing by doing not only the main missions but also side-quests, clearing the infected areas or doing specific challenges, is this important? Well, I would say it really depends, some narrative arcs are deeper than others, by doing some of them you will see how characters evolve or expand their own backgrounds, how some elements from the world change by your own actions or just discover tidbits of what could come next.

If you ask me how would I describe this game I would probably answer “It’s a mix between Sons of Anarchy and The Walking Dead” because all the elements of this game are a mix of a very specific biker culture scene immerse in the middle of a broken world by an unknown pandemic that turned most of the world into a warzone. You can clearly see how all the characters are under a very specific stereotype by their behaviour, their culture or just the way they act, not going to lie, at first I thought characters like Deacon or Boozer were quite flat but the more you progress in the story, the more interesting they become, at the end of this adventure I really appreciated the work they did for all the characters and that’s something that I’m glad I discovered here.

Not everything can be good so here comes my biggest complaint about the narrative of this game is pacing. I don’t know if you will feel the same I felt while playing but it’s quite strange to see that game’s climax happens, like, 10 hours prior to the real ending, when a narrative plot-line gets forgotten until 20 hours later a new mission pops-up or perhaps when the Horde mechanic gets introduced and it doesn’t appear in the story line until almost the ending and they abuse it. If the team had to change something I would totally say this is the thing that should be revised.

Is it a problem? At a personal level it wasn’t a problem but I’m sure some of you will find this a bit too dense, you know what else is dense but this time for good? The world.

I don’t think I’m mistaken if I say that Days Gone is a beautiful game, this apocalyptic version of Oregon with the small towns destroyed and abandoned, the roads full of forgotten vehicles or the grim aura of the NERO camps is something that they truly nailed. Something that you might find interesting is the similarities with another Sony IP, The Last of Us. I don’t know if they confirmed this game was an inspiration for them but it really seems to be this way as you will encounter specific scenes, situations and tonalities that are very similar to this game.

Nature here is absolutely stunning with very distinct biomes, from dense forests to gelid tundras, all the weather elements will interact to some degree with you and how you play, affecting not only how the freakers interact but also how you drive, fight or explore. I really recommend you to take your time exploring and be amazed by some moments this game will throw at you, from a foggy lake with a great sunny day to a rainy day with a horde going after you, quite impressive if you ask me.

Of course being a looker is important for this kind of game but gameplay is the key here, oh well, what should I say first? The bike.

The most important element of this game would be without any doubt the bike, not only part of your character’s identity but also your vehicle. It is completely customizable to the point it has some really crazy and visually stunning details, it will be ESSENTIAL to upgrade your bike to get a better performance, to save some gas or get a better durability, based on your bike you will find yourself changing your routes in order to get some gas or traverse a safer place, its systems are not difficult to understand and its control is really well done, this control will change alongside your upgrades, some will be more noticeable than others.

Your character will also be upgradeable and it’s important to keep a balance between your skills because in the same way as it happens with the bike, it changes quite a bit but in the base level you can already see that gunplay for example is really well done with a weight sense or impact force in the bodies, your stamina, focus and health will improve too but keep in mind you will need to find NERO injectors, choose wisely.

I played the game with KB+M and I must say the controls are excellent, not only is the bike really well adapted but also your gun’s precision will improve or make it easy to target objectives. Which reminds me about the most interesting mechanic of this game, the hordes, trust me when I say that the first few times you see one you will sweat a bit as they are something BRUTAL, imagine 100 or 200 freakers running at you and you have to kill every single one of them, manage your resources well because it will get harder the closer you get to the end, a lot of potential with this mechanic with stunning visuals.

Speaking of PC specifics, what about the port? It is a really good conversion.

I can only speak for myself but while I had a very good experience with HZD at release a lot of people didn’t in this case however, while once again I had a great experience people seem to agree that the PC port is really well done. Tons of PC options were added, framerate was uncapped (I recommend to cap them at your max refresh rate so your GPU doesn’t go crazy) and yeah, this game hasn’t looked any better than right now.

If you want to jump in you will probably find yourself having a good experience or at least I hope so.

So what’s the deal then? Days Gone might not be the port you were expecting from Sony but it sure is a very solid and notable game, Bend Studio did their best here and while some things could have been better, they really nailed some others.

It took me 35 hours to finish the story and some of the side content and there was only one moment around the ending in which I was a bit burned out due to one element that was abused but the rest? It was a great experience that I enjoyed and I wouldn’t doubt recommending to anyone who enjoys open world games, zombies and exploration, in fact, if you don’t know a lot about this game, I would encourage you to stay that way until you play it to discover everything by yourself.

I really hope this review was helpful for you and I sincerely hope you enjoy this game as much as I did.

Days Gone is a bit of a mixed bag, and largely falls into the same realm as Dying Light: an alright story propped up by more engaging gameplay mechanics.

Right off the bat, the story falls back onto tried-and-true tropes of zombie fiction. Nothing I've seen thus far has particularly struck me as unique or interesting, though it's supported by decent voice acting and animating. The worldbuilding is still rather generic, and I think it's one of the weaker elements of the game.

I'm not fond of the oft-repeated bleak and dreary post-apocalyptic setting, making Days Gone's setting of Oregon a unique departure from the average post-apocalyptic world. The map is sprawling with unique and vibrant natural environments which are juxtaposed to the ruins of a lost world, and though random encounters are sadly quite sparse and generic, its emptiness is part of its charm. Despite my expectations, quite a lot of the map's buildings are fully explorable, and the variety in terrain keeps the world consistently fresh.

Whilst I do feel that the gameplay is largely run-of-the-mill (think slow motion aim ala Horizon Zero Dawn, resource scavenging ala Dying Light, bandit camps ala Assassin's Creed games, a detective mode ala the Arkham Batman games, generic firearm gameplay, and clunky melee combat), there's nothing in the zombie genre like the horde mechanics. They're a phenomenal, exhilarating, and terrifying presence that constantly keep you on your feet and plotting how not to end up a human happy meal. The resource scarcity forces you to lay traps and wisely decide how best to approach these situations, and it's really where the more generic elements of the gameplay fall to the wayside as you desperately try to deal with eighty billion zombies attempting to suplex you into an early grave. In much the same way that the parkour and pursuit mechanics made up for the more generic gameplay mechanics of Dying Light, the horde mechanic is far and away where Days Gone distinguishes itself. The bike's ok too.

At the time of writing, I'm twenty hours into the game and have experienced a number of bugs -- mostly physics related, one graphical, and two that forced checkpoint restarts -- but overall performance has been smooth, and I've encountered no significant issues.

Whether or not Days Gone is worth playing is dependent on what you want out of a game. If you're after something that's pure and simply entertaining, it's 100% worth a buy. If you're after a complex, living world with a moving story, maybe look elsewhere or pick it up when it's discounted.

As someone who grew up with Syphon Filter (Bend Studio first series) I was excited hearing that Days Gone was finally coming to PC. My expectations were very high and I'm happy to say the final result didn't disappoint me. However, the game is a bit rough around the edges and the narration is quite atypical for a open world action adventure game.

Speaking about the narration, it's like the whole first half of the game is a huge, slow, tutorial where you get to know Deacon St. John personal tragedy and what remains of a post-apocalyptic Oregon. It mostly consists in learning the gameplay basics, introducing side characters by doing errands for their camps and knowing more about the state of the world and the nature of freakers (infected humans). It's a great intro, but again, it takes so long that after 20 hours I still couldn't understand where the story was going.

The second half is where the whole story is condensed. Narration becomes faster, action-packed, with many new characters popping up and missions becoming more interesting. By completing them, Deacon has access to better weapons and blueprints that finally make him capable of fighting huge hordes of freakers. Then a sort of b-movie ending comes out of nowhere, which is not what I expected after a long realistic ride. Once the credits roll the game continues with a couple of missions that close some story arcs and a secret ending that confirms a possible far more interesting sequel.

For better or worse, it's an atypical form of narration. It works, but I can't say everyone will remain engaged to see the second half of the game and that's probably why the game has been so underrated on console. It's disappointing to hear that Sony didn't want to fund a sequel, but understandable. The game has many flaws (particularly on the narrative side), even if the premise of a sequel is great and would give a proper ending to Deacon's story.

Unlike The Last of Us, the story of Days Gone doesn't have the maturity to depict human relationships in a more interior and natural way. Its romanticism in a post-apocalyptic world feels superficial, forced and often out of context. While the well written realistic dialogues make characters look alive (also thanks to some incredible facial animations), their behaviour during some important moments contradict them. At the end the only one who stays true to himself is Deacon St. John, whose characterization is great, despite looking more like a romantic Daryl Dixon.

Some other narrative minor flaws:

- Violence is somehow softened during cutscenes, with things often happening out of screen (like someone's arm getting chopped off). Same goes for sexual content which is basically non-existent.
- Deacon and Boozer always talk about their mentor, Jack, but he is nowhere to be seen, not even during flashbacks, which make those intimate moments meaningless.
- Everyone rides bikes only. While it makes sense for a old gang of bikers, it doesn't for everyone else, also considering the world is full of gasoline and it's never clearly explained why they don't use other vehicles.
- Random/secondary NPCs sound boring with zero facial animations and repetitive dialogues.
- The part showed at the E3 2016 Sony conference was 100% scripted, as it plays very differently, they never reach the sawmill roof, no cutscenes and the horde doesn't get involved (unless you want it).

Now the gameplay is a dream come true for survival game lovers. No, you won't need to find food and water like in State of Decay, but you will need to find other resources that you can use for crafting weapons and healing items. You will also need to find gasoline when your bike runs out of fuel or scraps when you will need to repair it. These basic survival aspects fit really well with what is the main focus of the game: exploration. The Oregon map is huge and it contains many locations, points of interest, side activities, collectables and random events. Everything rewards Deacon with experience (used to unlock active and passive abilities) and increases the reputation of the nearby survivor camp (which unlocks more weapons and bike upgrades). Some activities will inevitably become boring on the long run (especially random events), so my suggestion is to simply focus on the story and complete the activies near your main quest location. By doing so you will also unlock fast travel positions that will be really helpful later on when you will need to revisit the same locations.

Combat is generally good, lot of different weapons to choose from and using covers is required against other humans, though stealth is always the preferable approach. Their camps are typically well guarded by hidden traps and snipers, but there are always multiple options to sneak in and it's even possible to divert freakers into enemy camps. Stealth is also suggested for freakers, as shooting usually attracts more of them. Hordes need more like a run and gun tactic and can be extremely fun if you make a good use of the surrounding area (explosive barrels, traps, blockable paths). There are many hordes and they will all be marked on the map at the end of the game when you will be strong enough to take them out easily. Every horde has basically three spawn locations depending on the time of the day. They hate light, so during the day most of them will hibernate inside dark caves, trains and other buildings, while they will roam around during the night.

AI can be quite disappointing. While freakers only run after you, human enemies often look at the wrong direction, casually shoot with their bad aims, or have suicidal tendencies running at you with a melee weapon. This makes hard mode look more like normal mode, though Deacon can only survive a few attacks (but it's really easy to craft bandages).

Riding the bike feels great, you can customize it with skins and upgrades and also need to take good care of it. Once it's broken you need to fix it using scraps, but if you don't have any you will need to explore on foot and gather some. This only occured a few times to me and definitely increased the tension, especially at the beginning of the game when I was more vulnerable.

The game graphics are insanely good. I never visited Oregon, but it really feels like being there. The level design is detailed, coherent and believable, with so many explorable interiors. The facial animations for main characters are stunning, unfortunately I can't say the same for side characters and random NPCs. What I was negatively surprised about is that every cutscene fades to black, while many AAA games nowadays are able to move smoothly between cutscenes and gameplay. Anyway it's a minor issue that didn't affect my experience.

The PC port is solid. Great performance overall with only a few bugs mostly related to physics and some NPCs glitches (such as freakers trapped underground). The last update unfortunately made my game crash quite a lot, but I'm sure is going to be fixed.

Soundtrack: nothing memorable and they basically use the same three soundtracks for the whole game (exploring main soundtrack, combat soundtrack and stealth soundtrack), which is quite meh. Rest of the sound effects is ok, bike engine, gun shots, fire and explosions all have decent sounds. Voice overs are actually great, the only issue is Deacon speaking to himself all the time and picking the wrong lines, like talking about clearing a freakers nest that you already cleared. Yep, that kills the mood.

In conclusion, Days Gone is a great open world game, with an incredible level design and many great ideas that are only affected by a weird pacing and a sense of repetitiveness that will inevitably appear. The game is maybe too long for what the story has to offer, but I would still suggest to buy a ticket for this enjoyable ride.

This is it.

This right here is a crowning example of a fantastic PC port. Such attention, such love went into porting this over to our platform, guys. You can feel it from the moment you get into the game.

Not a single hitch anywhere to be found. Options out the a$$. Everything we need as PC gamers to tweak is there, and you may not even want or need to tweak anything because this work of art runs flawlessly on hardware two gens old. My specs are available on my profile page (click More). Suffice it to say, a GTX 1080 running the game at 1080p never dips below 75 FPS with most settings maxed out, and a lot of the time, while just exploring, I'm maxed out at my monitor's refresh rate (144).

I don't know much at all about the story yet, but I don't tend to pass judgment on a game based on it. It's about the gameplay for me, and I'm of the belief that stories are subjective. We all enjoy certain stories for certain reasons, and no one feels the same about any story as the next person. So far, I'm engaged. I like the characters already. That's enough for me.

As for how it feels on PC: it goes down like smooth whiskey -- there's plenty to appreciate as it goes down, and everything is executed so smoothly it leaves you with a pleasant little buzz almost immediately. Animations are smooth. Transitions between animations are natural. Gunplay is snappy with mouse/keyboard, and I haven't felt like I need to compensate for bad control design. Deacon sprints, climbs, rolls, and enters combat just like your movie heroes do: realistically, with nary a hint that you're only playing a game.

I'd like to thank these guys for this port.

Thank you so much, Bend Studio, for taking us seriously. We PC gamers are so tired of half-a$$ed ports aiming to take our money for little effort. You put in the hours, and you made sure the product was ready. And so you have our gratitude, and our positive Steam reviews, and our money. You deserve all the praise you get now and in the future.

The gods of the PC Master Race rejoice this day.

May Bend Studio live long and prosper.

Amen.

Days Gone
Days Gone is an open-world action-adventure game that is set in a post pandemic America.

Story

The player controls Deacon St. John – a biker that is trying to survive in this post pandemic world. After Deacon and Boozer get out of some trouble, Deacon makes a discovery that re-ignites his hope of finding his wife, that he put on a NERO rescue helicopter roughly two years ago.

While trying to find more information about his wife, Deacon helps camps to survive and does jobs for them which lead him back to old friends but also lets him discover some things he thought he let in the past.

Personal Note

Days Gone is one of those games that start quite slow but get better over time – I was fully aware of that when I started playing and appreciated that I had to think about committing to some fights against freaks or humans and to juggle some resources that are somewhat crucial throughout the entire game.

This game has an interesting take on the whole zombie virus thing that we have seen a bunch of times already and makes those zombies, or freaks, more interesting and more dangerous as soon as they form to a horde. The game mostly uses its storyline system and dialogue to give the player important information and bits of lore about groups, the past as well as freaks.

Throughout the game the player will follow multiple storylines that guide them through the game. There are main storylines and side storylines that the player can do whenever they want. Most of the side content just helps you to unlock better parts for your bike as well as better equipment and weapons – which is quite important. The main story, as the name implies, just pushes the player forward while giving the player enough time to do everything they want like exploring or fighting hordes, getting rid of ambush camps, hunt for collectibles and so on.

Earning trust in each camp can be a bit repetitive and the progress slows down a bit towards rank 3, which is the highest rank in each camp. Naturally you increase trust through main and side missions as well as through optional things like killing hordes, going after NERO checkpoints, clearing ambush camps and rescue people on the road. You can also sell stuff to merchants to increase trust with the camps.

Fighting freaks in general is not that big of a challenge, especially whenever you get better weapons and such, but fighting a horde can be quite challenging especially in the early stages of the game. One of the main features of Days Gone are the hordes of freaks and I think they did a pretty good job with that.

The story of Days Gone is pretty good. The only thing that kind of confused me at the beginning was the way it is being told, which is tied to the multiple storylines that get progress bit by bit until the end. I like the idea of that, it’s just a tiny bit confusing for the first hour or so.

Fighting zombie hordes feels good
Unique-ish setting
Great atmosphere
Good photo mode
Cons
Gaining trust is repetitive-ish
Minor non game breaking bugs
Conclusion

Is Days Gone worth your time and money? Honestly it is.

Days Gone is more than a decent PC port and it offers a good story, believable characters, interesting lore and zombie hordes – so, what more do you want?

The game setting itself is unique enough to give it a try: Former biker that tries to find answers about his wife whereabouts while having its own struggles due own morals and constantly drifting around between camps that struggle to survive.

I would love to see a Days Gone 2 at some point.

8.7 / 10

Alright i didn't finish the game yet, but i think i am ready to provide "My Review" to you all because i really having a good time with it,
this game totally gave me a sentiment of "Anarchy World"
i would like you to try to imagine
SOA (Sons of Anarchy TV series ran from 2008 to 2014) The Walking Dead (TV series
running from 2010 til 2022) and Mad Max (2015 Video Game)
mix together then it will appear to the vibe of this game while you playing it
and graphic of this game are gorgeous, they took place in USA Oregon (my apology in advance if i spell or interpret something wrong about the region, because i am just a foreigner who never visit there) but damn it's beautiful,
and one more thing i want to mention is port and optimization of this game are solid, game run so smooth, also you could play comfortably with both M+K or Game Pad

and one last thing please don't consider this game as "Masterpiece" or some called "AAA" game something like that, because this game is not perfect but it's one of the great job in term of video games

about the full price it's make sense, but if you can't afford just wait for steam sale, and also i believe you all know the alternative way to buy the game legitimately,

that's all i could provide you, my gamer comrades, now it's your turn to choose,

wish you all have a good day (at least try to make it) in this situation of our world

Update : i just finished the game yesterday, nothing about my opinion change, awesome game!

Seeya!

Really good open world post-apocalyptic game, story is good but slow paced, at the end the game drags a bit. Gunplay feels alright, and bike controls feel tight and controls differently with weather and asphalt conditions which is pretty cool.

Performance is really good and only found minor bugs (2) that were fixed with a reboot of the game or reloading a checkpoint.

Totally worth checking out if you like open world games with a post apocalyptic vibe.

GREAT GAME, BUT PRIVACY POLICY IS WAAAAY TOO CRAZY. LITERALLY SAYS THEY CAN SEARCH YOUR WHOLE COMPUTER AND COLLECT YOUR DATA. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP IN A PRoNHUB AD, USE A FIREWALL AND BLOCK THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF THIS GAME. GET IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!

Edit: To all you Timmies getting sand in your pink tacos over my review, It's my opinion. I paid Full Price for this game, and I'm entitled to it. I don't know who any of you are and it makes me feel great that people I don't know are popping veins over my review. Go eat a big fat pickle!

Edit 2: It's freakin hilarious how all the lemmings giving me crap below either don't own this game or have their profiles set to "private". READ THE LEGAL POLICY FOR YOURSELF HERE. (*-)playstation.com/en-us/legal/privacy-policy/(-*)

Edit 3: I never said it wasn't a good game, I said that the lack of privacy is bull puckey! Also, saying that "Well, the policy is normal" is like the Germans with the Jews and Jews telling each other "Relax! the Stars of David are standard for getting food, it's totally normal. Put down your tinfoil hats and get in line!" If we're wrong, no big deal. But if you're wrong, then yes, VERY BIG DEAL. Ironic that in the game, the people left are the ones that were thinking of these things pre-disaster.

Edit 4: For all you lemmings that are STILL defending a billion dollar company, please check your data spikes when you exit the game. The amount of data sent to Sony when you log out is monstrous and is much bigger than just your gameplay data. Don't be so stupid.

The somewhat overlooked "everything's gone to hell" zombie apocalypse game that originally released for the PS4 on 2019 is finally on PC and it's the way to play this masterpiece.

To first get this out of the way: The game ran like a** on the PS4 and load times were horrible. Thankfully, thanks to PC master race and SSD, loading times are much, much better. Frame rates are now also 60+, featuring unlocked options - provided you have the omph to do so.

From the graphics settings, to the extremely well done voice work, world building and map design, Days Gone is a masterpiece. It's brutal, unforgiving and definitely loves to pit you against horrible odds - and that's what makes it different. After sending away your wife on a rescue helicopter that only had room for 2 more, and you were 3, you decide to stay behind with your brother. You play as Deacon, and meet up with those two, 2 years after the incident where the story picks up. The game starts with a bang, straight onto a motorcycle chase and...well the rest you'll have to find out for yourself.

On harder difficulties you're left with a barren hud, fast-travel is disabled and supplies are more limited. To me, that's how apocalypse games are supposed to be played. Since you, for a good portion in the beginning at least, have to walk from location to location, having almost no supplies and running through forests that swarm with zombies (called freaks) and wildlife that would have you for lunch, is no shorter than scary and very immersive. The game does a very solid work of putting tension where it should, through walkie-talkie communications and other events you discover as you walk/run about.

Of course, you're not stealthing all the time, so for those times things go loud you need proper equipment. Crafting is a big part here, made by things you scavenge. For whatever thing you need, you can bet your horse they're either in short demand or expensive as all hell to buy. Knowing when to run and when to gun are decisions you must take while thinking on your feet - because freaks seldom run around alone. Thankfully you'll eventually get bikes to navigate around, but they don't run on air. Free roam too carelessly around and you'll find yourself in the middle of nowhere with an empty gas tank and neighbours that want your bike, equipment and your life.

Days Gone checks all the boxes here for what I deem a proper survival zombie apocalypse game, and that feeling feels cemented even after some hours in. The setting and scenery are gorgeous and haunting, the weather system adds interesting effects to the land (torrential rain = mud = you slide around like a soap in a bath tub) and the explorational element adds to one of the genre's best. The game also features one of the absolutely best real time graphics settings screens I've seen.

If you like zombies, survival, exploration, an exciting story and very solid voice work, this should be on your short list.

Edit: Here's a Twitch Stream[www.twitch.tv] I did some time back showcasing how the game is on hardest difficulty.

This takes the best elements from some of my favorite zombie / infection films and games.

Love the overall atmosphere and the constant feel of dread.

It would be like if "Ride with Norman Reedus" was filmed in the apocalypse XD

It's really hard to put this down once you start playing. It is that good. Kind of like playing Dead Rising for the first time this is unique in every way.

There isn't anything quite like this which I love. Photomode is also the best I've seen in awhile.

The survival aspects aren't too forced which is something I don't usually like but it works here almost seamlessly.

It's cool to see Sam Witwer in another game again. Makes me feel like I'm playing The Force Unleashed at times.

There are plenty of mods too which is cool. I can run around as Hunk from Resident Evil.

This is the ideal sale price and it's def worth getting now. It pays off to be patient.

Days Gone is another Sony Masterpiece and needs to be played by everyone at least once.

This game isn't perfect, no video games are but this is a very long game with a very slow burn as it gets fired up and is much deeper than it appears on the surface. The story is very linear and has its really great moments. Loved the game and its story! Characters like Boozer, Rikki are very well written. Challenges are extremely fun, background score is amazing and killing hordes is really fun and challenging.

Cons:
The main problem with days gone is it doesn't impress you in the first few hours. Open world is meh and feels dead. Making you walk along with NPC is hella irritating, bike upgrades doesn't feel satisfactory, killing marauders kinda feel useless and has no purpose. Game has its own bugs namely zombies being stuck half way in the ground, your bike behaving like Witcher's horse when you fast travel.

With all said, this game is fantastic if you manage to cross the first 5hrs. This game was review bombed on PS on launch but as Mark said, “This Is Mark Copeland For Radio Free Oregon. Don’t Believe The Lies.”

Loved this game and would recommend it.

Days Gone. A game developed by Bend Studio and Published by PlayStation mobile.

Very seldom do i finish a game and sit here at my desk contemplating what to write. It's also very seldom that a game hits every single heart string, stirs anger and vengeance to surface and cools it immediately with justice, love and hope. But as i sit here now at the end of my first playthrough of Days Gone, I struggle to find the words to describe this experience properly.
This isn't just a game, its a story, a world completely and entirely crafted to make you feel the nostalgia, to feel the loss of what was. This is...Days Gone.

Story: 8/10
Days Gone takes place 2 years after an outbreak of a lethal plague spreads across the world, your character and leader protagonist, Deacon St John. Struggles to come to terms with the loss of the old world and loved ones, the shape of the new world and the coming events that will take place. With his best friend and brother in arms, Boozer by his side he begins to traverse the huge open spaces of Oregon and unfolds a story that will captivate you till the very end. The story is extremely well written and doesn't leave many plot holes, there is a tremendous amount of lore and information scattered around the game world as well which will help you understand how people struggled to survive and why the world is the way it is. Perhaps my only true concern here is that the story at times feels unnecessarily long, at one point i thought the game was coming to a close, but instead opened up into an entirely new chapter. This isn't a bad thing though as the rest of the story following that point tied a lot of knots and filled in the blanks, but it sort of comes to a climax and then decides "Oh no you still need this part now!" which can leave you a little disappointed leading into it.

Gameplay: 8/10
+ Movement: Movement in these types of Zombie games is crucial to their experience. Being able to traverse the world and the battlefield is beyond important. So to see it done so well here is truly astounding. From riding your bike on the open road, to wandering the forests and towns on foot you will very rarely feel limited in what you can do and see.
+ Combat: Combat in this game was what i was expecting to have the most difficulty with, as the game requires you to be able to do so many types of actions in quick succession to succeed. But it suprisingly works really well here, the radial wheels you have access to, to select your items and weapons are beautifully intuitive and help you deal with even the worst unexpected problems. The guns all feel and look like they will do some damage, the battlefield traversal is fluid and the overall mechanic of combat has been designed to be challenging and rewarding in equal parts.
+ Enemy Variety: One thing these games tend to always get wrong is they have just an absolute LOAD of 1 type of enemy and everything else is bare bones. That's not the case in Days Gone. Much of the early game you will basically only have the basic Swarmer type enemy available to you, sort of as a learning curve, but as you discover more and more variants of the virus evolution, they will begin to appear around the world far more regularly which really forces you to plan attacks carefully.
+ Hordes: I think the reason most people play this game is to experience the Hordes, this is a fairly unique idea to zombie games, while many have tried it, i think this is one of the few games that succeeding in it. Hordes are personally terrifying masses of infected people that will chase you for as long as they can see you, they can vary in size and deadliness from a few dozen to several hundred and aren't to be taken on with half baked ideas. They are a significant threat and will punish you for even the smallest mistake.
+ Difficulty: I was torn whether this was a good or bad thing, but i decided in the end that more choices is always good. Days Gone has several difficulties to choose from, some seemingly unnecessary but having the option is always welcome. Ranging from Easy to Hard, then Hard II and Survival and Survival II all of which relatively drastically up the difficulty of the game as a whole.
- Chatter: While my next 2 points are marked as negative, they aren't all that bad as they are very easily circumvented through settings and gameplay, Days Gone has you doing a lot of tasks for a lot of people, and often the amount of inane chatter is quite frustrating. You will get a call from 1 person asking you to do a job, then the same person will call you up immediately, telling you about another job, and then again the same person will call you again to tell you thank you for completing their last job. While i appreciate the amount of dialogue the seemingly endless stream of it can be frustrating and easily missed if you entered a new task mid way through it.
- Autosaves: This is just plain frustrating. The game autosaves when it wants to, not at set intervals not at checkpoints it will just autosave whenever it thinks it needs to, even after loading an old autosave it will then autosave again, so all of your autosaves will be of the exact same spot in the game. This can be avoided by hardsaving whenever you feel the need to, and if you're playing on hard (or worse) you should save often.

Visuals: 9/10
I really REALLY wanted to give this section a 10/10. But found it almost impossible to do in the end. There is no mistaking that Days Gone is astoundingly beautiful, in nearly every aspect. From the world design to the very minor details of muddy footprints or weapon damage on enemies. The overall experience is astounding. However there was an express amount of graphical errors here, from enemies falling into the world not allowing me to loot them to just some enemies not rendering most of their bodies, or tables that are there but are invisible. The game runs smooth on my PC build (Specs in my profile) at ultra settings, Sitting steady at the chosen capped frame rate of 60. While at times especially when a lot of enemies are on the screen, the resource hunger becomes quite large. so perhaps setting your game lower graphically as a whole would be a better option than crashing every time you encounter a horde. World design in Days Gone is astounding, from the different biomes to how they are illustrated on the map is truly an experience to behold.

Audio: 9/10
Initially i rated the audio, 10/10, upon playing through the game for a second time however, i discovered a few pestering audio bugs, dialogue cutting out, cutting short or just being entirely talked over which broke immersion. While the overall quality is still very high, with its crisp and clean cutscenes, well orchestrated animation effects and the overall world design in terms of its audio. These small discrepancies over the space of a second playthrough really opened my eyes to what a lot of people were having issue with, which has caused the rating to drop by 1 point here. While this doesn't change the final conclusion i felt it was best placed here to denote the change of heart.

Final Thoughts: 9/10 "Excellent"
I have a soft spot for Zombie games, as they give me a sense of nostalgia and melancholy that many other games fail to do. Days Gone is definitely among the best i have ever played and i think i expressed that well in the paragraphs above. But it's far more than just a game, Its a journey and an experience. and a masterfully designed one to say the very least! Playing this game captivated me till the very end, through its highs and its lows and i truly believe its an experience that everyone should have at least once. I feel like a better gamer having witnessed it and if this is the calibre of games that PlayStation are looking to bring to PC then i am more than happy for them to keep on coming through!

Summary: bought this game with 50% off, well worth it.
Pro:
1.story not bad. Characters are well designed.
2.gunz blazing! Not bad!
3.roaming killing saving/taking life? Not bad!
4.Keyboard and mouse feels good in comparison to many ported game.

Con:
1.the gun customization and enemy variation are lacking.
2. repetitive missions are just repetitive, but this is a open world game, what do you expect.

8/10, buy it if you want to kill some time.

You get to ride a bike, kill zombies and blow stuff up! What's not to like?
Seriously though, this is a really good open world game with plenty of freedom and things to do to fill the time. Survival elements are also spot on. Have to admit, I loved all 70+ hours of it.

Now Sony, please give us Days Gone 2 (and on PC at some point)

When it comes to gameplay, Days Gone is nothing out of the ordinary. You've got your standard open world tropes with checkpoints that opens up more of the map, plenty of collectibles and other busywork.

The story, for the most part, is what kept me invested. I do enjoy a good adventure, and this is no exception. I'm also a big fan of Sam Witwers voice talent and although this is not his best work, he does a decent portrayal of the main protagonist.

What I do want to emphasize though, is that this is a fantastic PC port. It ran absolutely beautiful right out of the gate on my computer, but there's tons of stuff to tweak in the options if needed. Bend has done a superb job on the PC controls too, so good in fact, that I can't imagine playing the game with anything else than a mouse and keyboard. Great stuff.

This game has surprised the ♥♥♥♥ outta me. In terms of graphics and optimization in general. Ive never played a console exclusive that was later ported to pc and was so damn optimized. It seriously puts the regular AAA devs to shame. All the settings you demand and expect in a PC game are all there. It's even smooth as hell with kb/m which just shocked me.

It's an open world zombie game with a decent story, set in Oregon. People ♥♥♥♥♥ that it "doesn't do anything special", but I mean, does it really need to? Every open world game that comes out doesn't need to revolutionize the genre, and they absolutely don't, yet they don't catch nearly as much ♥♥♥♥ as DG has. I don't get it. This isn't a 10/10 game, absolutely not. But it's a damn solid game and deserves your attention if you're a fan of the genre.

Pretty good game, in fact the first zombie game i like since TLOU. The graphics are amazing, it runs like butter and the soundtrack is on point. Story and gameplay wise, I found it to be pretty solid, some moments were a bit repetitive and others were unbelievably good. I think for me Deacon carried it. Overall a good game to play.

I'll admit I disregarded this game when it originally came out, because I just believed what everyone else was saying. After buying it on PC I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's actually a pretty good game.
Fun combat, {mostly} well written characters and situations, and it subverted my expectations a good few times.
Some of the cutscenes and cinematics are edited strangely, and there's certainly some kinks in the overall package in terms of bugs but nothing that ruined my experience.
The gameplay itself is pretty satisfying, obviously reminiscent of Last of us, but that's not a bad thing to crib from. The horde fights are usually pretty intense, and there's a lot of dynamic parts with general enemy encounters and ways to approach.
Also, the facial capture is actually astounding, I've personally never seen such accurate mapping on someone's face in a game. Although I think they probably spent a bit too much of a budget on that and not buffing out the rough edges on the rest of the game.
The voice direction is overall very good, it tries pretty hard to sound natural {a lot of "uhms" and "uhs" and stammering, but they usually make it work pretty well}.

Overall, I would give it a good 80/100. I am glad I gave it a second chance, although they really struggle with first impressions.

TL;DR
If you ignored it when it came out originally, give it another chance. Fun game and charming story but rough around the edges.

Such an underrated game. Personally, this is the current best title this year for PC. I don't know why the game didn't get the praise it deserves on Playstation, but playing it from start to finish was a joy.

For me, the game changer was ONE MAJOR THING: Play it in SURVIVAL mode. I know that it may sounds like it's too much, but once you figure things out (and the game will give you that time), you will be much more immersed in the world.

So, no HUD and no on screen indicators. Just you and the road and problems along the way. This eliminates potential overwhelming feeling of the open world games. You will feel at ease as the time goes by, but it keeps things fresh for a much longer period of time. Even then, it's not a "tryhard" game, it feels like perfectly balanced mix of story and gameplay with a small added mix of "survival" feeling.

Story is OK, it keeps the game going, but it's not something that is groundbreaking in any regard. It's a personal journey of Deacon St John, and he is fully fleshed out character. He is not on the Arthur Morgan level, but he easily belongs in the category of great main protagonists.

Supporting cast is OK, some are acted and written a bit better, some a bit worse, but they all have their role to play.

As far as the combat goes, everything felt on point, from fighting random zombies on the way, human ambushes or even hordes. Every encounter has its own approach which can vary on a lot of things. Did you make too much noise? Did you pulled zombies to the human camp? Did you go in during the day or night? Are you going full stealth or guns blazing? Melee or ranged? The options are there, its on you to choose your path.

Also, I must add fantastic bike driving as it is really a big part of the game.

The game runs great. I played it when it came out in 1.0 version, and for me, there were no issues from day one. Also, it looks fantastic and sounds great. Colour palette personally is 100% on spot, because I really enjoy that overall dark green, brown, rainy, dirty feel. Of course, locations and colours will vary as you progress through the campaign.

If you feel an itch for a quality open world action adventure - think no more. Days Gone is one of the best things out there at the moment.

I have been starving for a good ubisoft game for years. Days Gone delivers the same outpost-tower-go-there-get-that experience but does it with style, nice narrative and engaging gameplay. It got me going far beyod what I was expecting and traversing the landscapes of this game is a pure joy,

Pros:
- Good amount of PC settings
- Cool graphics
- Cool characters
- I really waited for this port on PC

Cons:
- The data collecting policy.
I play single player games because i am not interested in any multiplayer, data collecting crap.
I can understand the reason behind but I don't like the fact that you cannot "opt out" for a product that you paid.
In my eyes this is not ok.

- Biggest con for me is that for me this game simply doesn't work.
- Each time I would be near the bike/quest related my frames would drop to 1.
- While free roaming there was no issue.

I've spend more then 1 hour just playing with settings, update all my drivers(nvidia latest Days Gone driver also), etc.
Even with 1024x768 resolution, everything on low i had the same result.

I would say my specs are pretty decent (rtx 2070 super, ryzen 2600, 16gb or ram, ssd 860 evo)
The game should run without any issues. I can run other demanding titles without any problem.

All and all, for me it was a bad experience, and I cannot recommend it.
I would say go for it only after a few patches, a price drop and at least an option to "opt out" of data sharing.

Later edit:
- I managed to get a refund
- Even after a complete reinstall game would still not work

Its okay at best, but for the price its totally not worth it.

Not to mention, the disgusting and frankly abhorrent Data collection. Absolutely unnecessary, claiming its to stop people cheating in the game. ITS A FU**ING SINGLE PLAYER GAME YOU IDIOTS! the only people who are going to be influenced by the cheats are the people trying to play the game, on their own, because there is no multiplayer for you to damage or create unbalance in. Its an actual Fu**king joke honestly.

This company should be ashamed of the way they are conducting themselves, and for such arbitrary and ridiculous reasons. You Sicken me. I probably can't get a refund after the 3.8 hours in game, half of which was spent trying to optimise the game as it keeps dropping frames when I'm in a camp, down to below 10 frequently. And you can't run offline, because of this companies insidious need to drain data from all devices connected to a network, on top of my PC, folders and files etc.

I've never been more sickened to have paid money to become a data bank.

Needlessly collecting data, so no. Whatever is behind that, won't play, can't play.

Days Gone is an open world third person shooter set in a post-apocalyptic version of Oregon. Player character Deacon St. John and his friend William “Boozer” Gray, who both used to be members of a biker gang, do jobs for camps of survivors while trying to stay alive in a world overrun by mutants.

Gameplay

• The world is full of dangerous enemies, including several types of mutants, Human bandits, and wildlife such as wolves and bears.

• The most common type of mutant, known as swarmers, are similar to Left 4 Dead style rage zombies and will chase after you, trying to bite or claw you. While weak in small numbers, you’ll sometimes encounter hordes containing hundreds of swarmers which can tear you apart in seconds if they surround you.

• Other types of mutants include breakers, whose massive size gives them powerful attacks and lots of health, newts are small mutated children who try to ambush you inside buildings, and screamers can disorient you while summoning other nearby mutants.

• To have any chance of surviving you’ll need a lot of firepower. You can buy a variety of ranged weapons from friendly camps, including different types of pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, light machine guns, sniper rifles and crossbows. While exploring you can pick up melee weapons such as a baseball bat or fire axe, and you can collect components to craft different types of grenades and molotovs.

• You’ll need precise aim as headshots are usually an instant kill, but most bodyshots just stagger enemies briefly. To aid this you can activate a focus mode to slow down time for a few seconds.

• Use stealth to gain an advantage by hiding in bushes, throw rocks to distract enemies, and sneak up behind them to perform melee takedowns. The noise of regular gunfire will often attract nearby mutants, but you can equip silencers on most guns.

• Mutants and bandits will sometimes attack each other. There were a couple of occasions where bandits shooting at me drew a horde to their location, and after the mutants killed all the bandits I just had to wait for them to wander away so I could loot their camp.

• You can ride around the map on Deacon’s bike, and although you’ll need to scavenge fuel to keep it running, its useful to keep the bike nearby just in case you aggro a horde and need to make a fast escape. You can unlock various upgrades for the bike at friendly camps, including storage for extra ammo for your guns.

Story

• Overall the story is excellent, despite a confusing start. I felt like it was missing a proper introduction to the state of the world and who the characters are, but over time it improves significantly, and there are a few flashbacks later on which fill in some gaps about what happened before the world fell apart.

• Cutscenes look very cinematic. Characters have high quality facial expressions, lip syncing and body language. Dialogue flows naturally like real life conversations.

• Voice acting is excellent throughout the whole cast, and especially Sam Witwer (Star Wars Force Unleashed) as Deacon.

• Fans of the Sons of Anarchy TV show will enjoy the references to MC lifestyle.

Technical

• There are two settings in the options menu for the camera to follow the player and the bike. I recommend disabling both, because when enabled the game appeared to be stuttering slightly, and I think the camera was fighting my mouse movements. After turning both off, the game felt much smoother.

• I didn’t notice any other bugs, crashes or framerate issues.

• Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.

• Environment is much nicer to look at than most post apocalypse worlds. There are some ruined buildings, but also lots of trees, colourful plants, and some areas are covered in snow.

• It took me 53 hours to complete the main story and all side quests, which involve helping friendly survivor groups by burning mutant nests, clearing bandit camps, and hunting criminals.

Recommendation

Days Gone is an excellent game which most players should enjoy, whether you’re looking for exciting action or a good story. There’s enough content to give you value for money at full price or a small sale.


This situation did not go exactly how I planned it.

My review page.
Follow me on twitch![www.twitch.tv]

The gist of it:
At first glance, Days Gone is a generic open-world zombie game, but the more you delve into it, the better it becomes. I loved it so much on PS4 that I had to play it again with better graphics and a higher framerate.

👍 The good parts:
+Horde killing is incredibly fun and satisfying.
+Characters slowly grow on you.
+Brian.

👎The bad parts:
-Horrible pacing, slow start to mid-game.
-Deacon's voice is very agitated.

Story
In Days Gone, you play as Deacon St. John, a very rough-around-the-edges character with no care about anyone but his friend Boozer. The game swiftly shows you a bit of a story background, how you and your friend ended up where you start playing the game, and it just thrusts you onto the world of Days Gone, riding your bike chasing some dude that stole from you.

The story won't blow your mind by any means, and it's not something you have not seen in other video games or movies, but it has a charm that I can't quite explain. It has a very rough start, and you will most likely hate how annoying and agitating Deacon acts but trust me, he gets so much better halfway in. The other supporting cast is great as well, Boozer, your friend, plays perfectly, but one character in particular that impressed me was Brian. He does not have that many scenes but the actor played him quite well. Make sure you watch the true ending.

Overall you will meet a ton of side characters, deal with some unsavory gangs, kill zombies, and the end. I know that does not sound impressive because it's not, but somehow in its simplicity, it grows on you: the bike riding, the silly characters, everything has this unique charm that is far from perfect but very grounded. Maybe I sound a bit biased or maybe everything I just mentioned clicks with me on a more personal level. Either way, I enjoyed the simple story, especially that true ending. I need a sequel.

Story rating: 7.5/10

Gameplay
Days Gone is an open-world third-person shooter, where you ride your bike from destination to destination and you kill zombies, humans, and sometimes even wildlife. It has some survival mechanics: for example, you always have to find fuel for your bike, and everything you can throw has to be crafted with various parts scattered around the map and a few other mechanics. It's certainly not something you'll have trouble dealing with, which is why I highly recommend playing on Survival mode if you can stomach no fast travel.

So let's talk about the juicy aspect of Days Gone, the horde killing. As I mentioned in the story aspect, the game has a bit of a rough start, and this applies to its gameplay as well. You will encounter groups of zombies that may pose a bit of a challenge, but the true and fun part of the game is the horde. You will face these hordes early in the game, but dealing with them will require your character to have some powerful gear and skills. They will overwhelm you very easily, and it will require a ton of run-and-gun tactics to stand a chance. Throwables are your life savers, so make sure you have plenty of those before trying to challenge these massive waves of zombies. Once you do start dealing with them, the game becomes super fun.

Killing zombies is not everything Deek will do: as you can expect, the world is filled with degenerate gangs and dangerous wildlife. You'll have to kill a lot of humans and animals, though, sadly, none of them will ever pose a challenge. Ride your bike, kill everything in your way, and have fun.

Gameplay rating: 8/10

Audio
The first thing you'll notice is Deek talking and acting very aggressively for almost no reason at times, but as the story progresses so does his acting. He becomes more mature and more understanding, and I think many people did not notice this and simply disregarded him as just a bad voice actor. They were wrong. As for the rest of the cast, they all do a great job at voicing their characters.

The soundtrack is very chill when roaming your bike, but once you start dealing with hordes, that's when it gets entertaining. It's a shame there are not a lot of tunes or a radio to listen to while you drive around the map. It would've made the lack of fast traveling on Survival less annoying. As for the sound effects, everything is perfect, from guns to zombie sounds.

Audio rating: 8/10

Graphics, performance and tech analysis
I was honestly shocked when I found out Days Gone was made on Unreal Engine 4. I hated this engine compared to its predecessor, mostly because a lot of devs did not know to utilize it properly, and most games looked samey and blurry. Days Gone on the other hand looks incredible, and it was made by a very small number of people. When the rain or snow hits the ground the atmosphere goes to eleven, especially if you're fighting tons of zombies. Locations could've used more variation than just outdoors but not a very big issue.

The game runs quite nicely, and besides some crashes and a few bugs here and there, I had a very smooth run from start to finish.

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 8.5/10

Conclusion
Do not listen to paid critics that cried about the game being too "white" whatever that means, or because the game had nothing innovative to offer. These are the same people who would rate Call of Duty a 9 or 10 every year. Yes, Days Gone is simplistic in its overall design, and the slow pacing may put you off, but have some patience with it, and you will hit a goldmine of fun zombie killing and some charming and memorable characters.

Final score: 8/10

I cannot recommend this game due to its "Game data collection" that you must consent to no matter what. There is no way to opt out completely. You will always be spied on, for a SINGLE PLAYER Game.

"Limited Data:
Content data-Video, Audio, Graphic, Text, Game Level, Account Information, ad and other content that is requested and downloaded for the textures, games, apps and websites you access online.
Network data-Info about your devices network connections (such as mobile, Ethernet, WI-FI and Bluetooth) including ip address and the number, requirements and speed of connections
Config Data-Information about your device's config, such as manufacturer, model, number of processors, display size and resolution, date, region, language, locale and capabilities.
Connected Hardware Data- Info about hardware connected to your device, such as game controllers and other peripherals.
Error Data-If an error occurs, the error code and basic data about when and where it occurred (an error could indicate a problem that needs fixing).
Load time Data-Basic information about how long it takes to download and upload data to your device(a long time may indicate a problem).
Security Data-Info necessary to detect and investigate malicious, unauthorized or fraudulent activity.
Legal Data- Info required by applicable law and to demonstrate compliance.
>That was just the limited data<

Full Data:
We may also send, receive and log additional, more detailed info about the config of your device. Full data may include more detailed info about how you interact with our game.
For example if you play one of our games, in addition to necessary online limited data(such as downloading a level or use of our game servers), we may access Full Data about your interaction with the game. This may include when and how you use the games user interface, which parts of the game level you visit, which weapons you use and which characters you interact with.
Game data is usually sent to us and stored with one or more unique network, device and/or account identifiers.

What do we use Game Data for?
Limited data and, if you allow it, full data collection is used and explained in our privacy policy. (www. playstation .com / legal / privacy-policy)

This includes use of game data to:
*Provide our online services
**Provide anonymous statistics.
***Understand the performance of your game or device, and to develop improvements and new products and services.
****Detect, investigate and minimize malicious, unauthorized or fraudulent behavior.
*****Audit, and for compliance and legal purposes ( for example, making or defending claims or activities that are required to comply with law)""

So with this im sorry to say a beloved game on ps4 is now a no for me. You can only choose between limited or full. Both of which are way to invasive. Most modern games allow you to opt out completely via settings. This must be chosen after the title screen "press any button" and is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ due to this game having no MP element whatsoever. There should not be a single kb of data collected for this game. If there is it should be "none" "limited" or "Full". Not just limited or full. So bend studios can suck a soda can, along with PSM. They wonder why DG2 was a big no.

This should be on the store page before people buy/pre-order so they can decide whether or not they want their digital privacy invaded.

You can block it, a User (Folken) has made a guide for this.

"Like RDR2 where your horse is a bike and everything else is screaming and chasing you.Die die zombie brrrrrrrrrrrr"

I bought this game for 32$ and i have no regrets about it.It took me 43h to complete story( and some exploration too).To get secret ending you must clear all hordes.I think this is the best PC port game from sony.Optimization is best.Story and graphics 100% <3 .I hope they will send more like this in the future.

Bend Studio's answer to all those bloated open world games that are full of repetitive missions, too much loot and collectables. It starts off slow, but rewards those who stick around. The map is clean, missions form a cohesive whole in service of the story or a more believable game world. Build up trust with camps to access new weapons, supplies and bike upgrades. Trade zombie ears, meat and herbs for credit in each camp with different stock. Make Oregon safer by clearing zombie-infested areas, camps of murderous people and mowing down massive hordes of zombies. Deacon St. John (Sam Witwer) is as equally murderous as his formerly human and still human victims, but you'll warm up to him in no time as he mourns the loss of his wife and tries to find meaning in his bounty-hunting, drifter ways.

No game is perfect of course, so you'll meet merchants who sound annoying with repetitive greetings and goodbyes. The people you save on the road thank you profusely but those interactions, while being relatively short, still somehow overstay their welcome. Using the weapon wheel with mouse can have some unintended moments of switched weapons at the worst possible time, but the slow motion focus skill gives you time to correct any false moves. Quite a few missions included desperately slow walks while talking with characters and the game likes to remind you that it's a video game by giving you red warning signs with LEAVING MISSION ZONE!

Sam Witwer and supporting cast are all great. You can see some twists coming a mile away, but the great performances soften the predictability of the story. The post-apocalyptic Oregon is like a fine mix of Sons of Anarchy meets I Am Legend or World War Z. It's a beautiful part of the US and not that many AAA games are set in places like these, so it has its own charm for sure. I'm very glad that Sony is moving closer to a PC audience, especially when it gives a second chance to underrated and overlooked PlayStation exclusives. I hope it does well, cos I wouldn't mind playing a sequel. While there's very little in terms of filler here, completionists will have to set some time aside for this one. Finished it in 88 hours on Normal and couldn't step away, so now I'm enjoying New Game+ on Hard II difficulty.

You have no control over your data transmitted while you "use" these files. POA & connection information is visible wherever you go; nothing new.

Days Gone requires you to submit to their data collection in limited capacity or full.

That is NOT ok.

Most of these rebuttal comments are inherently flawed (going nowhere, no real argument). Consoles have the exact same components (each have their own MAC address which then is issue a network address to talk to other computers). The data being collected are hours played, time spent in menus, personal information, spending habits, category, genre, and so much more but you don't realize it because you just plug it in and play the game.

The problem is with the hybrid class (millenial) we are not quite boomers but definitely not zoomers so we're in a position where we can fly a 1776 flag and defend our freedom (I.E. here) or resort to just vegging out for a weekend playing games.

Now, we forward to here. You are being profiled and you don't even know it. I don't have to give you my resume or prove myself to anyone for anything.

Most people who are fighting or arguing literally have no idea what they're talking about. They justify it by "oh you're already doing this and that". 99% of their retort is complete misdirection. Just browse some of the reviews and you'll see flat out racism, rudeness, and literal toxicity for no reason. Because someone told you the truth.

The POINT is what and why. Do you honestly think, in your brain, that they are collecting tremendous amounts of data just to improve 1 game? Wrong.

Any IT professional knows exactly what they're doing with your data.

The average internet user and/or video gamer has 0 clue. That's the point. Just put your CC in and play what I told you to play. And shut up, too!

It's not hyperbole.

Turn your brains on, get off the drugs, and spend your money wisely with studios who protect your data. Data transmission is ok; it's normal. Forced collection & unclear what, how, when, or why is not. Read the privacy policy (if you get through legal terminology and redundancy) and you'll see exactly what they CAN and MAY collect.

It's more than that.

The issue is not collection. The issue is clear choice of outcome and specifics involved with WHAT is being collected.

Hope this helps (if you actually read this).

I do not agree with the game data collection agreement. Why the hell does a single player game, which can be played offline, need to collect so much data? When I saw the data collection agreement and there was no option to opt out, I ALT+F4ed out of there, uninstalled it and requested a refund.

I really wanted to support Bend studio on this one because I want to see Days Gone 2. After seeing this data collection agreement I just can't. Introduce an opt out and I will buy the game again.

In order for the Steam Nomination badge I have to update a game I gave an award to, and Days Gone just happened to receive my vote as I still believe in everything I said earlier back when I fully completed the game. Game of the Year for me, in a heartbeat.



--Easily my second favorite game, behind Halo and in front of CS.

I spent 44 hours in the past 5 days to fully finish this game, all the way til the end while completing all story lines ( minus the last few percentages for just wandering around the map til you find them ) and I can happily call it one of my most favorite games of all time.

The story, the graphics, mechanics and all around feel of the game is absolutely beautiful and shows that Playstation Studios coming to PC is and can still be a massive success. I ran everything on Ultra without even tweaking any settings and had no issues dropping frames, besides in horde situations but only a tad. I cried, a couple times. To be honest, thats how good of a story this game is if you do really hunker down and play it through like I did. I felt attached and levelled with the characters. The characters in the story are all their own personality, and the voice actors did a wonderful job of capturing the scene and really giving character to these animations.

With two different regions to choose from, each with their own set of people and stories the game will give you PLENTY to do. None of this $60 game only giving 6-8 hours of gameplay BS. This is through and through, a tough and challenging game that will keep you entertained for ATLEAST 30 hours. That's how long the main story line is, and even if you just plow through that, you will most likely want to go back and clear out hordes, gather NERO injectors and just collect stuff. Its weird how this game made me keep going around for collectables. Even with the historical markers you could always get a chuckle if you run into one during a fight, and Deacon just reads about the history of the place while zombies and the likes are around him. Who knew, very interesting right?

It also isn't just zombies of course. Get ready to get ambushed on the road, or flung off your bike from a rope across the road. Bad crooks are everywhere and its your job to find their camp, and exterminate them. I'm talking walking in alone, killing 20+ people in sweet revenge as deacon yells at them and enjoys his time killin the crazy RIP'rs or Anarchists. Cults are a big thing from the story and there is a nice twist on everything as your going through their storyline.

Sarah. My goodness was the love interest in the story just a wonderful character. With the flashbacks, visiting her grave and everything else, you could really see how these two fell in love and wonder with each others backgrounds. Not only that but you are connected with everything, in many ways that the story reveals itself that caught me off guard. Many times I was surprised with where things went and I enjoyed every bit of it. The story itself is something that I could def see becoming a sequel but from another characters POV. Maybe a O'Brian special aye?

All in all. Get this game. I highly suggest anyone to play it and to finish it in full. It was well worth my time and I may even go back for a New Game +

There are already plenty of good reviews so I wont waste time. That said, things to know:

- It is a console port. Movement is very much 'on rails.' It's an open world game but the way your character moves makes even moving with a KBM feel like the running and direction change is being achieved by a control, forcibly.

- The story is ok. Not bad, just decently interesting enough. There were plenty of moments where you will know pretty much exactly what is about to happen.

- Zombies in the game are fairly terrifying in huge numbers, be VERY prepared to deal with the large groups to progress the game. (Plenty of bullets, explosives, traps, meds, etc...) Don't go in half-assed like I did for my first horde, it did not end well .

All in all it is a solid 7/10. If you like zombies, and open world stuff give it a shot. It should grab your attention.

OH and all the worry about the 'data collection.' If you are connected to the internet, through anything, they already got all your data...so...yea.

10/10 Sony please keep the PS games coming, I would love to have Uncharted the Series on here, I would Pre-order it in a heart beat, just listen to the reviews of this game and all of your games on steam. Can't wait until the next game to release from hopefully It's Uncharted or Little Big Planet.


PLEASE get it, It will blow you away on how BEAUTIFUL it is. Highly recommended

Very good port. I was amazed how well they prepare for multi monitor systems. Runs like butter.

However, extremely intrusive data collection options. There's no way to opt out in a single player game.

Thanks, that is refund.

What a gem this is ...storytelling/narrative/immersion/music ( esp. when your near a horde ) it gets you on the edge of your seat when playing at night..
One word of advice dont read anything about the story on the internet ...let the game surprise you... for me a solid 9/10
i do not give it a 10 because i had to reload 2 times a save where the game bugged out when trying to enter a ambush camp bunker . Still defenitly one of the best games i ever played..

After dying light this is the best game with zombies that i have played. The controls at the motorcycle feels good and realistic. The hordes of zombies are fun to kill and its good that you have a game plus. Try it you won t regret it.

I have always thought this game was the black sheep of PS4 exclusives due to mixed reviews. And by black sheep, I mean a regular 7/10. Having played it, I am exaggeratedly happy to report that the reports were exaggerated. There is a well-functional game loop here that kept me hooked for close to 50 hours without boredom setting in. The story was strong, the characters relatable and diverse. One of the most memorables games for me in recent times. Keep those exclusives coming please Sony.

you don't know if you should buy this game ? , critics reviews making you hesitate ? , you think its a shallow generic zombie game? , maybe you should listen to the players reviews instead , its more underrated than you can think , having one of the best characters , story , environments and sound design , making it one of the best post-apocalyptic games out there.

the truth shall set you free , this is Villain from Radio Free Oregon , don't believe the lies.

Excellent game with engaging story that inspires taking on more missions to unfold the narrative drama, especially the tragic romance.

Be careful not to run out of fuel as you can end up stranded with a hoard chasing you down xd.

Days Gone is the typical game where you sit down for a while.
A hefty single player campaign with a delightful story evolution,
one where you start eating before noon and before you realize it is suddenly much too late for dinner and then you have fast food delivered to your home.

Gameplay:

YouTube™ Video: The Zombie Apocalypse Has Begon! 
Views: 652
Days Gone on steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1259420/Days_Gone/ Days Gone on PS: https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA08966_00-DAYSGONECOMPLETE Days Gone webpage:...


The story starts as follows, an evacuation helicopter only has a limited number of places available and only 2 of the 3 can go with the helicopter.
It is then decided to evacuate only Sarah and to live together with his buddy Boozer as a secluded existence in the North American forests and I suspect also to get back to Sarah.

While it's not always easy, the duo dodge the Freakers most of the time, doing odd jobs on their bikes for nearby survivor camps, providing plenty of useful items.
One day, however, Boozer is seriously injured in an attack by the deranged Drifter clan. Suddenly Deacon is on his own. Luckily it's a tough rascal!
Fair is fair: Days Gone is not a zombie hack and slasher, but rather a survival story of an individual in an apocalyptic zombie outbreak.
That doesn't mean that the story isn't well put together!
However, the best thing about Days Gone is its raw, living world. The map isn't even that big, but because there's a quest marker everywhere, it never feels boring or empty. Even the filler content is perfectly integrated.
There are Freaker nests that you must smoke out for fasttravelling, settlements of the evil Nero co-op that contain a health or stamina upgrade, and more collectibles than a hoarder's house.
It's usually best to avoid confrontation because bullets are scarce and your melee weapons will break after just a few hits. In this way you constantly consider whether it is worth the effort to attack. Fortunately, there is a well-functioning stealth system in the game.

Days Gone also has great support for ultra-wide resolutions, you can see an example of that here:

YouTube™ Video: Days Gone at 3840*1080 32:9 4K on a SAMSUNG 49" CURVED LC49HG90DMUXEN 
Views: 107
Here is a short video that shows you Days Gone at an ultrawide resolution, the video is so short because the game crashed by some reason, i then played again on normal resolution and all was fine.

This is easily one of the best games I have ever played. Killing zombies, hordes, enemies is so much fun. You get bunch of different weapons, traps, bombs - it's all up to you how you wanna do it. It's a lot of fun and I highly recommend it to anyone to try it.
The story starts a little slow but it's great. The main characters are played by great actors and they make you relate to them a lot. Story itself is very emotional and keep you invested in it all the time.
End game with killing horde's is also a lot of fun.
Game is worth 40$ and I would easily pay 60 for it. Insanely beautiful game and I can see myself coming back to it in the future.

I don't get the hype or positive reviews honestly. I say Meh to OK, play if your bored... Game works great for me no issues, looks really good to. Zombies have spawned literally in front of me...But honestly its rinse and repeat missions. I saw a review comparing it to RDR2 and they must have not played RDR2 because this is nothing like RDR2. Redundant long cut scenes that break immersion. At first I liked the crafting but then realized this game is a copy and paste of Far Cry 5 just in 3rd person collecting item to just craft a couple of things (so far for me 2 things of importance). It even has very similar visuals and almost identical locations, (Houses, geography, map). This game reminds me of Fry Cry 5 so much with but with less guns, crafting, bases, less bloated etc.. I wish i did not play it more than two hours so I could refund it. Not worth $50 wait for a sale like $25. Do not be sucked into the hype-train.

Arround half an hour in:
Point 1: Data collection
They f*cking scan everything, everything you do and upload it and sell it. Prevent this by not buying this game or by denying it acces to the internet via your firewall.
Point 2: Buggy piece of sh*t
When I was playing with mouse and keyboard no matter the sensitivity every movement was jerky and unprecise. Exectly what you expect of a full price AAA game. And when i played with XBox-Controller I couldn't heal, so I didn't get beyond the tutorial. When I crafted the bandage, I couldn't use it.
I will try to play it with mouse and keyboard again screwing around in the options but right now I'm fairly inclined to just refund it.

Good zombies survival/action game. 🙂

Nice graphics, a well crafted universe and a decently sized open world.
Gameplay wise it doesn't reinvent the wheel but it's pretty solid, animations are top notch and combat is satisfying.
Story is alright, it's a sad and gritty game in a post apocalytic world, it does a great job at this.
If you like killing zombies and twisted renegades/bandits then you'll have a good time here.
Days Gone feels like a mix of Red Dead Redemption + State of Decay + Dead Rising so if you like any of these games you might enjoy Days Gone as well.
The game might get repetitive after a while tho and from what i've heard it's probably too long (around 30/40 hours of gameplay).

Just wished they added a two players coop mode that would have been pretty cool.
Also I think it's kinda stupid we can't drive any cars given the amount of abandoned cars there are on the map...
But maybe that's just me being nitpicky, there's only motorcycles to ride here, could have added more diversity.

From a technical standpoint this Days Gone pc version is a pretty good port, great keyboard and mouse support, lot of options and settings to tweak.
It runs like butter, really well optimized for pc, being an Unreal Engine game i guess it was lot easier to port.
Now we're waiting for more pc master race Playstation exclusives like God Of War, Marvel's Spider-Man and Ghost of Tsushima to name a few...

Rating 7.5/10.

Very good game, not as good as some other AAA games but still, I enjoyed it a lot. There are a few aspects of Days Gone, that really make the game shine mainly the motorcycle and the zombie hordes. The gun-play is also top notch as are the graphics, environmental design and some of the science fiction horror stuff is very nice.

On the down side though, the story is a bit too cringe for me and the characters are too. Although Deacon Saint John (main character) did grow on me and I did start to like some of them after a while. The game-play is kind of repetitive but again, this is mediated by solid and fun game-play mechanics. This game emulates Read Dead Redemption 2 a lot but it’s not as good as that game. Which in fairness is setting the bar about as high as it can go.

Days Gone is certainly up there, as a very good, open world, game but I feel like it could have been better. I got the sense that the developers would have taken the survival elements and world building even further but perhaps they were limited, by needing to appeal, to a mainstream player base. This game definitely deserves a sequel and it certainly suggests one at the end (secret ending). Especially with all of the garbage that gets made these days, there should, for sure be a Days Gone 2.

It runs great here on Steam and it really is well made, with a lot of attention to detail. Days Gone is a game that manages to overcome it’s more mediocre aspects by truly shining overall. It has it’s own identity and the game really does shine at times, especially when you are up against a massive horde of zombies. I really enjoyed it and I for sure recommend that you play it.

Mixed Review

Days Gone is a beautiful game with nice music, great atmosphere and a very unnecessary repetitive long story which is really predictable.
Although i really liked and enjoyed the game, its definitely not for everyone.

Basically in a very first hours of the game, you will experience everything that you will do for the next 30 hours+ in order to finish the game. Just in a different locations, with different NPCs and so on. It is extremely repetitive in every aspect of the game, but they somehow made it fun and enjoyable.
Its definitely not a game that i would want to play again, but i feel like i enjoyed as much as i could.
It was a very interesting title, just feel like it could be much better. Its a really good PC port though. I didnt experienced anything game breaking and i played it on launch.

Giving it thumbs up because i just love zombie games (especially in third person) and this was a very unique experience. There is no other game like this one

YouTube™ Video: Days Gone (ACTUAL Review) [PC] 
Views: 8,773
More PlayStation games on PC is always a good thing. Now this one I’ve heard mixed views on, but let's give it a fresh look with my Days Gone PC review!

Summarized review below!
More PlayStation games on PC is always a good thing. Now this one I’ve heard mixed views on, but given that I never got the chance to play the original, I went in with a fresh mindset.


Note: Trimmed review to fit character limit, check video for full version!


PC Port:
I have been unable to get my hands on an RTX 3080, so I’m still on a GTX 1070 Ti. Given that, I went into Days Gone fully expecting to not run it that well, but was surprised when I had the opposite experience. Running at 1440p and placing everything at medium settings, I was able to play through the game hovering around 70-80 fps and rarely dropping below 60. Whether I be indoors gunning down enemies, going off of ramps in the open-world with trees everywhere, or even tracking a horde of 100+ zombies, the framerate remained rock-solid through all of this.


Along with this solid performance comes a mountain of settings you can change – including FOV (which I set to 90), render scale, quality sliders, draw distance, motion blur, and even HDR settings if you have a display for it. The game supports uncapped framerates as well – which I was able to test by lowering my render scale until the fps cut off at the 155 allowed by my monitor.


Controls are completely rebindable on keyboard and mouse, but I felt no need to change them. The defaults are fine and I had no issues playing through the game entirely with mouse and keyboard. In fact, it might actually be a bit too easy this way because if you have at least somewhat decent aim, you can make pretty much every gun a one-shot kill if you land a headshot (granted, this was on normal difficulty).


Controller is still an option though and includes its own settings – such as aim snapping. I also got a chuckle out of seeing not just DualShock support, but Xbox One, Xbox 360, and Switch Pro controller settings – a bit of an odd sight for a Sony-published game, but a welcome one nonetheless.


Overall, I was impressed with the PC port. Not just for running well at 1440p on my aging graphics card, but for offering a relatively bug-free and polished experience. Solid controls, solid framerate, solid visuals – it’s much better than the subpar ports we usually get.


Gameplay:
Maybe it’s because I went into the game with low expectations given its mixed reception on PS4, but I actually enjoyed it. Not just the gameplay, but the story, the atmosphere, all of that. You get what is effectively an open-world Last of Us – and I know the comparisons are inevitable so I’m just going to get that out of the way from the start. You drive around on your motorcycle, completing missions and jobs for various camps, and dispatch of both zombies and enemy gangs in a very unforgiving world – one where you are constantly running out of ammo and fuel.


Combat:
There’s a decent variety of weapons to use and the general feel of aiming, swapping, and shooting is all solid. As mentioned previously, it is even better on PC because you can really put that CSGO aim to work with the mouse aiming and easy headshots. Melee combat is more of a mixed bag. It’s basically “spam left click and occasionally dodge” with attacks being magnetic towards enemies. It gets better once you add upgrades, but I ended up sticking with guns for the most part – the crossbow being my personal favorite because you can craft ammo for it on the go.


Enemy Variety:
For the most party, it’s the same type of zombie and human enemy thrown at you repeatedly. Only later do you get armored enemies, different zombie types, and the like – but still not quite enough to really give the game the variety it needs there. It’s only when hordes start becoming more common that it gets more exciting, as you literally have 100+ zombies on-screen and they will absolutely shred you if you are not prepared. Messing with these hordes and setting up traps and explosives to deal with them was easily one of my favorite things to do and I’m glad they became such a central part to the game later on.


Driving:
The actual feel to the motorcycle is great. Turning, accelerating, going off of ramps – it’s all pretty intuitive and I managed to get through the game without ever outright crashing (although I may have launched myself off a cliff a couple times accidentally). That said, there is a major drawback to the driving: fuel. You will literally expend an entire tank of gas going a mere 2 kilometers (a little over a mile in American units), so the constant need to refuel is a bit annoying and easily one of my least favorite things about the game.


Exploration & Map Design:
This area of the game is neither good, nor outright bad. The random events, burning of nests, and clearing of enemy camps is fun and all, but there isn’t enough of it. It’s not like Fallout or Elder Scrolls where there’s side quests and locations everywhere, it’s more of a “oh, an enemy camp to quickly clear before moving on” kinda thing. Even when you do find an abandoned town to explore, it’s mostly the same crafting materials you found in the last. I just wish the game world were more dense with actual content and didn’t encourage me to fast travel everywhere.


Story:
Sure, the story may be a bit too long for its own good, but I enjoyed it. Characters that actually have depth and make reasonable decisions, acting that doesn’t come across as forced, and an overall writing style that keeps you playing – it is anything but predictable and boring. I went into the game expecting some edgy biker dude gunning down zombies, but quickly grew to like the main character here – faults and all. He’s logical, resourceful, calm, yet ruthless when he needs to be – the perfect combination to carry a gritty story like this.


Overall:
Days Gone is both a solid PC port and a solid game. Fun gameplay and good storytelling all while running at a steady framerate with little in the way of bugs or technical issues. Sure, the base game may have some issues (particularly in the way of exploration and world design), but it’s a fun experience all things considered and I do not regret my time with it.

One of the best single-player, story driven games I have ever played. The story revolves around Deacon, a MC 1%er drifter and Boozer, his MC buddy (amongst many other characters) as they tackle an onslaught of zombie hordes, in search of Deacon's girl, Sarah, who goes missing during an early invasion. Impressive characters, massive open world and an excellent music score that compliments key points throughout the journey. Truly impressive how things come together at the end (four different endings or progression, depending on how much of the side game is completed), very enjoyable, memorable, and highly recommended!

The review you are about to read is based on my own experience with the game, my judgment, and the rating system! No third party has impacted anything said in this review. This review is also 100% spoiler-free, so you don't need to worry about that either.

Gameplay and Interaction (15 out of 20)
Gameplay-wise, Days Gone is just another survival open-world video game set in its vast and repetitive open-world. As far as the interaction goes, Days Gone's got you hooked up with a crafting system, a bike that you can ride to traverse the world, and some other mandatory elements that every open-world game has. As far as the general traversal goes, I'm happy to say that it doesn't take days to get anywhere. You can also fast travel, which consumes the gas from your bike. It wouldn't make much sense if you'd be able to just fast travel across the map without losing anything.

The bike your character rides (obviously) consumes the gas, and the gameplay revolves around filling the gas tank and repairing the bike itself. Thankfully, it's possible to refuel in camps, gas stations, and specific locations. So, it isn't as scarce as you might think at first. Also, there's this one thing that doesn't make much sense. There are tons and tons of police cars around the world that contain ammo in their trunks. It makes sense that all of the police force was deployed after the outbreak, but a remote forest in the middle of nowhere for sure wouldn't be getting this much attention. Other than that, I don't have many complaints resource looting-wise.

As for the rest of the stuff you can interact with, there are these infestation areas and nests you must burn, enemy camps you must clear, Nero upgrade stations to visit, hordes to take out, etc. There are also friendly camps where you can upgrade your bike and weapons, purchase ammo, and stuff like that. The random activities that regularly pop up are mostly repetitive side hustles that I ignored completely for the most part. The whole gameplay loop is very repetitive, and there isn't anything special about any of the activities you get to do.

The most enjoyable thing for me in Days Gone is shooting. Every single weapon in the game is satisfying to shoot. Hitting a headshot at a range with a rifle feels special, and shooting a few enemies in cowboy style using focus mode in close combat is as much fun if not even better than shooting a rifle. It's just pure sex if you ask me. Whoever did the shooting mechanics deserves to be recognized.

Graphics and Sound Quality (17 out of 20)
The graphics are nice, not ground-breaking, but nice. There are plenty of locations that you must stop by and appreciate. I like when a game offers a nice view or carefully designed locations that speak for themselves. As far as the sound quality is concerned, the soundtrack pieces are good and memorable, and the overall sound effect quality is also nicely done. The ambient sounds truly make you feel like you're there in person. The only thing that could've been better is the sound of zombies. At times, they sound like someone put a sock inside their mouths.

Performance and Optimization (18 out of 20)
If a game of this scale is using Unreal Engine 4, it just screams of technical issues. Although I did not experience any major issues, a few of my friends and a ton of other people have mentioned ridiculous amounts of stutters and freezing throughout the game. As for the rest of this so-called PC port, the game runs perfectly and scales nicely across various hardware. The only thing that I found problematic are slowdowns while riding a bike. Something makes the game slow down to 75% speed while maintaining perfectly stable framerate and frame pacing. There is no stutter, only the slow down. It's very noticeable.

Story and Content Value (13 out of 20)
I didn't think it'd be this hard to explain the issues I've had with the story and the pacing thereof. I'm not saying that the story is bad or anything like that, but it lacks proper pace. The opening scene hooked me with the game right away, and I was excited to see what lies ahead. Well, let's say that it didn't go the way I thought it would. The beginning itself is fast and exciting as all the stuff that's presenting you with what the game has to offer happens. After the 'get to know your game' part, it felt like nothing is happening. I was ready for the game to start throwing little bits and pieces of something bigger at me, but it never happened. The repetitive side quests I got to do didn't help either, and I won't even begin to mention the average job the game does of introducing certain characters. The main story missions are there, but you can't keep doing just that. Sadly, I found most of the story piece through the first half boring as there was nothing of value coming out of them.

Yes, you get greeted with a piece of information here and there. And then, you're just left there empty-handed until the next important mission comes around that again adds nothing of value. It might be just me not liking the slow and methodical approach. I'm also not asking to see the ending right away, but at least give me a reason to continue. Halfway through the game, something big happens, and I was back aboard the hype train. The story missions get a lot better - especially in the second half and the last third of the game. My humble opinion regarding all of this is that it might be a little bit too late for the real story to start unfolding at this point. In the end, if you ignore all the quirks, it's worth getting through to the finish. The lackluster pacing of the story doesn't get completely repaid, in my opinion.

Animations and Movement Controls (12 out of 20)
The animation work is another segment of Days Gone worth discussing, as it lacks quality in a few ways. The overall movement feels satisfying, and the bike you get to ride feels nice most of the time, but that's pretty much it. Character animations are mostly static, and none of the characters have their "own" and unique kind of movement. Also, it does take time to get used to the gameplay. The less important characters are copy-pasted to the point where even certain characters with names look the same as NPCs. There are games out there with specific animations set for certain characters, making you believe that they're real people. Days Gone did not get that much attention. The rest of the animation work is acceptable, except the horde moments - which kind of look like a swarm of ants running at you instead of zombies.

Final Score and Conclusion (75 out of 100)
Days Gone is yet another survival open-world video game worth playing that lacks proper story-telling. I'd say Days Gone is like that one girl you have a crush on, and no matter how much you state that you love her, give attention to her - she just won't give in. As if that's something you're willing to tolerate until (and if) the hook-up eventually happens, that's completely up to you. All in all, I'm glad that we got the Days Gone game on the PC - as it plays a whole lot better when compared to the console release.

There are no choices. Everyone is an a-hole, including me. If it was the end of the world and I was armed to the teeth and anyone treated me like that, they'd all be dead; Tucker and her little crew would have been first, siding with anyone that stole and ran from them. Missions are played out one way and one way only. Mission talkers that are just out for a Sunday stroll, worse than escort missions in WoW.
Yes, the game has nice graphics. You get to ride a bike ... yay. Apparently you're totally incapable of giving it a paint job with out help from some d-bag in a slave camp. I can't begin to imagine how there is any replaying this game after you finish. Nothing can be done differently. New game +? more likely just get a new game.

Glad I bought it on sale. 2/5 stars

I loved this game on PS4, but due to the Playstation 4's elderly hardware it was hard to enjoy at times with frame rates in the 10-15 range. It was as you say "A Diamond in the rough", with this port it runs like butter, so so smooth! Sony you see the overwhelming love this game has got, make a sequel! Sony releasing first party games to Steam is a win win for everyone. A Diamond in the rough polished to perfection!

This game can be quite slow to start up , but when it gets going its a lot of fun. Its high production values shine through as you get to the later areas. Its a well made game that for me had no bugs of any consequence. Definitely worth a purchase. 10/10

Honestly one of THE best ports I've seen done.

Gameplay loop is hit or miss with some people, sure. Game is a slow burn on content and story. It's nothing extremely revolutionary but personally I do find the game enjoyable.

I was kind of looking for this game on PC, but I went in with no expectations.
Actually the main reason why I bought it was to support Sony and their transfer of games to PC (God of War next? wink wink nudge nudge)
But the game is very fun to play, love riding the bike, killing hordes is intense AF and the world and graphics are beautiful. KKona.
The only thing I'm missing is some songs on the bike's radio, but that still might come, who knows :)

The game play was fun, there's lots to do and no bugs that I ran into. If that's what you like, this game delivers. What I like is story, so:

*********************STORY SPOILERS ***************************

The game did make me care about all of the main characters by the end but when the story started, I found myself really disagreeing and disliking every possible way the main character conducted himself. He's a real arrogant jerk, and doesn't shy away from being rude and SASSY towards people. Eventually, it seems endearing when you see him playfully through the eyes of his wife, but in the beginning, it's a struggle to connect with such a disagreeable fellow! You could say that's realistic for the apocalypse and loosing loved ones though so..

I also thought the love story between husband and wife started so wooden and bland, just two people who were attracted to each other despite having nothing in common. WHY would she go for such a loser, when she's a successful scientist? Because he's cute? Not good enough reason, imo! And, once they're finally reunited - I think the story does not do a very good job in explaining why they're so distant from one another. He longed for her, searched everyday, and then pretends to be cool and nonchalant after finding her? And she also pretends to be stoic and stern, because??? She couldn't do science with her husband around? Like what? Why? Would the colonel who was running the place have forbidden their marriage entirely? He said he was against coupling up, but as a religious dude, wouldn't he have given them a pass for having been married before the outbreak? I don't know, none of us do, because they just decide not to tell anyone there for unknown reasons.

So while the story failed in showing why they were distant, it made up for that in how nicely their reconnecting was done. I couldn't wait to take on mission after mission for the wife, so I could see how they would be interacting. They had some good, emotional writing and some exhilarating quests. You wanted to see how long it would take for either she or he to 'crack' and admit they were pining for, and still in love with, the other. (even though it didn't make sense why they hid this in the first place)

While he was still looking for the wife, I thought all the missions for NERO were fun and they were interesting, giving just enough lore about the zombies to differentiate them in this universe and keep you guessing how the plague started and how they related to it. I wasn't surprised with the reveal because they did a great job foreshadowing the wife's team's involvement, both in flashbacks and in the scattered audio logs.

I did feel my heart swell as the music crested as the credits rolled, because I had a good time with the cast. I'll miss every one of the good guys I met, just like you do when a good jrpg or favorite anime finishes. I won't say this game is a favorite of mine, I'm sure I won't play it again, but it was like a good book in that I don't regret playing it and if you're someone who likes a gripping story, I would encourage you to give this game a go!

Final Verdict: Solid Game, Buy!

Days Gone is a good, solid game that falls short of greatness. The best thing about this game is just riding around in your bike and enjoying the beautiful landscapes. The developers put a lot of attention to detail in many aspects of this experience, from the way your bike rides through shallow water, or leaves tracks in the snow or mud, or even the different ways that snow falls to the ground. It took me a little over 61 hours to complete the game (taking my time and doing as many activities as possible).

The horde is absolutely terrifying each time you come across one. The first time you see one you're almost powerless to do anything about it other than run away or hide. Soon though you get enough firepower to be able to take down a horde although even then it is quite the encounter.

Unfortunately, this game is very uneven in its story-telling. There's a whole story line about mutations increasing and it's just kind of dropped. Someone (avoiding spoiler) is working on this possible cure and you encourage them to keep trying after a failure. This goes nowhere after this sequence of events. There's a NERO faction that is prevalent throughout the game and then at the end is never heard from again. There were many possibilities for the story to have really gone somewhere impactful, but instead it goes for a fairy-tale like ending.

The second half of the game opens up new areas that, while more dangerous than the early starting areas, feel a lot more grindy. Mission types are repeated and the gameplay starts to feel stale. Things aren't helped by the fact that random encounters basically re-use assets. The same looking guy you just saved needs another saving from the same baddies in the same or similar area. This game starts to feel like an Ubisoft Far Cry game.

The voice actors did a good job. Some story lines, especially the ones where Deacon St. John is remembering the past, are written very well. The musical soundtrack is also good. The sound-work in general is done superbly. I only experienced a few minor bugs during my 60+ hour gameplay. Please note: if you have trouble launching the game, make sure to optimize the game using Nvidia's control panel. The game ran fine on my RTX 3080 where I would get good 90-144 fps on the highest graphical settiings (2560 x 1440 monitor).

Rate 7.5/10.

[New review]
Updating my original review. I have finished the game. It took me 46 hours. That's mind blowing.
Everything in my old review is still correct for the exception of the story. The story just gets better and better. At the end I wished it didn't finish, and that's after 46 hours of gameplay. I could not get enough of it.
I have only encountered 2 negatives in all these hours. I had one game breaking bug, but after restarting the game it worked. I lost about 15 minutes of gameplay so no big deal. The other is that the quest list is not very organized, making it hard to navigate through it to take a look at the main story quests towards the end, when you have a ton of side stuff.

Slight spoiler 

All in all, this is one of my favorite games all-time and I have played a lot of games. Just take a look at the achievements, 31.8% of players have finished the story - a 40+ hour story. That by itself says enough. Very much recommended.

[Old review]
I put 10 hours in 2 days in this game. My initial opinion was "oh well looks like people like it, I guess I'll try it."
After 10 hours I'm fully invested into the game. I'm nowhere near the end because I'm just exploring and doing things as I go - not very common for me.
The easiest way to think of it is "what a TWD game should have been". Think of it as a dumbed down RDR2 with a TWD story. Obviously RDR2 is in its own league, but this game will definitely take your attention for a good chunk of game time.

The optimization is impressive.
The story is not the best but good enough to keep you entertained.
The gameplay is very good. There are a few things that are an annoyance but overall it's a great experience.
The controls are not the most intuitive but easy to get used to (I play with controller).
I wish there was co-op but I can't complain at all. Thumbs up for me. So far 8.75/10

Really surprisingly good game, I honestly give it a 10/10 and if you've always barely given this game a chance, please try and give it another look.

I really think the fact that it was an exclusive PS4 release (at the end of the consoles gen where people were getting sick of 30FPS caps and crappy performance) and the buggy rough launch really caused this game to be dragged through the mud and people didnt give it a chance or second look because of these factors.

And if your looking for quality and quantity this is the game to get it, took me just under 60 hours to complete the story and a large chunk of the side content, there is still many more hours of horde killing quests I still have to do, and a bunch more bounty missions, this game is one of the longest story driven open world games I have ever played, comparable to the length of RDR2.

But man o man, it's gotta be one of the most enjoyable and unique zombie games I have ever played.

The bike adds so much uniqueness to the experience, I mean name one open world zombie game with an upgradable motorcycle as your main mode of transportation? and it really helps that the bike feels amazing to ride and control.

Not to mention the horde fights? Have to be some of the most fun I have ever had with a zombie game, PC mods really help this game shine, install a mod that increases the vanilla horde size alot more and you have yourself one of the most heart-pounding adrenaline rush experiences in the zombie game genre you've literally ever experienced.

Seriously don't overlook this game, Its story is decent too, not the last of us mind you, but its good enough to keep me interested. OH AND THE GAME RUNS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AMAZING ON PC HOLY CHRIST.

A smooth 90 FPS the entire game, absolutely gorgeous with a mod and a reshade.

10/10, with my only complaint being the sometimes "off" writing. If the writing was perfect this could be comparable to the last of us levels of quality.

First and foremost. I want to thank the people at PlayStation for opening up the PlayStation Studio catalogue for PC players. Even though I already bought and completed Days Gone on the PS4 I had support the game on PC. Hopefully games like God Of War, Bloodborne, and Spider-Man can make it's way to PC like Days Gone and Horizon Zero Dawn did.

With the little time I spent with the PC Port I'm extremely impressed how optimised it is. It's great port with all the bells and whistles us PC gamers have come to expect. This super underrated PlayStation exclusive deserves support. So check it out people.

Shoutout to Jim Ryan and I can't wait to see whats next. Whole Slate ;)

This game is underrated tbh, The story is long, but i enjoyed every bit of it, the connection, feel, graphics, landscape, scenery, are just amazing in this game. It took me around 67 hours to complete the story, but I enjoyed every bit of it. The story is even good than GOD OF WAR itself. This is worth $20, and is a must play, but remember, it's a long game, and one must have the patience, to actually enjoy this amazing journey,

Love you Deacon St. John, You'll be missed and hope you're going to have an amazing life.

Game is fun so far, I'm enjoying it.


There's the occasional frame dips in certain areas (some worse then others, as low as 50 fps at Copeland for example) such as encampments, but aside from that I'm getting a pretty consistent 110-120 fps on Ultra in 1080p in practically all other parts of the open world.

Will rewrite as I spend more time.

Long story short: They killed it with this port.

So far the game runs buttery smooth and had little to no trouble running it on my PC. To be honest, I thought this port was gonna run poorly like Horizon Zero Dawn's PC launch or the absolute dumpster fire state of this game when it first launched on PS4. And I'm glad to admit that I was wrong.

Now the game itself:
To be blunt, this game doesn't do much to to set itself apart from other open-world zombie games like Dying Light has(Speaking of Dying Light, when the hell are they gonna announce the release date of the sequel?). But that's not to say there wasn't at least an attempt made. The game looks great, using the bike feels good to control, and the games' main selling point: dealing with hordes. When dealing with hordes, having a stamina bar is both a blessing and a curse in this situation. When you run out of stamina, you're as good as dead and have to start all the way over. On the other hand, it forces you to plan your route and the placement of traps which makes each horde mission feel different.

The Story:
The story can be best described as somewhere between not good and not bad. It's okay. I think the problem lies with the cutscenes having some jarring transitions or just being straight up unnecessary. Hell, in the beginning it felt like there was gonna be playable section but was cut out with little to no changes made to the cutscenes and felt like some context was missing. Everything else I thought did it's job very well.

Conclusion:
I think this game was pretty underrated. It has its issues but nothing that would completely hinder your experience. I do hope Sony keeps up the trend of making more PC ports for their exclusives and I can't wait to see what else they have planned.

I liked this game the same way just like how Detroit Become Human left a mark in my life for its beautiful gameplay & perfect story.

It's almost like I can feel everything Deacon feels all the way through, his struggles, his frustration, his pain and his joy... It all feels real in a way that very few other game does.

It is a masterpiece indeed, No character is two dimensional and so I feel like I've grown a bond with everyone.

If it were possible to sum this game up in one word it would be Hopeful, in many ways this game radiates hope from its fantastic story and it's polished world and gameplay to hope for the future of gaming and how impactful they can become.

To the developers of Days Gone: You are all amazing and I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
A one of a kind journey and one that will be remembered for it and it is Days Gone

And please increase the stamina of the player coz after running 2 metre only its shows stamina depleted ;)
My Rating - 9/10

I'm only 14 hours into the game. I'm not good at reviews either so I'll keep it short.
It has noticeably better graphics than Red Dead Redemption 2. Quite a statement I know. But you'll see.
The zombies are very fun and have remained engaging and enjoyable for 14 hours so far.
On an RTX 3080 I'm getting a rock solid 80 FPS in 4K ULTRA or 100 FPS 4K at 90% resolution scale.
It runs very stable. No crazy frame drops like 95% of games made in recent years.
The story is actually better than most games that we get these days. I like it quite a bit.

With some of the best graphics you'll see in a video game, as well as a very stable
frame rate, fun game play loop, an open world map that isn't over-sized
or littered with check marks, the best motorcycle riding in any story driven game ever, very meaty combat
and above average story, I'd say that it lands somewhere around an 85/100 in my opinion.

This isn't one of those games to just pass the time. It's actually enjoyable and engaging.

Definitely worth $50.

Honestly, this is an amazing game i do not regret in the least playing through. Everything is just...right. Gunplay is amazing, fighting freakers and hordes as well. The story although kind of predictive, is still very nice, i even got chills at some points. Voice acting is on point. Easily one of my favorite games overall and would recommend it to anyone.

For the cons i'd say it boils down to a lengthy campaign, which is not everyone's cup of tea. Some bugs here and there, nothing gamebreaking. Biking around could annoy some people, or not, this one can go either way. Of course it can also become repetitive if you're one of those people who wants things to always feel "fresh".

Recommended? (AKA tl;dr)

Though the gameplay itself is very mediocre at best, I still highly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. *IF* you like Zombies, Survival, (melee & ranged) combat and some more-or-less-open-world all wrapped up in
a brutally predictable - yet absolutely enjoyable - story. If you hate one of those though, stay away. You'd be disappointed.

The mediocre gameplay like gathering stuff annoyed me VERY quickly, but you can cheat those parts if you're not in the for the full hardcore-survival-experience. If you love endless gathering and a never-ending-treadmill, you will be at home here. It felt tedious to search for trees to stock up on darts or the next melee-weapon while you had to use them to survive to find them et cetera. At least for me :-)

Despite the gameplay-downsides, the story totally made up for it.
Predictable? TOTALLY.
Cliché-ridden? YOU BET.
Stereotype-flooded? OH LORD YES.
But it's a nice post-apocalyptic, (b)romance-filled, zombie-killing, biker-y setting in a beautiful scenery. Open-World is in big quotes here, as you have NO choices at all and whenever you complete an open quests, there comes the next one automatically without searching. This is definitely a very narrow-pathed, story-driven survival with decent combat.

And last but not least, the port is very decent too (with the latest patch). Doesn't always feel overly "console-y" like most other ports.

Do I regret purchasing at release-price? Not a second. Would I do it again? Absolutely. Do I see where the bad reviews are coming from? Yup, totally! Really depends on what you find enjoyable.
How many biker-themed Zombie-survival-games are there to judge against? Yeah right.


The good (what to love):
Above average story, well told, even if very predictable.
Well done port on the technical side, sadly that's a thing to mention as "good" nowadays. Performs well, options adapted adequately to PC, it does not feel totally "controllery"
Good fighting, skill-tree-progression is noticeable
Decent stealth-technique
Good voice-acting (original language), except the one listed under "the ugly"
Interestingly sparse score. Usually it's pretty quiet beside ambient noises, and if there's music it feels "special". I liked that kind of unusual approach to the score
Difficulty from REALLY EASY to REALLY HARD. And even a New-game-plus.
Auto-saves while in-mission are really fair. If you fail, you won't have to repeat EVERYTHING, just a little bit. That pleases my inner casual :-)
Protagonist feels a lil like Jax from "Sons of Anarchy". IF that feels "good" to you ,-)
Lovely setting and driving the bike was done very well too (except see "ugly")
You sometimes get unexpectedly ambushed while doing a chilly stroll on the road. Loved it


The mediocre (neither good nor bad, or simply not objectively either. YOU judge):
Often un-skippable, but at least pause-able, cutscenes. Of which there are a lot. Not that I mind a good story, but what about a replay? Or a reload because you screwed up?
Some harder achievements, if you do care about those. Like finding EVERY collectible. Because exploring isn't very rewarding at all.


The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):
Unless you totally love the world and everything, there isn't really any motivation to explore (after the first 5-10 houses) except to refill your crafting-materials. And besides the handful collectibles (which serve no purpose other than collecting them (and occasionally unlocking some decal for your bike)) there is basically nothing to discover.
Simple "bugs" which were probably just introduced to annoy pirates, like incredible sucky camera-movement. But that's been "fixed" now. Now it works as expected and feels WAY better.
Gathering resources is fun for around the first minutes, then it becomes annoying and tedious. Watching that plant-gathering-animation for the 5000th time is nothing than stretching time forcefully. If you love that, you're in for a ride. If you don't, you could very well cheat your way through. But you could not skip it "legally"
The main-character's voice-acting. While being enjoyable and well-cast overall, the scripting often made me ponder if he's got just some serious speech-problems. The amount of "errr"s and "hmm"s and nervous coughs in his sentences, even for the minuscule of spoken words, was legion. It very very often killed the immersion/enjoyment of the story completely. It felt horribly forced and was absolutely overdone
The survival-instinct could HIGHLY benefit from a distinction between "something you need" and "there is something you COULD use (but sadly your inventory-capacity for this things is reached, but we will only tell you if you're already in 1-meter-vicinity)". It annoys highly to sneak up around some houses to gather stuff, just to discover a ton of stuff you CAN'T pickup because you're already full. Which you will just see then you are already in front of it. UGH! Stop wasting my immersion...
Have to follow someone? Yeah, we have this idea: How about you always walk/run a tiny bit faster than him/her, so you always have to walk around him/her in circles like an ADHD-hummingbird but off of Ritalin and instead on cocaine? Yeah. This. After millions of games having THIS stupid "feature". It still didn't die
Survive a horde of Zeds? Yeah no biggie. Stumble with your bike over a rock and drive with 30km/h into a tree? WASTED! Sometimes it's unintentionally funny and a nasty immersion-killer
Some un-skippable cut-scenes. Especially annoying are those where you free people from other people. And they all stutter the exact same crap
Hordes don't require much planning or finesse. Once you figured you just need <SPOILER!> and then some <SPOILER!>, you're fine. It's more grind than puzzle or planning.

Bikers life in postapocalyptic zombie land was never easy. You as one of them trying to survive. This sets a tone to whole game view. The world is dire and became big bad minefield. Its up to you to strap on, put that amazing bikers jacket and burn the tires on your metal horse.
Fantastic view of a landscape. Everywhere you go you see impact of destruction by the freakers. The world is so immerse and feels so real. Everyone is trying to survive the day on its own way. Explore, find fuel and basic needs for survival before you get to safe camps. Being alone here is not an option. So its up to you to find your path and unite the people.
Story is quite interesting and you meet a lot of amazing characters. Boozer one of them. Its shows what true friends is. One of the real interactions shown here for sure. Story doesn’t end here cause you have to deal with a lot of psychos to. Clearing some bandints or rippers from the land feels dangerous. Especially if you play on highest difficulty. Freaker hordes can wipe your face from extinction like nothing. This threat is very scary and you have to use whole variety of weapons and gadgets. Comba feels very grounded and good. Shooting feels impactful with eatch shot.
Best part for me in this game was riding and upgrading your motorbike. Not only it is your wheels but sometimes it is your home or all you have here and now. Upgrading each part and seeing how evolves your bike from metal junk into metal god. It is reall that simple and satisfying to feel with each upgrade how better and better you controlling this beast.
If you liked game like Mad Max, this is for you. It reminded me how well done both games are.

Let me start out with I recommend the game. (if only we had a custom review and not like or dislike) The game is great but they didn't say anything about "game data collection" We don't need another Facebook on our hands. Once you play the game they have access to your whole network and know your deepest, darkest secrets :)

Expected more from a AAA game. Game is generic, boring, and uninspired. I am given no reason to care about any of the characters. If you're looking for a mediocre AAA game, this is it.
On a technical level I did not experience any issues. Game runs smooth with no serious bugs.

Days Gone took it's time to grow on me but it was too good to keep me on the fence. I found the story began a little slow and I just wasn't sure I would enjoy it all the way til the end but it really came around on me, it's a solid game with one hell of main character. I will admit I am a huge fan of Sam Witwer and his work in the star wars universe and this certainly felt like a leap for him but the personal touches he gave to Deacon made him a favorite mc of mine. The open-world is fairly sized but the landscapes are graphically outstanding and I really enjoyed exploring it all.

As for gameplay, while I enjoyed the overall gunplay and driving mechanics it did feel as if the difficulty was a little lacking if you weren't playing on survival mode. I began a playthrough on Hard 2 and while I died a few times in the beginning trying to get the hang of it, there was a point early on where after leveling just a bit and finding nero injectors to boost stats, it felt like there wasn't much challenge. So I did start an early new game+ on survival and felt that did it justice, keep in mind if you wish to fast travel and not spend most of your time driving across the map then keeping to hard mode or lower is the right choice.

Overall it exceeded my expectations and delivered a gripping story that severely needs a sequel.

This is a hard one to review. I think the game is quite serviceable, reasonably entertaining, seems well-optimized and clearly has a bit of cult-following. But I tried getting into the game twice (once on PS4, secondly here on PC) and each time I just lost interest or became frustrated with the mechanics.

I think a lot of my disappointment has to do with the story, acting, and pacing. Right from the very, very beginning the main character makes the most idiotic decision in history and then we're expected to stick with him for the 30+ hour journey ahead. It's not spoiling much to say that the opening sequence sees our main character voluntarily stick his critically injured wife (who he's infatuated with) on a helicopter headed out of a zombie apocalypse because he feels more obligated to take care of his motorcycle-club drinking buddy. That opening sequence feels lazy, moronic, and uninspired.

The story takes off from there and does a reasonable job of introducing you to new characters, acquainting you with the the shape of the new world, and feeding you crumbs about how to find your missing wife. The main character comes across gruff and unlikeable, but I eventually found that he became a more interesting person about 2/3 of the way through the story; there is some character development there but it's a bit shallow. Secondary characters aren't given much development beyond typecasting, in my opinion. Redneck conspiracy theorist, traumatized teenage girl, and insane religious cult leader are all present (among others). There's some small twists and turns, but largely the story fits into some predictable beats. It's nothing ground breaking.

What the game nails pretty well is atmosphere. The game takes place in a fictionalized version of central and southern Oregon (around Bend, where the studio that makes this game is based). I live here, in southern Oregon and have visited some of the real places that are featured in this game. This game takes place in my back yard and they did a pretty fantastic job of shrinking some of Oregon's greatest features into a relatively small open-world map. There are real places, real landmarks, and references to real cities (big and small) that genuinely made me smile. The world isn't incredibly detailed or anything, but it's fits the style and it feels a lot like home, minus the zombies.

The gameplay here is pretty standard 3rd-person craft-em-up open-world survival 'horror' stuff. It doesn't do a single thing uniquely here, it's almost quite literally cookie-cutter design. I will say however that M+K controls are a heaps better than playing with a controller on the PS4. I played on medium difficulty and only felt challenged when dealing with enormous groups of enemies (called Hordes). Ammo is more than plentiful but I found myself struggling to find the right crafting components for some items. I guess one of the selling points of the game is that you get to ride a motorcycle around and you have to care for it by keeping it tuned up and making sure it has enough fuel. It's really just a little resource management that is required to get you from A-to-B. You can run out of fuel and your bike can be damaged too badly to continue to ride, making you look for fuel or 'scrap' to repair your bike. I never once ran out of fuel, though. The bike handles well and is upgradeable over time and customizable with paint schemes and other visual upgrades.

It's a good game, honestly. It's not awful and it's far from a masterpiece, but I just can't get into it. I kept feeling obligated to finish the game rather than wanting to play it. I wanted to see the end of the story only for the satisfaction of having finished it, not because I was actually gripped by the story or characters. It's easily forgettable but it'll definitely provide entertainment. Perhaps I've been spoiled by some truly monumental games from the last decade. Perhaps my tastes have become overly sophisticated and I'm now a video game snob, but at the very end of this long-winded rant I can't honestly say "Yeah, go ahead and buy Day's Gone, I thought it was great." I can't honestly say that.

A friend of mine was showing off pics of this game, and that was my draw. The graphics are extremely life-like, and he didn't give away any spoilers. The game was bought for me by my brother, immediately after I placed it on my "Wish-list" and I was instantly captivated.

I have a limited collection of Zombie games, and my favorite is the State of Decay series. In-fact, there are many aspects of this one that reminds me of that one.

I'm not very deep into the game, but deep enough to know I'm enjoying it, and that's all that matters to me. It runs smooth on both my PC's, and the story is intriguing. The mechanics are easy enough to learn, and the graphics will blow your mind. The music is immersive too. This game works perfectly on Win7, despite what the Win10 elitist say (I have both).

The privacy issues you'll no doubt see on the forum doesn't concern me, because I don't allow any game to access my files. A simple search on the WEB can show you how to do this, and there's even a GUIDE for this game to educate you on how to do what I already knew. It's worth a read, and the procedure works for a vast majority of games, not just this one.

I give this a 9/10 rating. It's not perfect, but no game is. Catch it on sale, and give it a spin, but watch the Refund Clock. 2 hours on this addictive game, can go by in a flash.

It's pretty fun. It's not awful, but not great; pretty run-of-the-mill zombie survival action. Not recommended due to a gamebreaking bug that prevents me from loading manual saves.

So, I've played this for about 20 hours of a 60 hour game so understand this review is based on what is basically 1/3rd of the storyline. So far, I really don't understand the mediocre reviews this game got. I mean, there are rough parts, but overall this is basically Red Dead Redemption 2 in zombieland. What's not to like? The storyline is plodding and a little boring, okay, but the missions are fairly varied so far and seem fulfilling for the most part. If these same formulas get repeated for the next 40 hours? I think I'll still really enjoy it.

Biggest Pro:
Touring around on the motorcycle, with random encounters popping up everywhere. It's just fun and feels like how I imagine being a biker gang enforcer post-apocalypse would be. Immersion, yo.

Biggest Gripe:
But this is what breaks the immersion. Deacon St. John's combat abilities are basically Keanu Reeves, Master Chief, and Batman all rolled into one. Even on hard mode, he can take multiple shots to the head, multiple zombie claws to the face, and even burn up a bit from a molotov cocktail and still keep dishing out the pain. One normal Deacon who is not special except that he has been in the army and very occasionally injects NERO ♥♥♥♥ juice into his veins, versus a camp with 30 zombies and 15 marauding bandits? Dude does it one handed with just his pistol and his boot knife, with the other hand being used for flipping off everyone in his general vicinity. Need to heal? Cool, no problem, just use 2 spongebob bandaids to go from death's door to olympic athlete condition. Want to slow down time, Matrix-style,so you can 1-shot those 4 zomboys charging you? You know Deacon St. John is basically The One for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason, so he got you covered. Want to craft crossbow bolts/spongebob bandaids/car filter silencers all while sprinting away from a 100+ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ zombie horde? No problem, McGuyvre Batman St. John has got you. He made the bolts out of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ twigs and a pepsi can but they'll ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ headshot a zomboy from 50 yards away dawg. Anyway, Deacon is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for all the freaker/marauder/cultists out there and that fact is never explained in the game well.

Also, all the bad guys are stupid as ♥♥♥♥. How about you tie me up and then I'll keep talking ♥♥♥♥ at you even though you could literally take a tackhammer to my nuts anytime you pleased. Or, hey, you just shot out both my kneecaps but let me keep talking about how I smashed in the girls head that you're here to kill me for. The villains are so one-dimensional that there is never another side to the story. It's just "I are bad and you is not" dumbasses all the way through and that is less than interesting.

I got the Platinum trophy for this game on PS4, so this will mainly be about the game itself. But as far as PC performance goes: From my very brief time in the game it seems to be running well (I've got an i7 8700k, 3080, 16GB RAM on an external hard drive and through the opening segment I had a pretty much constant 100fps at 3440x1440).

As for the game itself, make no mistake: this game has problems. Across a lot of the internet/Reddit it gets labeled as an "underrated gem" which I do struggle with, because (to me, anyways) that implies that it's a really great game, it just didn't get the attention it deserved - which I don't agree with. The game has a lot of problems. However, I still enjoyed it immensely and just want to make sure that you know what you're going into - the game is definitely a solid 7/10 experience.

The good: my favorite part about the game is definitely the characters. I think that Sam Witwer does a really wonderful job as Deacon - he strikes a good balance of hopeless/uncaring, while you can also see that he's got a heart deep down. His character does have this habit of muttering to himself which can get annoying, but other than that he's really great and definitely a large part of why I enjoyed the game so much. Most of the supporting cast is really good too. The story has a fairly slow first half, but the second half picks up a lot more and was a lot more engaging. Honestly, from the various discussions I've had over the internet, your enjoyment of this game will likely come down to if you like the characters or not.

Other good things include: overall world design. If you are unaware, this is developed by Sony Bend, which is located in Bend, Oregon. As such, they had the game take place in Oregon and their recreation of it is really quite gorgeous. The environments aren't too varied (the three main types are forest, desert, and snow), but what's there is really beautiful. And while the game does bear some similarities to TLOU, I feel like setting the game in Oregon along with the general focus on the biker gang "aesthetic" helps set it apart. Also, the hordes are incredibly cool. Seeing a wave of zombies basically copy/pasted from World War Z all scrambling over each other to chase you is a pretty frightening experience. Especially if you're trying to get into position and accidentally set them off.

The "fine": most of the open world stuff. This game's open world design is straight out of the early PS4/Xbox One era's playbook: you have a big open map that's covered with 'fog' that you clear up as you drive around. There are bandit camps, zombie camps, collectibles, crafting materials, weapons, upgrades (for you and your bike), etc. Most combat encounters can either be handled with stealth or just guns blazing - the stealth is functional, but the combat isn't great. None of it is outright bad (aside from combat, which will be touched on later), but it's been done a million times before, and in a lot of examples it's been done better. I'm not as sick and tired of open worlds as others are, but if you're really exhausted by the "generic open world" type of design then you likely won't care for this game.

The bad: The worst part about the game is definitely the combat - it's really not great. It's not unplayable, but it's by far the worst part of the game. Melee combat is very clunky (for example if you swing at a nearby enemy, if you're close enough you'll "lock on" to them and basically zoom over to them to hit them, rather than just swinging and missing) and gun handling doesn't feel particularly great. It's hard to explain exactly what it is about it that doesn't click, but it just doesn't feel particularly good to engage in. Also, the game is a little long for my tastes. When finally getting the Platinum trophy on PS4 I had 52 or 53 hours of gameplay clocked. This will obviously be shorter if you just focus on the main story, but as mentioned before with the story pacing issues in the first half of the game, I think that they definitely could have cut down on the size of the world/story length a bit.

In summary: For me, experiencing the game's characters and exploring their really beautiful rendition of Oregon was more than enough to outweigh the poor combat and generic open world elements. The game has this weird charming sort of "scrappy underdog" feel to the entire thing that really clicked with me. But if you dislike the characters or are really tired of the open-world formula then chances are this game won't be for you.

Fantastic game, a mix of Witcher 3 and Mad Max gameplay with infected being force of nature akin to 28 Days Later.

Incredible physics realism in combat, absurdly satisfying!
Visuals are fantastic - runs really good and looks even better!
Facial animations - best I've seen yet!
Strong story and some interesting twists.

Because of the above, the atmosphere is truly enveloping, you can enjoy the weather or shoot ♥♥♥♥ up to great satisfaction. A lot of collectibles and weapons. Would have liked even more customisation.

Definitely recommend! Easy 'YES' if above points appeal to you. I'm looking forward to Days Gone 2,3 and so on if it sticks to this formula!

Strong suggestion to start game on Hard difficulty. Ask for tips if necessary :)

This game starts out generic but honestly develops into an somewhat-intriguing story with a rich and beautiful world. The protagonist is a static character and it gets pretty old hearing his intermittent ranting, but the plot is engaging, and the world building is well done. The hordes are a lot of fun and the use of bikes really separate this game from other zombie titles I've played. The environments are incredibly detailed, reminding me of a better looking far cry 5. It's an excellent for a port too. I wish it could get a sequel.

This is an extremely underrated game, Days Gone might seem like an ordinary open world game but it's really not, when I started playing this, it became one of the best games that I have ever played.

Open world environment along with such mind blowing details, the story was ultimately satisfying but it's not groundbreaking or anything, it had its own flaws but I don't think this would disappoint any player.

This is most likely the best open-world zombie game you have over there, if you don't like those funky huge mutated monsters that spit acid and glow in the dark.

This game greatly overstays its welcome. I still recommend it, but with some serious caveats. Let's start off with what's good, though.

Pros:
The game world feels genuinely dangerous. Even in late game, you still need to be pretty careful when you're out and about. You never really hit a point where you start to feel invincible and one wrong move can see you die spectacularly
A lot of people say the gameplay is generic and I can't disagree with that. Still, I can't really say it's bad either. If you've played a third-person cover shooter on console before, you already know more or less what to expect.I had fun with the combat, up until it got tedious due to the sheer length of the game.
The game is really pretty. The gameworld really sells the idea of this being an abandoned wasteland. It feels quite alive too. Especially with the contrast between day and night. During the day you'll usually run into human enemies and the occasional pack of hungry wolves. At night, freakers are out in force and you really have to be careful while traveling or stopping anywhere. It also forces you to plan better, because running out of gas in an area with a lot of freakers is not a good idea.

Cons:
The story is kinda boring and bland and there is never a consistent narrative. The plot just meanders about until eventually it ends. It feels like the writers didn't really know what story they wanted to tell and instead just stitched together a bunch of smaller stories. It keeps hopping around and never settles on a specific narrative.
The story is waaaaay too long. For some people this might be a plus, but for the average gamer it quickly turns into a massive slog. About 25 hours into the story, I was ready for it to end. The story continued for roughly another 15 hours from there.
The game really doesn't respect your time. The main story has a lot of content that should have been side content. Most of it consists of running errands for other characters. There are way too many "walk slowly behind the NPC" sections. Checkpoints are often very poorly placed, so that failing an objective (or dying) makes you lose an unnecessary amount of progress (and often forces you to listen to long-ass dialogue again). Multiple quests involve just listening to someone (or the main character himself) monologue. Multiple times during the story, you have to drive halfway across the map just to listen to the main character talk to a gravestone.
Many encounters are just so... unnecessary. Human enemies will often set up traps for you along the road, one of which is stretching a wire across the road to knock you off your bike. This wrecks your bike, forcing you to repair it before you can continue. Sometimes you'll spot the wire in time and be able to slow down, but even if you're going only 1km/h and lightly nick the wire, a mini-cutscene plays, showing you getting knocked off your bike as if you were going full-speed. Oh, and now your bike is wrecked. Hope you have scrap. Some of the more difficult encounters also rely on not giving you breathing room. There's a particular encounter about 75% of the way in where you have to shoot and reload at an enemy in between rolling out of its way, because it just stays on top of you all the time.
Enemies don't get more difficult, just more tedious. Gun fights all play out roughly the same. Even during the last mission, you're still hiding behind waist-high cover, taking shots at enemies as they pop up. The only difference is that now they wear armor that you have to shoot off first. Just a different form of bulletsponge.
It's quite buggy. I encountered a fair amount of bugs during my playthrough and noticed that any time I left the game running for more than 3 hours, asset loading bugs would get significantly worse. This could be anything from textures not loading in, NPCs not being loaded, etc.

I’d like to preface this review by talking about my expectations going into this game. I want to support Sony games on PC, but I wasn’t sure how far I’d get into Days Gone. Many reviews wrote it off as a mediocre zombie survival game with few redeeming qualities, and despite seeing some highly positive reviews, I came into this game not expecting to like it very much. To illustrate how my opinion on this game changed, you will see my impressions of this game at a few different intervals. Minor structural and gameplay spoilers will be included without using the spoiler tags.

5 hours in – The game is somewhat enjoyable so far but feels rather generic in its presentation and the narrative hasn’t really stuck out to me. It is reasonably challenging on Hard II which I like, and the bike is a lot of fun albeit a bit of a pain to keep refuelling frequently.

15 hours in – While it is clear by this point that Days Gone doesn’t do much inherently new, the considerable variety in the main campaign missions and side activities is very noticeable and appreciated. The narrative has picked up a bit, with the focus at current protecting your best friend, and there’s a really beautiful moment including him where you first travel to realize the map is much bigger than it appears.

25 hours in – The game feels like it’s nearing its conclusion yet I’m still not bored of the gameplay because of the activity variety and progression. The focus of the narrative appears to be more about the characters than the actual plot itself, but the characters are well acted and plenty of good lines have been said. The game gives you sufficient time with most of the main characters in one-on-one side quests which could end up being very long yet remain consistently engaging.

35 hours in – The narrative continued in a different direction, and to serve that, the game shifts in location from where you were before whilst temporarily locking off the previous areas. Most of the missions do boil down to fetch quests, but the term ‘fetch quest’ never came to mind as every time, there was a new challenge to overcome to keep things fresh.

And after 45 hours in, after completing the main story and most side activities, Days Gone left me wanting more. I’ve played hundreds of games throughout my time, and this is one of the few where I’d say it keeps getting better the more you play. It is very much a slow burn in terms of gameplay ideas and character moments, with most of the best bits appearing later on in your journey.

The combat remains consistently enjoyable because it’s one of those cases where you get better but your enemies don’t get any stronger. New enemy units are introduced as you progress, and you only don’t see them at the start as their appearance will make your life harder. The health and damage of all of them is the same at the start and end of the game, and so as you level up, obtain better weapons and scavenge more materials, you will be better equipped to completing combat scenarios. The progression also applies to your bike, which is fun to drive from the start but increasingly becomes more useful as you progress, with greater fuel capacity, durability and top speed. Honestly, this game is more of a survival-lite than a full-on survival game; resource management and crafting is pretty simple, and you rarely need to head to the menu to craft something you need.

The game remains challenging though, as your enemies increase in number and the design of each combat area introduces something different to deal with. Each area has a very unique layout to it which means it is very difficult to approach the same activity in the same way every time, and some of them have unique attributes to them; one bandit camp for example contains a horde situated in this kind of waterless moat, which makes going loud a pain if you cannot remain in stealth, but also opens up an opportunity to lure them onto the camp to eliminate the human enemies.

Within-activity variety is where I think this game shines the most. Activities involving detective footprints start off basic, but I quickly realized that they never repeated themselves, whether leading you to an enemy to catch in an interior or exterior, lead you on a scripted wild good chase as part of Deacon's goal to find a friend, or my personal favourite, turning the concept on its head by resulting in the player being captured by some bandits as the footprint trail intentionally led to a trap. NERO checkpoints, which require you to turn on the power of a designed-to-be temporary outpost, require you to make the area safe before entering the building, or the zombies will come flowing at you in great numbers. The large zombie hordes are present throughout the game, though they become their own activity instances later on; these are already inherently fun to tackle by themselves, seeing them move through the world was honestly a sight to beyond, and the game keeps with the environment variety. Simply put, while the objective for each type of activity is exactly the same every time, I never felt like I was ever repeating something I had already done, which I would say was the case for say, a modern Ubisoft-published game or HZD.

As I previously mentioned, the narrative itself isn’t anything to write home about, and if you stopped for a bit to think about what may happen, you’ll probably get it right. However, it is the characters and acting that shine here. The acting in this game feels incredibly natural, with most sentences including stutters or pauses whilst not feeling forced, with only the game’s most domineering characters breaking this rule. Certain traits of characters aren’t explicitly mentioned but are insinuated, hence adopting a show-not-tell approach to learning about the nuances of each character. I found Deacon to be a very interesting protagonist because of the above character design choices; he has a big heart deep down, yet the situation has clearly taken a subtle yet significant mental toll on him, with a few lines coming off completely unhinged or even psychopathic. You will not like him at first, but stick with it, maybe your mind will be changed.

My negatives for this game aren’t huge, but they do add up to hurt this game a bit:
- AI pathing can be off at times, objects and characters get stuck in places where they shouldn’t, and in a couple of instances, part of the game will simply not load, requiring a game restart to fix. However, these problems weren’t consistent.
- The game doesn’t do much that’s completely new, though it does what it does very well.
- Some dialogue can come across as cringe at times, especially on second viewing.
- There are multiple instances where your movement is hindered and you are forced to walk slowly and follow someone without any option to skip. At the very least, the game should give you complete control over your character in these instances.
- There’s a point within the story where you lose your gear completely, and unfortunately you do not recover all of the resources you invested. I get this makes sense narratively, but it is annoying that you are forced to re-scavange everything you lost just because the story said so.

Overall, I think Days Gone has taught me an important lesson. No matter what others say about a game before I play it, at the end of the day I shouldn’t judge it until I try it for myself. And thankfully, I was able to put those expectations aside and try this game, as I was not expecting to enjoy Days Gone as much as I did. It’s rare that a game comes along and is so enjoyable that I stop playing other games temporarily to focus on it, and also play it for more than three hours in certain sessions whilst not feeling bored. This game is certainly not for everyone, but I think it’s much better than some people make it out to be. I hope the game does get a sequel one day, as the final revelation presents some very interesting opportunities. 9/10.

Huge breath of fresh air -- the last couple years has been a joke for decent releases in the games industry. Not so with this title. It's brilliantly written, great characters and voice acting, intense combat, robust system design, beautiful graphics. It's nothing short of a masterpiece in my eyes, and it's a total mystery to me how Sony brushed off a pitch for a sequel.

Great work, devs. Seriously impressive work. And Sony, if you're reading this, you should be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ashamed of yourselves for not pursuing this franchise further. What a damn travesty & waste of potential and talent.

This game is one of the best story games I have played. Most of the main and side characters are funny and interesting with unique personalities and traits. Graphics are great and it runs over 100 FPS constantly at 1440p w/ max settings on a 3080. The massive zombie hordes are an actual threat and can end you quickly if you aren't geared up and armed to the teeth. While there are the typical open world copy & paste side activities like clearing bandit camps, zombie nests and collecting NERO injectors (each injector provides a boost to 1 of 3 main stats), I find them all fun even if they are often seen as repetitive and annoying. They really nail the bike mechanics and overall feel. Constantly having your bike with you makes it become a part of the player, and although not as in depth, reminds me of Horses from Red Dead Redemption 2 except you don't constantly talk to your bike and pat it on the head.

This is one of the first games in my opinion besides The Last of Us, (TLoU 1 not it's terrible sequel) that really does the post apocalyptic atmosphere right. There are corpses, zombies attacking AI survivors and wildlife and traffic jams all over. Accidents and hazardous conditions like flooded roads, roads destroyed by mudslides, roads blocked by trees or vehicles plus many other set pieces can be seen throughout the massive open world map. Combined with the soundtrack it gives you a creepy and unsettling feeling as if you can be attacked by zombies, bandits or predatory animals at any moment. I've gotten side tracked time after time to look at many different aspects of the environment. Bend did a really good job at creating an immersive world. There is a photo mode as well, which only makes the number of times I get sidetracked worse for me.

My only gripe? The stupid, and very unnecessary data collection policy. Sony this is a single player story game, there is literally nothing you need to collect data wise. I don't care if its "anonymous", its a problem and needs to stop. 'not going to trust a huge corporation when they tell me my data is "anonymous". While I would really suggest that the data collection is removed from the game, I am well aware Sony wont do it.

Overall besides the data collection ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Bend Studios did a fantastic job here, and this makes me really happy to see what other PS-exclusive titles will be making their way to Steam. 8.5/10.

This game has such a rich story with rich, complex characters. All of them have their history, a reason for being who they are and acting how they do.

The game is so immersive that empathizing with the protagonist (Deacon - or Deek) happens naturally. You grow to like, love or hate characters as much as Deek does. The voice acting is superb and the cinematics are great, I don't think I've skipped a single one thorough my gameplay. The story takes some big turns - from heartwarming to heartbreaking - which really moves you.

On top of all that add a great gameplay, great control, good progression, amazing graphics... And you have a masterpiece at your hands. Totally worth it even at full price!

Maybe I didn't give this game a fair chance, but it definitely feels very generic in the zombie genre.
Gorgeous graphics and gameplay that seems to take inspiration from Last of Us. I can give it that!

But. It feels like you're just scavenging for resources 24/7 and its boring, uninspired.
The nests that you're supposed to clear just feel so generic and almost like a side mission, yet they makeup much that the open world has to offer.

Maybe I'm wrong! But I didn't get a good impression from my first hours.

I wasn't expecting anything since people just ♥♥♥♥ on this game when it was released on PS4, only heard bad stuff... and I really don't get it, this game is a masterpiece.

The game looks incredible, runs like butter, this game should be praised for how well it was ported on PC.

The graphics are amazing and this is very important as you immerse yourself in the game and enjoy the views all the time. It just blew me away constantly, it's not Red Dead Redemption 2 but it's not far from it.

The story is incredible, I really loved it, no doubt this game has some of the best writing and dialogues out there. Every character in this game is believable. Every dialogues is full of life and the actors who plays deacon should be praised.

The gameplay is more than good enough, is constantly changing. There are сhase, shooting, adventure, survival horror. And most importantly, all this is perfectly balanced.

The graphics, gameplay, story and driving are all top notch. And the main thing is that nothing gets boring during the passage. I usually don't finish games until the end due to imbalanced gameplay, simply because it gets boring to play until the end. But Days Gone is just fine and balanced.

I think the developers know their stuff. It can be seen that they tried very hard on this game and everything was done with love.

If you like adventure games with great story and gameplay then you MUST buy and play Days Gone.
Such games like this one are rarely released.

This game is a good blend of state of decay without annoying side quests and what a walking dead game should be. Sense of progression is really well done and killing hordes in the late game is icing on the cake. Same can't be said for mission progression as they are mostly on the easy side from the beginning. There is not much sense of threat or danger at least not on normal difficulty.

Gameplay loop of go - kill - repeat is satisfying, Weapons are tight and have sense of impact. My only gripe is how aiming and shooting is done when there is a zombie next to you. Where you aim the camera and where shots go is not the same so its really hard to play. It might be on purpose to force melee in the early game. It's such a small gripe that I would still highly recommend to go play if you want to shoot zombies.

Now for the main gripe I have is how the storytelling and delivery of quests is done. Don't get me wrong, story is nice and engaging but sooo freaking long. It's a zombie game, I want to shoot zombies. I don't wan't to explore 10 different character motivators on why he is doing what he is doing. Put more storytelling in camps and world versus linear story. Make me feel the struggle of everyday people in this environment. Game has a very good setting for making you care about camps outside of go kill to get credit but it doesn't do it. You are also forced to go around and explore for collecting materials but besides that there is not a lot of story building via the game world. Only pieces I've found are around NERO sites.

Delivery of quests is via radio and it's the most broken thing ever. Overlapping voice lines, quests out of sync or not triggering. Imagine you finished a quest and you need to get a new one in parallel while traveling to a third one. Finished quest has you reporting success, then while you travel the second dialog should start but you already arrived to the third one so it started a cutscene and now dialog is interrupted. From that point on it's kinda random (broken) when the dialog for the second one will appear and show you the mission on the map. I had instances of this happening all the time sometimes getting the quest after I already forgotten it was interrupted.

Again I would still highly recommend this game for the simple enjoyment of killing zombies and hordes.

Deacon is a daddy who is low-key a softie at heart..

Best part is that its not still gate-kept on PS4. PC version is improved on the PS4 version and I recommend at full price.

After getting some hours in this game and quite literally just eating away at the story where other than repetitive hostage missions that all look like the same dude, I can say its amazing! The story is interesting and has so many good twists in it! Through flashbacks the game does a great job of showcasing certain skills or elements of the story without it feeling forced.

Crafting wise this game makes it so much easier and doesn't require much effort to master that, balancing ammo after a while, and even first aid kits.

World wise, its beautiful, huge and feels authentic and less closed than what you may expect from a game like this. The game isn't so much for random exploring other than random encounters, but when going through the story to unlock new locations and groups of people it makes the game so much more authentic.

The game itself if you like zombies in general, have watched "I am Legend", played "The Last of Us", and "State of Decay", you will find is very well designed in every aspect.

Full kb&m remapping, toggles for everything, option to skip QTE(Or turn into hold), ok mouse sensitivity(Can be increased further through .ini), on-screen keyboard works.
With my disability personally Days Gone PC is the most accessible game this year....I'm absolutely shocked..

As a disabled gamer, thank you.

Absolutely everything about this game was great, at no point when i was playing was i left wanting more. the story and character development was perfect and overall i hope more games are made like this one. No lying to the player, no cash grabs, just a fun and enjoyable game with much to do. Overall: 8/10 (absolutely no complaints with this game, just wish it lasted a bit longer, still around 40 hours tho, it was just so good i wish there was more)

Fantastic PC port. It has 21:9 Ultrawide support and 60+ fps with amazing choices for graphical quality. Even on my Ryzen 7 2700x, 16gb's of DDR4 RAM 3200mhz and a EVGA 1070 SC the game runs very well at Medium/High settings at 1080p 21:9 2560x1080 Ultrawide resolution. Keep these PC ports coming Sony. Next bring us God of War and Bloodborne at 21:9 UW and 60+fps and you will make so much money.

When everyone talked about how great Horizon Zero Dawn looked when it came out and then I finally played it on PC, I wasn't impressed. It looks good but not jaw dropping. Now when I loaded up Days Gone with mostly High settings even at 1080p resolution, my god this game looks fantastic. Make sure you download the latest Nvidia drivers, maybe this is why I am getting such good performance running at 66-70fps on my 75hz UW monitor on a 1070 with the settings turned up pretty good.

Very High SSGI lighting seems to hurt the most on my performance but it just looks so much better than the SSAO High Lighting setting, so if you can run it I would. I just wish we had gotten the PS5's Very High Lighting where it runs SSAO in the distance and SSGI in the foreground to give better performance. Maybe they can add this in at some point if they're thinking ahead, but so far this is a wonderful PC port of a Sony game. Much better than Horizon Zero Dawn which had some really bleh anti-aliasing at 1080p and just looked OK on my monitor.

There's even an FOV slider unlike Capcom put in for Resident Evil Village. FOV sliders are mandatory and this game has one. I gave RE Village a thumbs down simply because it didn't have an FOV slider and it's default FOV was like 60 or something ridiculous.

Also holy crap this is the first Playstation 4/5 PC port that allows you to use the touch pad to access the same playstation features that were on console. You can use your PS4 controller's touch pad to access the menu's. This was the biggest disappointment when I played Alien: Isolation being the fact that the light bar did not pulse with the Motion Tracker like it did on console. That was such a big disappointment in that game but it seems like Days Gone is nearly a perfect PC port and I hope they keep these coming.

Watch Digital Foundry's video on this game that JUST came out. I also praise the graphical menu in this game as it shows you in real time what each option changes and how it looks and how it affects your FPS. Every Single PC Game should have this feature, and in comparison RE Village looks ancient with it's graphics menu.

This is the section for gripes and problems I have with the game, I pray any or all of these could be fixed but that's only if they read this review after I've edited it:

In 21:9 Ultrawide there is no option to change the position of the UI to be Centered or on the Edge. It's default is on the far edges and unlike in the Master Chief Collection there is no way that I can find to change the UI to be more centered and easier to read, IF you want the option to do so. Having the minimap in the far far bottom right corner means I forget that it's even there constantly. I tend to change it depending on my mood in MCC so having the ability to reposition where the UI is placed on Ultrawide monitors would have been very forward thinking. This seems like an easy fix if they decide to add it later, and I pray they do.
Also I do wish they had a mouse sensitivity slider for the Binoculars because as of right now it's not the same as moving the camera around and is way too low. These are minor nitpicks though.
Speaking of minor nitpicks I wish you could press the E key instead of Enter when trying to Continue through menu screens, as well as use the Mouse 4 as a Back key when wanting to go back in a menu instead of having to reach up and press Escape every time.
Even with Camera Follow Tracking turned off the camera will still follow your movements with a mouse and keyboard quite a lot, which gets pretty annoying after a while. You can tell this game was made with a controller in mind and they didn't pay a ton of attention to how it would play with a mouse and keyboard with minor annoyances like this.
This is probably my main gripe because I like to drive around on the bike using my controller, then run around and shoot with the mouse and keyboard for easier headshots. The big problem is if you're crouched or running around your camera's mouse sensitivity can go way down if you're trying to quickly look around to check for freakers in your area or whatever. Even with Camera Following Tracking turned off there is a major issue with the game camera preventing you from moving your screen in the direction you want easily.
I pray they fix this issue soon since it seems to be a holdover from them porting the game to PC and not thinking too much about mouse and keyboard users. Having to hold E to basically do anything is really annoying, shooting zombies with a gun and having them swipe you a second later when it should stun them, not having the option to just tap E or left click once to open things.. these all seem to be just design flaws with the game in general that they should have fixed.
I'm enjoying the game of course but I could see after 40 hours of playing this and having to deal with these issues becoming extremely annoying.
Just some random gripes I have that I feel like they could fix.. I wish there were more thickly wooded areas to explore, maybe there are but it seems like there's a dirt path or camp or road nearly everywhere even though we're supposed to be in the wilderness. I also hate how there's no focus meter somewhere on your screen when you're not using focus so you know when you can use it again. With the crosshair I really hate how you can get it lined up for a headshot at almost point blank range and then you'll fire a shot and it will go clean past their head. Not sure what is up with that but it seems like the crosshair is not lined up with where your character's model is actually shooting, I can't remember the last time I've seen something like that in a game.
On top of everything you have all the gameplay issues where it seems like this game was going to have way more survival mechanics or be focused more heavily on that but now it's certainly more arcadey with gas running out so fast but gas cans being everywhere yet you can't just put one on the back of your bike.
I'm playing my first time on Standard difficulty and how many times did I shoot a Wolf at point blank with an M4 rifle and not kill it? It was about 5 times. I hate how the freakers can take that many rounds at point blank too if you don't shoot them in the head. I can believe a freaker taking more shots since they're infecteds but a Wolf being shot in the face 5 times with a rifle? Yeah that pulls me right out.
I wish you could turn off the sound that going into Focus mode plays when you're looking for gear in the world easier. I hit the button constantly to find things and that loud noise that plays gets annoying very fast.
I hate how different things are in Nick930's video comparing the E3 demo to the Retail release of this game. It sucks you can't play out the giant horde at the Sawmill in the same way the E3 trailer showed. No game is ever the same as the trailers they put out, FEAR 2 Project Origin is an example
With a Boot Knife why do you have to slice a freaker 10 times before stabbing in the head? Just stab him in the head


In the USA the game is only $49.99 and not a full $60 (maybe because there's no multiplayer feature?) but that makes it a bit cheaper when you find it on sale elsewhere so that makes things even better! I am highly impressed by this version of the game and people who have read my reviews know that I am rarely impressed by games or ports anymore. Please Sony! Brings us more of this! Great PC ports with fantastic options and performance for your most well known and beloved games, you would make a fortune!

A great game with a solid story, lots of fun and deep characters. One of the best zombie games I played, despite some game-breaking bugs I've encountered. Definitely worth its price.

Honestly. Been waiting for this game since it came out. Didnt want to get a playstation. Hoped for it to come out to pc. Bam. It had, been waiting months since they teased and omg. The voice over, the story, the gameplay. Astonishing. How tf did this not get good startup on playstation. Had a bug when a cutscene would start and it would stop responding. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ its good.

Much like the journalist outlets who were pretty harsh on this game, I am going to be harsh on it too. Not because it is a terrible game, but because it squandered a lot of opportunity. During the last hour with the game, I thought to myself: this game was probably made by people with a passion for making video games, but who do not have enough time to play games themselves. Besides the pretty scenery and the bike riding, everything else about this game is bland, boring and uninspired. The one thing that is unique and different about this game (i.e. the bike riding) is its whole selling point. Everything else was copy-pasted from somewhere else with no effort to refine it or make it more fun. The story consisted of predictable events, miserable, unconvincing people and a lot of insignificant filler. The protagonist is laughably hard-ass and goes out of his way to be a ♥♥♥♥ every time he opens his mouth. His development from being a gigantic prick to a gigantic prick who gives a speech at the end actually made me roll on the floor with laughter. I don't have anything good to say about the story and its characters - it's ridiculous. The game is open-world but forced to be linear in most sections - resulting in many laughable bugs and encounters. On an RX 6600 XT, I experienced stutter every time I rode around on the bike. Apparently, this is an issue for everyone on all platforms and is a core issue with the game's design.

At the end of the day, there is probably a few good things I could say about this game. But I am so utterly dumbfounded by how bland and boring this game was that this whole review can be summed up in a few words:
What a gigantic waste of time. Don't buy it.

I played it for over 4h now, I must say it reminds me a lot of Mad Max the game and that's not a bad thing because I like that game so much. So far it's really interesting and when it comes to performance it's really good, I have no problems playing the game at 4K locked 60fps at the highest graphical quality available.

Great port of a great title.Everything is well-designed and polished in Days Gone – the believable world and characters in it.
The photo mode is hard to crack but i really liked horizon zero dawn photo mode its very simple. Game kinda gets boring when doing sidequests, story is great and even runs on older computers.
Got it for 12$ worth every penny.

Days Gone
~~~~~~~~~~

When most people talk about console games being ported to PC, the reactions have always been a mixed bag. But I think that is about to change as more and more companies are moving into the PC market and previous console exclusives are being ported one after another. And as the trend continues, ported games are actually getting better, and sometimes much better than the original/exclusive release.

Days Gone is another one of those shining examples. After a huge success on the console side, the fine people over at Bend Studios just brought Days Gone to the PC market.

I must say, not only does Days Gone bring its amazing storyline and gameplay to the table, but it also runs, feels, and looks fantastic. It’s pure eye candy with all the PC juice powering the game’s fine graphic detail.

Plot: After an unknown turn of events, the world plunges into chaos as a rapidly mutating virus swamps the globe. Men, women and children fall sick to the virus and turn billions of humans into feral cannibalistic creatures, called Freakers.

Soon the hordes of Freakers take out everything that moves. The world falls into anarchy, everyone trying to survive on their own terms. The governments go into hiding without lending a helping hand.

This story revolves around our main protagonist, Deacon St. John, ex-army man turned member of Mongrel MC, as well as his new wife Sarah and his close MC friend/brother Boozer.

After losing Sarah, Deacon sets out with his friend and starts life as a drifter, running from survivor camp to survivor camp doing bounty jobs to make a living.

Until one fateful day when Deacon intercepts the NERO Helicopter and runs into O'Brien, the NERO field scientist to whom Deacon entrusted his wife’s protection.

Upon investigation, it’s revealed that Sarah isn’t dead after all. Deacon finds a new purpose in life after having lost all hope of finding her.

Gameplay: One of the biggest Zombie survival games just got a PC port and it’s one of the best ports I’ve encountered in a while. From its amazing story to its mind-blowing gameplay, it just got a visual PC upgrade. The game looks fantastic with all the graphic details being powered by PC hardware.

And when I say the best PC port, I’m not kidding. Throughout my hours of gameplay, I faced no issues whatsoever; it was a seamless experience.

The game starts off on a short cut scene and a thrilling bike chase, and shortly after dials down. After that, the game runs at a slow pace with basic missions and bounties that are just helping you become familiar with the game and its environment, teaching you how this doomed version of the world works.

Going from camp to camp you unlock more of the game’s storyline and missions. You will be mostly going after bounties and solving the puzzle behind the outbreak. Each camp will let you into a certain set of missions that will progress the story as you help out. You’ll gain access to a weapon merchant, machines and other services in return for bounties and other work they ask you to do. Not really a fully proven economic system, but it’s a ton of fun.

Threats: The doomed apocalyptic world can be brutal, full of deadly creatures, wildlife, and most of the surviving human population. The first half of the game is pretty fun, with a good amount of easy-to-kill enemy types. Only one posed some real difficulties and that was the mutated bears.

But the latter half turned out to be pretty insane; even the weak enemy comes at you in larger numbers. And the hordes are literally unkillable without proper loadout and planning. Huh! I never thought I’d need to put this much effort into killing a couple of thousand zombies in a video game, lol!

Even with a proper loadout, it's more difficult than most other zombie games; not only are you facing an insane number of zombies, but they are fast, and they can move in a way that makes you miss your shots.

The bosses are really good as well, bringing a stronger meaning to the story without making it too difficult to beat them.

Weapons: The game features an impressive round-up of weapons, from 9mm to Desert Eagles to .50 Caliber rifles that can be bought from the camps. The gun models look and feel really good (a little bit too good, I would say, for an apocalyptic setting).

I was actually hoping for weapons with a bit of a Mad Max, ragtag, fixer-upper style. Some homemade handguns, maybe?

World design: As you progress through the game, you will slowly unlock further into the world. I am quite impressed with how the progression and region unlocking system works. Surprising how such a big playable area can be hidden until unlocked.

Rich and diverse regions, from a dried up region to a snowy mountain region, to a bombed-up war zone. Impressive and very well detailed.

Music and sound effects: Days Gone features an impressive lineup of tracks, setting up appropriate modes for each scenario.

The assortment of sound effects is very rich, from Freaker to wildlife; very impressive stuff. Most of the gunshots, however, sound terrible; this could definitely be improved.

Voice acting: A massive shout-out to the actors and actresses who brought these amazing characters to life with their impressive voiceovers. From Deacon and Sarah to the bosses, they are very well done.

Although I am pretty annoyed by the voiceovers of the people I have rescued; they sound so bad and it gets very annoying since you’re pretty much stuck while they speak.

Positives:

+ Fantastic storyline
+ Multiple endings
+ Insanely fun gameplay
+ Impressive weapons
+ Good assortment of enemy types
+ Well made, mature characters
+ Impressive voice acting
+ Easter eggs and secrets

Negatives:

- Gun sounds can be improved
- Slow story progression
- Needs more unique and insane weapons
- Annoying conversations with people that I have rescued every time
- Minor animation glitches
- Unnecessary slow walks in scenes
- You can walk away and walk faster while interacting with NPCs.

“Oh, damn rain. If it’s not the Freaks, it’s the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rain. Why is it always raining?” Life ain’t easy, but that made us move. So, get out and kill those good damn hordes!

9/10

Excellent game. Everyone's a critic nowadays, with games like Witcher 3, GTA 4 & 5, Red Dead 1 & 2 and Skyrim to name just a few, gamers have become spoiled and expect perfection everytime anyone makes a game. Is this game perfect, no of course not. Is it still a great game thats fun to play? Absolutely.. Instead of seeing only the bad in games, how about try and look for the good and enjoy yourself... Thats why we play games in the first place.

Great game and right now playing with Keyboard and Mice and the controls feel a bit wonky but understandable as the game is a port from playstation. I would definitely try the game with a controller.

Definitely fun for a single player game

Incredibly good game. The port itself is rock solid and performs like a dream (looks like one too!), plays fine with M+KB (disable the 'camera tracking' options and mouse smoothing). Everything about this game screams beauty and I find myself spending almost as much time in Photo Mode as I do playing. Some top-tier facial motion capture, the actors do a great job and the characters faces show all the little emotions and movements.

As far as the game goes, it's a real charmer. A slow-burn open world game about folks trying to make it in a world full of danger. I enjoy the characters (some more than others) and unraveling the many stories is engaging. The motorcycle is a major feature and they really captured the weighty feeling of a bike. I don't bother with fast traveling since riding the bike is so fun. Salvaging parts from car hoods to keep the bike in good shape and grabbing fuel where you can sounded tedious but is very straight forward and smooth. It feeds the game without bogging it down.

There's a lot of little things that make up the gameplay loop and all of them work well with each other. Keeping your bike fueled up, coasting down hills to save gas and reduce engine noise, looting cars for spare parts to craft crossbow bolts or fix up that melee weapon you found. Customizing your bike with decals, paint jobs, and parts. Hopelessly trying to hold back a horde of literally hundreds of enemies with only 30 bullets to your name. The enemies are dangerous if you have to deal with more than one and shooting a gun is likely to bring everything within earshot screaming towards you. But don't worry, there's no scrape you can't get out of with your trusty bike (you did remember to fill up the gas tank, right?).

At first, you'll be very weak and even a couple Freakers will take you down but as you continue, you'll become not only stronger through your weapons and abilities, but you'll start to understand how to approach different enemies and how to plan ahead. Setting up traps, using the lay of the land, parking your bike somewhere where you can run and get to it easily. This kind of planning is crucial for success but being able to think on your feet when your bike is knocked over and you're being chased by 40 angry monsters is just as necessary.

There's plenty to enjoy here. If you want an immersive open-world zombie game, it's hard to do much better. In a few words, "Open World Last Of Us". Recommended for: zombie enthusiasts, motorcycle enthusiasts, Oregon enthusiasts

Very addicting in my opinion, the gameplay gets you lost in the game without boring you since you have to come up with different strategies on how to handle certain mobs. Freakers arent a threat in small numbers but when they swarm, and come in numbers you are screwed if you dont find an escape route. The story had me intrigued, and even the main characters backstory has a small amount of interest to it. I highly recommend if you like survival games that require strategy before getting into combat. Had i known this game was this good i would have brought it on release.

i bought it on release played about 25% of the game, got sick of everything video games, \came back a year later to it and was able to pick right up back where i left off which is rare for open world games. i recently completed the main story mission while completing most of the side stuff and i can say it is enjoyable and youll easily get "your moneys worth" out of the content in the game. from what i can tell theres additional ways to play outside of your first main story playthrough, like a limited resources "survival" playthrough of the main story and challenges where you do certain things like last against hordes of zombies, human enemies, etc but im not really interested in those things. the story is decent and i watched all of the cutscenes and only really skipped the optional dialogue things where youll be standing in front of someone watching them talk at you in non cutscenes. the motorcycle riding is pretty cool too, while you can fast travel i actually drove everywhere most of the time besides a few points where i opted to use the fast travel (you use gas that you can find and purchase to refuel your cycle along with using gas for fast travel too so while not too handholdy with the mechanic you can still find it in plethora). im glad it got ported to pc after seeing it ages ago at some e3 thing and feel like its a nice hidden gem of an open world game.

Update: I'm now marking this review as negative after learning about the frankly outrageous data collection being implemented here. I'm uninstalling the game until this absurd aspect is removed from the game. There is no justification for key logging any sort of game, especially an offline-only experience, and I for am deeply disappointed in Sony for doing this.

I already played this game to 100% completion on PS4 back when it first released, and let me tell you - this PC port is worth it, even if you experienced it before. Your reflexes hold true on a keyboard and mouse, but the aiming and performance is far and away the definitive way to enjoy Days Gone.

If you miss open world games that don't copy Far Cry and hard-hitting stories that still manage to have a hopeful message, Days Gone is an excellent time. Deacon starts off like a traditional gruffy grump, but he grows into one of the few nuanced male leads in mainstream gaming. The story is a slow burn that pays of beautifully.

Easily one of my favorite games in the longest time. Ignore the haters calling this "generic" - I feared that'd be the case my first time going in, but I was delightfully surprised. Bend Studios does great work, and this is their finest game yet.

I've played this game for a little over 60hrs now (beaten on Normal difficulty) and overall I like the game. For the most part I didn't encounter very many glitches/bugs so that was a plus, considering the state games are coming out in nowadays (yes I realize this is an older game from the Playstation console). Navigating the map in order to complete your missions (both Main and Side) is pretty straight forward. Theres usually a line/marker to follow which will bring you right to the location you need to be at.

The Crafting in this game is pretty decent as well but could use some improvement which brings me to my first real gripe about the game. For the most part once you've looted something from a location (not including herbs/berries) it doesn't respawn. I was told that items will respawn at Nero Check Points that are throughout the game and I do believe that is the case but outside of that (on roadsides, in towns/buildings, from cars/trucks etc.) they do not. This really isn't an issue until you get towards the end of the game (or just after you've beaten it like I have). You need these resources to help you take out the Hordes (big groups of the Freaker/Zombies enemies) because, while bullets can do a lot of work, having bombs/molotovs etc can help cut through those freakers and save you some bullets.

Its in my opinion that these items should respawn in these locations. It doesn't have to be immediately after leaving the area but make it something like two ingame days then the items will respawn or something to that affect. Yes there is the option for New Game+ but I wanted to complete as much of the game as I could without having to start over (regardless of w/e advantage you get to bring with you). Luckily buying ammo/guns and other items like med packs, flash bangs, grenades/pipe-bombs from vendors is easy and it doesn't take long to get enough credits (you get credits by turning in ears from the freakers you kill as well as any meat you get from the wild life in the game and the herbs/berries you can pick/harvest) to refill you ammo/item supply.

There are many buffs/abilities you can acquire as you level up. I suggest picking up the "Focus Fire" or as I call it the "Slow-Mo" ability. That allows you to slow down time letting you line up headshots (which are generally one shot one kill on most of the weaker enemies). This really is needed because the Freakers tend to twitch a lot when they are moving..some even try and dodge your shots when they are running at you. You want to make sure to look around before taking a shot because any enemies in the area will run to that location to see what made the noise and if they spot you they'll attack/chase you. To help mitigate that there are silencers in the game.

It'll take some time to unlock these as each camp you visit (there are 5 in the game, three you'll come across fairly quickly and two more towards the later half of the game) has three levels of rep/loyalty you'll need to grind for in order to access all of their wares. Copeland's Camp (should be the first came you come across) will only have bike refueling/repairs/upgrades and ammo/item restock options but no weapon purchase options). The next camp you'll come across will be the Hot Springs Camp and thats the one you'll want to grind up rep with first imo.

They'll have everything (or at least a little bit of everything) there to purchase INCLUDING BETTER GUNS!! As you do missions, clear Freaker nests, take out hordes, save npcs and send them to that (or any) camp you'll get credits as well as rep increase. To help with the rep grind you're definitely going to want to get the perk/abilities that increase how much you get from harvesting both plants and animals. You may not get A LOT of rep/credits for each individual turn in but they all add up..trust me.

The next camp is called Lost Lake and that camp has the best weapon/bike upgrades you can get for at least the first half of the game. Once you reach this point in the game any credit source turn in you have (aka meat, herbs/berries and freaker ears as well as sending the npcs you save throughout the game which can sometimes be found on the map when Blue Question Marks pop-up) you'll want to bring here, imo.

Hopefully by now you've realized that each camp sells (or can sell you) "silencers" for each of your type/class of guns (which are broken down into Primary, Secondary and Special) that you have. In order to be able to purchase them (other then having enough money to do so) you'll need to have a certain loyalty level (this also goes for weapons and other items from these same vendors). Once reached you can purchase them again and again (only one for each at a time though) because each "silencer" (they are actually oil filters from vehicles btw) only last a certain number of shots. Once their durability level drops to zero they'll break and you'll need to find (they can be found from vehicles that haven't had their front hoods popped but they are few and far between) or buy a new one. They can't be fixed/repaired.

If you're someone who prefers melee combat over gun combat well...you can sorta scratch that itch in this game but only when there are very few enemies near by. Melee seems like an after thought because (while you can augment/improve your melee ability with other abilities you can get as you level up) you can only attack one enemy at a time. No wide swings that would allow you to take out (or at least damage) multiple enemies at once. Stealth is the way to go (crouch-walking). Sneaking up on them and "one-shotting" them with your knife. You can repair your melee weapons but you'll need an ability you can get from the talent tree in order to do so otherwise they'll break and you'll need to find/upgrade another.

There are places on the map called Nero Checkpoints/Research Camps that all have an item called a NERO INJECTOR which allows you to improve either your Health, Stamina or Focus meter (once you have the focus ability unlocked btw) by 25points each (and there are enough throughout the game that you can fully max out at least two of the three). I went for a mix between Stamina and Focus (never touched health until at the end of the game) because you'll be doing some running once you face off against the hordes of the game.

In case you find a weapon out in the wild (or the ♥♥♥♥ as its called ingame) you can certainly use it but you'll need to find ammo for those weapons and if you drop the weapon to pick up another one..leave the area and come back that weapon will be gone. You don't get to keep any of the weapons you find once you drop them. Only the weapons that you buy are accessible via Gun Safes located at camps throughout the game w/e you want to use them.

I mentioned it before but there are options you can buy for upgrading your bike (which you will need to do in order to get the most of of this game). Upgrading your bike not only allows for it to take more damage before it breaks and you need to find Scrap in order to repair it (the amount it takes to repair your bike can be mitigated by an ability you can pick up in the talent "tree") but also how fast it can go, how far it can go before needing a gas fill up, the amount of ammo you can store on it (you can't store any ammo at the start of the game btw) and how easy it is for the tires to grip the road/surface you're on (to help prevent sliding). Going off of jumps can also damage your bike as well as running into things.
I'm sure theres more I'm forgetting but I'll let you discover the rest for yourself.
I've enjoyed the game quite a bit. Hopefully they'll come out with some dlc for it (probably not considering how long its been out for already). Definitely pick up this game. You enjoy it.

A much welcome PC port of a mediocre game.

TL:DR
• Story: An overly long story, with annoying/arrogant characters.
• Graphics: Open world is beautiful, but close up objects and faces look a little outdated.
• Gameplay: Lots of fun scavenging and killing Zombies. Sometimes even 500 of them at once!
• Audio: Great gun/zombie sounds and a beautiful theme song, dragged down by immersion-breaking voice acting.
• Performance/Bugs: Great running game sadly filled with plenty of bugs.
• Price-Quality: A fair price of £39.99 considering the number of bugs/issues and lack of DLC.
• Final Verdict: 6/10 - Recommended if you are looking for 40+ hours of Zombie-killing fun and don't care too much about the story.

PC SETUP:
• GPU: MSI RTX 2070 SUPER
• CPU: RYZEN 7 3700X
• RAM: 16GB DDR4 @ 3200MHZ
• MOBO: ROG STRIX B450 - F GAMING


Story:
The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic Oregon two years after a global pandemic.
(Hits a little too close to home right now, no?)
You play as "Deacon St. John" who is a former member of a biker gang. After getting separated from his wife Sarah and discovering that she may still be alive, he goes on a journey together with his friend Boozer to reunite with her.

The story is sadly lacklustre, too long and I found it difficult to relate to Deacon.
He's got a "tough guy" attitude which makes him seem like an arrogant a**hole even when he's helping people, which never sat right with me.
Some characters are also written to be VERY stupid, making the same mistakes over and over to give you a reason to rescue them.


Graphics:
The open world is beautiful, but once you get up close to objects and face models, things start to look outdated. The game re-uses A LOT of models for the random "rescue encounters” which has you rescue "the same guy" dozens of times.


Gameplay:
You spend a lot of your time riding around on your customisable bike while scavenging for supplies, crafting items, hunting and fighting. Most enemies consist of other humans, wild animals and Zombies, which are called "Freakers".
There's a lot of mandatory "instant fail if detected" stealth sections and it can be a bit of a “walking simulator” during story/flashback missions.

What makes this game unique in the "zombie survival genre" is the "Horde system" which means that the Freakers like to move in groups that come in a variety of sizes, from 50 up to 500 per group. There are 40 hordes in total. They are hard to face and the fights are hectic but it's super rewarding once you manage to use the environment and your weapons arsenal to defeat the whole horde.

Your arsenal consists of 3 main weapon slots: Primary, Secondary and Special.
You also have a knife and can find melee weapons (planks, baseball bats, pipes etc), which can be upgraded to increase the damage and durability.

There's are also day/night and weather cycles, which affect how enemies behave and how you play.

• Daytime: Sunlight weakens the Freakers, so they hibernate in specific dark locations. There are fewer Freakers outside, but all enemies have normal vision.
• Nighttime: Enemies have reduced vision, but the Freakers are stronger and start to roam around.
• Rain/Snow: Enemies have further reduced vision and sounds are dampened. But more Freakers appear and it's harder to control your bike.


Audio:
Gun sounds are meaty, the Zombie noises are creepy (especially the sounds of an incoming Horde) and the bike sounds ranges from light to bassy depending on what engine you have equipped.

The main theme is beautiful!

However, I have a major issue with the voice acting.
Characters can often be too loud/quiet, i.e during normal conversations, one character can start to raise their voice as if the other person was suddenly far away. It makes things sound very unnatural!


Performance/Bugs:
I had all settings maxed apart from "Shadow Quality" (Medium) and "Cloud/Fog Quality" (Low) which barely affected the quality but provided an increased fps. Only had a few dips below 60 fps in certain areas, but it was never bad enough for it to be an issue.

But I did have issues with bugs, which there were plenty of.
Many times Zombies were glitching into terrain, floating in the air or shooting up into the sky when colliding with certain objects, only to come smashing down into the ground and ragdoll.
Found plenty of people “sitting in their car” in the air, outside of their car and items getting stuck in walls/objects.

The worst bug I came across was when an NPC was missing from an encampment. This meant that I couldn’t hand in the quest that I was on. I had to leave the encampment and fast travel back to fix it. This happened several times.


Price-Quality:
After around 40 hours I had completed the story and quite a lot of side quest/activities, which is a decent amount of time.

I bought the game at release for £39.99 which I think is a fair price considering the number of bugs/issues I mentioned earlier and the lack of DLC.


Final Verdict:
I'm always very happy to see console games making their way over to PC.
However, that doesn't mean I'll go easy on them. While Days Gone's gameplay is solid, the story overstays its welcome and the number of bugs sours the experience.

If you are looking for 40+ hours of Zombie-killing fun and don't care too much about the story, I would recommend this game.


My score: 6/10.



Thank you for reading my review.

Days Gone is a great story game. It is filled with so much it's hard to explain! The story will no doubt have you crying at the end, it's filled with great detail, features and much much MUCH more. The combat and physics are super great and detailed, you can tell they put so much thought and effort into this game and didn't wanna miss out on anything. If you ask me I would highly HIGHLY recommend this game to a friend or family member, anyone can play this game and love it! Once again, I love the game and you should try it! :)

Great port of a great title. Zombie games are all around us, but Bend Studio managed to squeeze every last drop out of this worn out setting. Everything is well-designed and polished in Days Gone – the believable world and characters in it, the distinct post-apocalyptic aura, the crafting, the thrilling combat and spectacular encounters with bloodthirsty hordes. In addition, this version is well-optimised and runs smoothly on a mid-range PC.

One of the most underrated game of all time!

First I wasn't sure If i should buy this game; but after getting it, its been one hell of a blast. I was kind of worries as the Horizon zero dawn port was terrible in the past. Days gone exceeded my expectations. The game is so well optimised on PC. It runs on a solid 70+ fps on my rtx2060 laptop with all the settings on High and my xbox series X controller works perfectly fine with the game. The amount of customisation that the developers offer for video optimisation is one of the best I have came across.

In terms of the actual gameplay, the youtube reviews suggested a slow paced story; Tbh, it didn't feel like a slow burn. The game was actually well paced. The sound system, the graphics, and most importantly the zombies are perfectly balanced. Unlike the other zombie games which encourages you to blast through enemies, Days gone makes you take on tactical approaches to kill the zombies. The hoards were terrifying as seen in the gameplay videos. The bike driving mechanics were top notch; and as a motorcycle enthusiast myself, it felt as if I were riding my own bike in this beautifully crafted open world. The various customisation options, zombie types, the smart AI, weapon handling, sound design, fluid controls, and the story are the key highlights in this game.

I would definitely recommend anyone who wants to try something new. 9/10 from me.

Does anyone else finger hurt from holding the E button. This is another run around collect stuff for other people just like every other game. Nothing new here. Wait till the price goes down or on sale before u buy. Not worth the 50 bucks. Stupid concept for a loud bike and a game to be quite so u don't attract zombies. Hoard den, destroy hoard den to gain control, sound like state of decay 2 rip off. it's like if state of decay 2 and tom clancy had a messed up kid, that is this game.

I still have a feeling that nobody is going to be able to read this but I would like to say this is one of the best open world zombie games I've ever played because the story, characters, and the graphics are absolutely beautiful and well written. I remember the first time I played Days Gone was on my PlayStation 4 console but now I can finally have a chance to experience this on my PC by completing it again so I'm very happy. Don't listen to the negative reviews, just give it a try.

I came into this game skeptical, and left it feeling happy that I gave it a shot. The game is way too long, but I enjoyed almost all of it. It suffers from typical open world game padding and side missions that dont matter much, but i ended up doing them all anyway because I didnt want the game to end. You could probably finish this in about 40 hours, but It took me almost 80 because I was savoring every last bit.

Pros:
Fun gunplay
Varied weapons
Crafting
Exploration
Motorcycle is awesome
Story
Killing hordes is super fun

Cons:

Overall, when it comes down to it, I HIGHLY recommend this game, a solid 7.75/10.

Waited years for this to come out on PC and it finally did. A masterpiece of a game, one of the best zombie apocalypse game out there. Hope PS also releases Ghost of Tsumisha as well

No more PS exclusive games, tyvm

Another great port from playstation to pc. Will review the game itself after ive finished it.

Expect a few bugs here and there like single buttons on controllers being unresponsive in certain situations(on bike). The few bugs will be patched in the next few days/weeks.

This is my third play through of this game, played it twice on PS4. I really suggest this game, don't listen to the negative reviews. The story is really good, the characters are really good, please play this and give it the love it deserves :)

Playstation Studios' second PC release is a quality open-world action game that does most things at a very competent level but doesn't quite have the new ideas and spark needed to push it to true greatness. Nevertheless, Days Gone is well worth the money if you hunger for tens of hours of open-world fun.

I dont get the hate this game generates. I hemmed and hawed about it because of steam reviews then i remembered that steam reviews are eh at best. So i delved into others and found it sounded not bad off but i was concerned as a 21 9 player and someone who HAS to rebind EVERY KEY to ANY KEY on the board. Suffice to say 21 9, supported(unlike any bethesda game) and i coudl remap EVERY DARN KEY(screw you cyberpunk). It runs BEAUTIFULLY at max settings on my ryzen 7, vega 64 setup. not one issue.

I love that i can ride a motorcycle and not have to worry about laying it down unless i drive to stupidly or get smashed by undead or a wolf. its the most fun MC ride ive had in a game since Metal Gear Black. (and yeah ive played the GTA series, wasnt as fun) course it helps im a biker so this biker theme responates with me.

This game does a lot right. sure its not perfect but its fun, playable on highest settings. sure its a bit rinse and repeat but so has been Dying light, all the far cry series, and others.

i just dont get the hate this game garners.

and the story? its better than a lot of rpg lite games that ive played. but again, im a biker maybe it makes me sensitive to the relationship between deke(not deek like hte stupid subtitles say) and Boozer.


overall 4 out of 5 for me.
but hey, i love far cry and that game gets a lot of hate too.

For me, it's a solid port. FPS is consistently over 100+ FPS, max graphics on a 2080Ti. Only issue I have is with the camera on KB&M. There is some weird forced focus on random objects in the world (despite turning those settings off) and feels like I'm constantly fighting it. Other than that, if you didn't get a chance to play on PS4 this is the time to grab it.

Days Gone is my type of game. Post-apocalyptic, check. Exploration, check. Kill zombies, check. I enjoyed the story line and thought it had some meaningful moments that kept me interested enough where I would sincerely look forward to finding out what would happen next. The main story is linear but you can go at it at your own pace and there is plenty of exploration and side missions to do in between each step. The graphics are beautiful!! I found the controls fluid and intuitive. There is plenty of territory to explore and variation of landscapes and land marks. Good variety of enemies and wildlife. Zombie hordes are impressive and fun tackling using different strategies. While minimal there are some RPG elements like skill trees and crafting. And it's just cool riding around on a Harley after the end of the world.

Pros:
-Graphics
-Open world exploration
-Meaningful story
-Variety of weapons and crafting
-Variety of enemies and wildlife
-Plenty of missions and side missions and random events
-Zombie hordes

Cons:
random fps drops

I love open world games, yet I'm scratching my head at this one. I do prefer it being open world, but I'm wondering what the point is when you cannot store the weapons you loot out in the world. You can't store anything you find, actually. Maybe ammo, if you get the bike upgrade? It's just odd, how little the "looting" matters in this open world game. I'm constantly at max capacity for loot items. I'm literally going thru the map seeing loot and not being able to take it, store it, anything. It's very weird. This game feels like a linear Sony game that they made open world just so you can choose what order to do missions. I don't get it, but I still very much enjoy it which leaves me in a weird place. 8.5/10

As many others have pointed out the game runs flawlessly and looks stunning. Even on my outdated hardware (GTX 1070 @ 1920 x 1080) I'm able to max out all graphic options and get well above 60 fps. Definitely recommend this game.

P.S. I seen someone post a unfair negative review due to 'Game Data Collection' software that installs with the game. This can very easily be overcome by adding the game to your firewall which will prevent Days Gone from accessing the internet; or you can use a program like 'SimpleWall' which makes it very easy to do so.

Days Gone is the game I've been waiting for so long after Mad Max. It combines zombie apocalypse, survival and vehicle custumization and wraps it all up in a story-rich setting in a beautifully designed world.

In Days Gone, you play as Deacon St. John, who, along with his biker buddy Booze, barely escape the freaks overrunning their town. His girlfriend Sarah is seriously injured in the process, and through a fortunate circumstance he is able to put her in a helicopter belonging to the mysterious research organization NERO (National Emergency Response Organization), which evacuates her. With the separation from Sarah begins at the same time the search for her and the struggle for survival in a world full of dangers.

There are not only freaks (people mutated by the virus), but also different types of gangs (Rippers, Anarchists, Marauders and other riffraff) and wild animals that you have to be on your guard against. At the beginning of the game you have to be very careful when moving through the game world, and the gameplay is rather defensive due to the lack of resources and equipment. However, the stealth gameplay was a lot of fun for me.

Soon you meet friendly camps, all of which have different characters, and for which you can do missions to get camp credits and better equip yourself and your bike. The gameplay is an entertaining mix of exploring, looting, crafting, reputation farming and bike custumization. There is also a skill tree that you can upgrade as needed. In my opinion, there is no one right way to do it, you just skill what seems most useful at the time. I like that freedom.

Again and again the free gameplay is interrupted/enriched by cutscenes, you can see that how you want. Personally, I was very interested in the story, so I could overlook the fact that some transitions didn't quite fit the time of day. For the abundance of cutscenes, the developers did quite well. I think the story(s) give the game an unusually dense atmosphere. All the drama, tragedy and associated emotions are really well portrayed.

As the game progresses, more and more of the story unfolds and Deacon becomes more experienced and better equipped. It's really fun to race through the landscape on the bike. The setting is a free-roaming, open game world that offers random encounters in addition to the aforementioned enemies and characters. Thus, you'll stumble across captured hostages that you can free, loot-rich small camps, ambushes by highwaymen or the like again and again. The game world offers a lot of variety at all times, and it never gets boring.

Later in the game, a second large game area even opens up, which features significantly more difficult enemies. My character was already quite well equipped at this point, so I got away from stealth gameplay more and more. Just shooting into the mob with the machine gun has its own charm ;) However, the second area is also very demanding in terms of resources. Many nests have to be smoked out and many zombie hordes have to be wiped out. Especially in the latter I experienced a few bugs, such as that the horde suddenly stood next to me. Those were some heart attack moments. :D

I'm not completely through with the story yet, but what I've experienced so far is really fabulous. I love this game and can recommend it to anyone who likes apocalyptic open-world settings. Days Gone is an addictive game with an incredible amount of gameplay and great storytelling. Even though there won't be a Days Gone 2 for the foreseeable future, I'm looking forward to the announced "sequel" from Bend Studios!

Days Gone is an masterpiece of a game made by the talented crew at Bend Studios. Looking out on the vast landscape of the Oregon woods with the snow falling down all around me and hearing the eerie music and soundscape of the world of this game, you could seriously not tell this was a debut AAA game from Bend.

The story follows Deacon St John (played by the excellent Sam Wither) looking for clues relating to his beloved wife, all while trying to survive the harsh world around him and protecting all those close to him. The story was a surprising positive as I walked into Days Gone expecting a mediocre tale, to be welcomed by a lavish multi threaded story of the highest calibre, supported by excellent voice acting and mo-cap work by the team which makes everything feel real.

I have seen a lot of reviews comment on the repetitive nature of the missions and whilst I can say there were not as much of a variety as I would have liked, they were a solid selection and no different from titles such as Spider Man with a core number of activities you do whilst working through the 30-40 hour story. I have enjoyed every mission of the game so far in the almost 40 hours I have played with the story and game-play mechanics keeping me engorged with the world of Days Gone.

During the game you will clear out camps and Freaker nests as-well as other mission types intertwined with story missions with set pieces and a more narrative direction as well as side quests. This is a game anyone can pick up and enjoy, with good enough gun controls and a decent handling of Deacon's trusty bike.

The Freaker hordes although not being featured as much as I would have expected are a worthy inclusion and a technical marvel by John Garvin and his team of wonderful designers. I have never felt so tense when having a horde ranging from 150-500 in size all screaming and chasing me, with little ammo and having to use the world around me to pick them off.

Days Gone makes you creative and get to grips with not just going in guns blazing every encounter, you will want to use stealth to your advantage as well as melee weapons and throwables to help you out when under pressure from enemy attacks.

You can tell this game was made with passion from everyone involved and I hope the harsh critics reviews do not deter Bend from making more wonderful titles as they can only go up from here. This game is a must buy for any fan of the genre and is worthy of being part of Sony's exclusive collection.

Absolutely fantastic suvival zombie game and an amazing port/pc version.

Also, one of the best looking games out there and it still runs buttersmooth even on my mid-range pc. Playing on the following system: 8700k, 32 ram, 1080ti, SSD.

If you´re into survival games, stealth and enormous zombe hordes to defeat: Look no further :)

Don´t forget to choose Survival II difficulty.

Very fun game. I was skeptical to get it for years but my uncle kept convincing me to get plus with the summer sale, I finally got it. It's a perfect mix between the last of us and red dead redemption. The game has me hooked for hours without getting bored.

“Promise to ride me as much as you ride your bike”- Sarah. (hehe we all know this line cmon!)

First of all i would like to say that Days gone is a fantastic game in many different ways. The pc port is remarkable compared to MANY other Ported games. It looks and runs incredibly with no frame rate issues, stuttering, freezing e.t.c. 10/10 performance. It has better driving/driving physics than most games. The motorcycle is very well tuned and it is almost perfect for how the bike should respond to turning, falling and rolling forward and back. It has some of the BEST melee i have seen in a long time from games, its brutal, bloody and its feels very heavy (you are using a bat with nails e.t.c)

secondly (and shortly) WORLD WAR Z should take hints from this game. This is the way zombies should horde and act/respond to noise. (OFC use the pyramid thing they do DUHH)

Lasty (something that kinda sucks) Story wise.... it kinda lacks in terms of character improvement... E.X Deacon has these weird boring "non interactive" flashbacks of his wife sarah which play out so, so slow as like many people would say its "like a school drama". It does get a but repetitive but name a game that isnt.... ill wait.

Buy this game so sony keeps putting PS games on the steam marketplace. You will not regret picking the game up either. 10/10 no issues so far!

Absolutely one of the most amazing games I have played. The game is beautiful. The story is so good it kept me wanting to play non-stop. It gave me a roller coaster of emotions and not many games can do that to me. The characters are so great and I became very attached to many especially the main character Deek that you play as. The game play was so fun and varied that I never got bored. The first time I accidentally ran into a horde I about peed my pants. LOL. What an amazing experience. There is also many things to do still post story to keep you engaged in playing. Ran very well for me on RTX 2060. One of the best games. I really truly hope Bend can make a Days Gone 2 some day as this was such a great game. 10/10 i would definitely run into Horde of Freakers by accident again!! Planning on playing new game plus on higher difficulty. Thank you so much Bend studio for making this amazing game and releasing it on PC.

Days Gone (originally a PlayStation exclusive game) takes place in zombie-infested Oregon where player takes control of Deakon St. John, veteran and biker who drifts with his buddy Boozer on motorbike from one camp to the next, doing mercenary work and other jobs for surviving communities. Completing quests, killing the infected for bounties - that pretty much sums up the central gameplay loop. Quests and shooting stuff earn you cash, which can be used for new weapons or upgrading your motorbike. Experience gained can be used for upgrades in 3 different categories - melee, ranged and survival. You can also complete some random encounters, hunt animals for skin/meat, open new fast travel points (by restoring power to abandoned NERO checkpoints - buildings) and raid bandit camps.

This gamestyle reminds me so much of Horizon: Zero Down - of course in completely different world. Not sure, maybe it is also because it was a Playstation exclusive (didn't play any other PS exclusive games), but the game looks soooo similar, even the "weapon wheel", "survival senses" etc.

There is a story, but if I should describe it in one word, it would be "bland" or "inconsequential." In open-world games I am always an explorer...you can see me spend 50 hours just searching for hidden locations before actually progressing main storyline. Here, unfortunately, your curiosity dies quickly within few hours once you learn, that buildings are either completely empty (few materials here and there) or "magically" locked (end up being a location for a quest later in the game).

Combat is tough (Played and Hard II - 4th out of 6 difficulties - harder ones disable also HUD, which I didn't find ideal for my first walkthrough) right from the start and you can get killed by zombies in 2-3 hits. Also, fighting for example 3 wolves with melee weapon is practically impossible. On the other hand, Deakon seems bulletproof, because he can be shot many times by a sniper/shotgun without any issues. What I also like is, that ammo is scarce (at least in the beginning) and wasting bullets is not a good idea.

When launched on PS, the game had a lot of bugs and technical issues. Seems they managed to fix majority of those and throughout my gameplay, I encountered only one (but serious) issue, which is related to Save/Load. Hopefully this will be fixed during the launch (I am playing version for testing). Running the game on 10yrs old CPU+RAM (i7@4,8GHz, 16GB RAM) with 1070 Gaming GPU comfortably at mainly High Quality - I didn't encounter any performance issues.

My verdict? It is not a bad game, just...not great either. I was hyped originally, but the execution unfortunately didn't live up to my expectations...7/10

Days Gone

A Playstation exclusive worth waiting for, now to be played properly on PC. Game is optimized as hell for a console port. RX 5700XT with Ryzen 3800X, getting almost 100fps on Ultra.

Hope you give us Ratchet and Clank and Gran Turismo next, I'm certainly going to be occupied for a while with Days Gone. Thank god, been wanting a game to get into for a while.

Just buy it, 9/10, love to be in that world, ride my bike, have random fights. A shame they cancelled the sequel because of the critics that play 6 hours and then write their ''professional opinions'' just to make a click count. Listen to the players: played 20h+ >> 96% positive.

The below review was written after my first playthrough of the game, I chose the hard difficulty.

Days Gone is an outstanding game with flaws that ultimately do not ruin the experience. If I had to score it, I'd place it at an 8.5/10 overall. While I do think many of the criticisms of the game are fair, it seems like the overall score at the time of launch was dragged down by technical issues on the PS4 (which are largely not present on the PC version).
My criticisms of the game are largely levelled towards how aiming is handled, how difficulty is handled, the gasoline system, and certain encounters on the map.

Let's start from the top, the aiming mechanic does not work well unless you are running and gunning, but there are situations where this will get you absolutely destroyed. With the exception of a handful of weapons including the sniper rifles, the targeting reticle doesn't properly communicate where your first shot will land, this can and will lead to situations where a headshot will be lined up but your bullet hits the torso of an enemy, or misses entirely. When I started the game I assumed that the skill tree would address this, and my assumption was wrong. This didn't ruin combat, however it did leave the effectiveness of ranged stealth and dealing with human enemies -from cover- up to a coin toss with the majority of the primary weapons. The caveat here is that with quite a few of the late game weapons this is not the case, 9/10 times your first shot will be placed dead center of the reticle, even if that is not properly communicated to the player.

The difficulty modes can be pretty easily broken down, having played on hard I can say that anything below the first hard difficulty is probably too easy for anyone accustomed to shooters, and with the exception of the early game that same mode is not going to be much of a challenge for those people. My issue with the difficulty stems from how it essentially just cranks up the health of the enemies, specifically human enemies. I'm totally fine with seeing a zombie tank 10+ rounds to the stomach, however seeing an unarmored human opponent do the same is a little comical and at odds with the story. In the early game, everyone outside of a cutscene is capable of walking away with half of a magazine's worth of extra lead in their body. As you progress through the game and unlock weapons in a better condition this largely becomes a non-issue, however it absolutely does make quite a few of the early game encounters with human enemies feel cheap.

The gasoline system is where my single largest issue with the game lies, and it's unfortunate because there's the glimmer of a great idea in there. Ultimately it boils down to this: your motorcycle can only travel a few kilometers before you need to re-fuel. For anyone even remotely familiar with the average MPG of a motorcycle this is a joke. Without going into story spoiler territory there is an upgrade system that allows you to buy larger tanks, and there is a story reason for why your bike is hot garbage. Even with those reasons, they don't excuse just how much this system hinders gameplay. Fuel is extremely plentiful in this vision of the apocalypse, and stopping to fuel up every few minutes is just not fun. I think a much more impactful way to implement this system would have been to ratchet up the scarcity of fuel, and increase the range of the bike from the get-go, maybe not to realistic levels, but to a level that closely matches the mid-game upgrades. I ran out of gas one time through my almost 70 hour playthrough of the game. One time. What's even more frustrating is that it made for great gameplay. I ended up pushing my bike as far as I could, dodging enemies and searching for gasoline for about ten or fifteen minutes because I was way too far from any sort of safe zone, it was extremely tense and genuinely fun. It's a shame that the devs didn't commit to concept, instead making gas cans and working gas stations about as common as crafting components.

I'll keep the rest of this short, there are encounters on the map that feel plain cheap, no spoilers but they specifically deal with human enemies, and by the time you see them it's too late to dodge them. This is outright bad game design and every time I encountered this it felt like a cheap shot.

None of the things above outright ruin the experience, but they do stop it from going down as a masterpiece. Say what you will about the story and how it takes itself seriously, or how the tone of the game is outright bleak, but I think those elements only serve to heighten the experience. If you're even remotely interested in this game, you should probably pick it up.

Recommended with but some caveats.

Let me start by saying that this is a very good PC port.
Unlike Horizon Zero Dawn, which had a very rocky launch and was fixed by Guerilla Games months after release, Days Gone is solid from the get go: no performance issues, no crashes whatsoever.

That being said based on my experience, this is just an average game.
If you played the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy and State Of Decay then you know what to expect.
The shooting mechanics is very reminenescent to TR: the handling of the guns, how the shooting feels and also with the focus mode to highlight items and enemies, while the stealth mechanics and the scavenging system are very similar to State of Decay.
But hey, at least the studio borrowed from the right places.

What makes Days Gone stand out from other games is the strong narrative and the horde system as well as the gorgeous visuals.
The horde system in particular is pretty impressive considering the number of character models the game is able to coordinate without any dips in the performance.

Days Gone doesn't reinvent the wheel, nor did it aim too.
However due the repetitive nature of open world activities (eg: cookie cutter base destruction, material harvest for credit) are simply not enough to fill the idle time between missions, especially if you play on higher difficulties where fast travel is disabled.

PROS

- Interesting story
- Solid PC port with great K/M controls
- Great visuals
- Solid gameplay loop...

CONS

- ....which unfortunately gets repetitive pretty fast.
- Deacon (main protagonist) talks way too much and sometimes yells for no reason,while his conversation partner is half meter away (this can be noticed during the random encounters).
- The constant radio chatter gets annoying after a while, when other characters won't stop calling you.
- Audio overlaps: when you replay a recording and other characters call you via the radio you will hear multiple dialogues at once. This is particularly annoying when you consider that most recordings are just people screaming...

After beating the game on PS4, I had to see how it plays on PC. This is an amazing port. Sure, it needs maybe one patch to iron out the kinks. But overall this is a quality PC game. While Days gone may not be the best open world zombie shooter. It is full of frantic fights, survival elements, and a decent story. The graphics really shine on PC and if you have not had the pleasure of playing Days Gone, then this version the the way to go.

Actually a solid PC port and the story and gameplay are decent. Funny story, I was running into an issue in which at the end of almost every cutscene, my game would blackscreen and it would force me to tab out and back in to fix it. It turns out that the issue was on my end. I have a screensaver on a 60 second timer that is set to a black screen, and apparently this is the first game I've played on PC since implementing that screensaver that has cutscenes over 60 seconds long. Classic user error.

Game gud though.

Plenty of difficulty options for the seasoned.
Worth full price.

Sony brought another excellent game to PC after Horizon Zero Dawn.

Days Gone is a fantastic open world game set in Oregon after a viral outbreak that made most of the people zombie a.k.a. Freaks. The open world offers a lot to do. You can choose your playstyle, you can be stealthy with the crossbow or can run-and-gun. Story and voice acting are great, music and in-game songs are superb.

The first playtrough on normal difficulty took 56 hours doing everything, unlocking all weapons, second one on survival II difficulty took about 22 hours mostly focusing on the main story line.

In the end game you fight against hordes the size of which can vary 50-500 freaks. Careful planning is adviseable before engaging, because they kill you easily if ya dunno what you are doing.

Game's optimization is so good that words fail me, it runs smooth even on mid range pc. Many gamemaker should learn from Bend Studio in point of optimisation.

I am looking forward to play next Sony game ported to PC.

I bought this on PS4 two years ago and dropped about 20 minutes into it and got bored asap and forgot all about it. I picked it up on PC and now for some reason I'm borderline obsessed with it. I guess 4k / 60 fps has that effect when you're dealing with a game set in the Oregon woods (instead of the roughly 23 fps I'm guessing Days Gone PS4 was kicking out).

I wanted to blindly throw money at Sony in hopes of convincing them to release Bloodborne on PC too but ended up with a game that I had no clue was incredible this whole time. Some minor glitches involving quest dialogue and looping audio but the visual delivery of the game is incredible and at max everything on a 3080 this game hasn't dropped a single gotdamn frame from 60 fps.

If you've ever spent time in the northwestern woods, this game will make you wish you were there all over again.

Damn best pc port ever. Bring TLOU 1 on pc and you'll make me a happy man <3

Edit : after finishing the game 100% I'd give it a 8,5 out of 10 and hoping for a sequel. After DL1 it's the best open world zombie game out there no hesitation.

As I write this review for you, I am in the middle of an abandoned zombie-infested town about 20 hours into the game. Rain pitter-patters off log cabin and tin roofs as thunder roars overhead. It's sunset. I just used the fast travel feature to traverse several miles in a few seconds. As a result, my customized motorcycle is at 20% fuel. I'm on my way to another NERO checkpoint (basically a rundown governmental agent outpost), which will grant me a permanent Health, Stamina, or Focus (bullet time) upgrade if I can clear out the zombies and get the generators going so I can open the electrical doors.

I could just go into the encampment I'm partnered with nearby and pay its mechanic about $200 to refuel my bike. But I'm tired of paying everyone money for fuel. At another encampment, had I not spent so much money paying their mechanic for gas, I might've had enough cash to pay for a tire traction upgrade, but I was too poor.

So now I'm saving money by foraging a nearby abandoned town for a fuel can. I sneak up on a couple wandering zombies and stab them viciously in the side of the head, silently so as to not alert the rest of them. I searched two houses and gathered up some medical supplies before JACKPOT, a fuel canister sitting on the table. I bring it back to my bike, fill 'er up to 100%, and continue on my path toward the NERO checkpoint to permanently upgrade my character.

Listen, if you at all love the idea of post-apocalyptic zombie adventures, BUY THIS GAME. It's awesome.

I'm normally more of a multiplayer FPS guy, but I am a sucker for zombie media (The Walking Dead, Dawn of the Dead, etc.), and this game captures the atmosphere of the best zombie flicks perfectly, all while maintaining an extremely solid set of gameplay mechanics and an engaging storyline.

Nevermind the set of bonus challenges which are fun in and of themselves and grant rewards that apply to your character and his bike in the campaign. Nevermind the well-optimized and GORGEOUS graphics. Nevermind the engaging and fun physics of the dirtbike or the intelligent AI which can create massive hordes of 300+ zombies at a time. Nevermind the multiple difficulties or the New Game +.

This is possibly the best zombie game ever created.

This game is quite the journey, it has alot of red dead 2 and last of us vibes. its length is pretty long from what it seems aswell im only 38 hours in and there's still more story missions to do. With newgame+ and plenty of upgrades/unlocks the replayability is something to look into aswell totally worth 50 bucks.

The game and storyline is seriously good - better than any novel or movie, and with more bang for your buck. I have to say, I got so into it that I may have a little bit of PTSD. It has intense dives into sociopathy, psychopathy, and the step by step process that brings you to those places. I urge caution playing this game for people who have weak constitutions or who aren't hardened by life. This game really earns it's M rating, and can have temporary effects on your mental health if you get dug in and play it for days without break like I did.

I'm heartbroken there won't be a sequel.

Days Gone is an excellent open world, action adventure game. It's incredible cinematics and lovely story had me intrigued from start to finish. With enemy and mission variety spread throughout that made me eager to find out what the game was going to throw at me next. It's gunplay is unfortunately subpar putting a minor damper on what is overall a solid package but, considering that this could've been just another generic map-marker driven experience, Bend Studio created a game that stands stronger than most that fall into the same category.

Don't listen to the major publications on this one. If you have even the slightest interest, pick it up. I don't think you'll regret it.

Pros:
- Amazing story, with great and exciting event, and memorable moments and characters.
- Gameplay Mechanics are fun and satisfying.
- Graphics look pretty, better than PS4.
- You'll find yourself getting attached to the main characters.
Cons:
- Camp optional missions sometimes feel repetitive.
- The grinding system is not balanced, (for example: on the first half of the game you'll feel that your character is way too weak, especially when it comes to fighting Hordes, so you'll find yourself running away from them and keeping them to a later time of the game, also the upgrades of the bike feel a little bit useless or they have a very small effect on the performance of the bike.
- The icons of object can sometimes feel a little confusing.
- The optional activities aren't encouraging to do, because the rewards aren't worth it that much.
- Looting buildings and cars can get boring because you'll only find some limited crafting materials or some ammo and that's it.

Overall Review: 8.5/10,
it was a fun experience even though it had some noticeable negative aspects.

Outstanding game. I did not expect it to be as good as it was; it starts off slow and disjointed (this is the single part of the game that could have done better... think about that). In that way it's similar to Red Dead Redemption 2 which also started slow and was overall a slow burn. Get past that first hour or two, your in for a sweet ride.

The Walking Dead was awesome for a season or two; it was about the zombies; then it became about people so it became every other drama with zombies in the background. The writers of this game should have been writing The Walking Dead, it would have been awesome past a couple seasons, it's nearly always about the zombies. Taking on a horde is one of the very few gaming experiences that was legitimately awesome. Every time you take on a zombie horde it is tense, stressful, panic-inducing and incredibly rewarding when you stave them off and defeat them.

My only gripe is I honestly think the game should have ended in a tragedy, it would have nailed it if it had, I get a good ending is nearly always the way to end a thing but damn if a zombie apocalypse shouldn't end in a tragedy, that would be gold.

Solid game, up there with Red Dead Redemption 2, Horizon Zero Dawn and Death Stranding; easily the hallmark of gaming in the past few years, period.

I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Days Gone. It's not a perfect game: I did not care for the quest interface (which often had me confused about what to do) and some of the walking cutscenes were dreadfully slow. But overall, this is a great game with likeable characters, a decent story about friendship and love, fluid and tense action, fun bike mechanics and a wealth of content to expore. Check it out if you like open world games, zombies and driving around on a bad-ass bike! 8/10

This game threw me for a loop! The first few hours were all tutorial and not showing alot of depth to this game. Soon after it pushes you off the cliff and there's no going back. Completed the entire game and cannot for the life of me understand how a work of art like this doesn't get the opportunity to add a DLC or even a second version. Hopefully the PC community embraces it as I have and breathes new life into the idea. Thanks Bend Studios!!!

Haven't had much time to play it yet, but for the 3 hours I've gotten to play it's been nothing short of amazing. I think the only con I really have is finding gas every 5 minutes but it isn't much of an issue. Worth the full price buy for me.

This game feels extremely organic in its atmosphare, objectives and missions. Animations also flow really really well. Each combat encounter had me be creative because I can't just peak and pop like most other cover based combat games due to the scarce ammo the game has. Zombies feel like a real threat. It is a bit repeatitive but I fell that is not because lack of varriety but more so because the game can't decide which parts to repeat well, making some more frequent than others. I played the game on hard, and thats what I recommend too. I don't really know what changes between the difficulties but if its fuel and ammo, then I felt that hard was the pretty nice balance. That's said, play on whatever you feel comfortable.

That being said, I think it would be fair to say that it is a pretty standard openworld aside from the whole biker stuff. Felt a lot life far cry to me.

The game doesn't do a whole lot, but what it does it does pretty decently. Riding, and fighting all feel nice. Story is some what interesting, more because of characters charm than plot but its nice stiil. I totally recommend it. It's pretty solid.

Days Gone feels like the apocalyptic sequel to the GTA 4 standalone expansion The Lost and Damned, except instead of an arsenal of bikes, you only have one and you gotta take good care of it. You ride around an open world trying to be fuel efficient, switching between story missions and clearing out some camps, Far Cry style.

One thing this game does better than most other open world games, is to not bombard you with 100 question marks on the map when you open it. There will be 1-3 objectives at any point, which makes the game feel much less of a map clearing chore than most other open world games. You can go where you please, but the limited missions at any time will give players largely the same route to follow.

Melee weapons need maintenance, and guns have limited ammo. This can make for some tense moments, especially early on when you are scavenging a lot, having to decide if an engagement is even worth it or if you should sneak past or run away. Days Gone manages to put some atmospheric horror in the open world this way, which reminds me of Stalker.

The port is incredible, the best i've experienced so far. Looks great and runs buttery smooth.

First impressions from the intoductory two hours - flawless PC version and great game.
Edit after finishing the game - first impressions were correct. PC version is flawless and DG is a great game, even if it can't quite compete with the best of the open world genre (such as RDR2, Kingdom Come or Witcher 3). There is a bit too much copy/pasted design as well as some questionable narrative beats. But the strong points - great gameplay and gunplay, fights against hordes, beautifully realized Oregon - mean that I enjoyed it throughout.
8/10

Honestly one of the best plays I have had in a very long time! I was reluctant at first because of the poor reviews it got when it was first release on the PS, but this game was meant for the PC as most of the issues with the original reviews were about technical issues which are pretty much non-existent on the PC.

Great story, great graphics, great controls and great HORDES!!!!

And with the sale price right now you would be foolish to still not have bought this game! Even at full price you wouldn't regret buying this game!

This game is absolutely amazing. And I mean in way more ways than just the graphics and performance - which are literally the best I have ever seen! But the gameplay is so cool. If you have been searching high and low for a zombie survival game that's actually really good, played Dayz (love it) and State of Decay and all the current ones. Well this game actually felt like I have finally found the right game for me.

I have no idea why so many reviewers from PS4 release to now call this game mediocre or just "alright" its literally a masterpiece and you would be mad not to try it, even just for the 2 hour refund window, again people in reviews saying it starts slow. It literally starts in such an epic manner and the story gripped me from the get go. Also the gameplay right from the get go is exciting and just what I want from a zombie survival game.

Also note I started my playthrough on survival 1 difficulty and I feel like that is the best balance for immersion and difficulty.

The game reminds me of a combination of other open-world games. Red Dead Redemption, just for the feel of riding on your bike through the north american wildernis in all it's glory. You encounter (undead) wild-life and gather plants for crafting and food. The Last of Us (not open world I know) but it clearly was made in the same style, from crafting, gunslinging, melee-combat, stealth, story and characters... Assassins Creed/FarCry, where you encounter enemy strongholds/bases to clear for extra benefits for your character.
So if you enjoy those types of games, Days Gone is something you'd enjoy too.

There is a minor repetitiveness to the game, but it does not feel like grinding, just gameplay mechanics (it's game after all). The graphics are fantastic and realistic. The world really feels lived in, and the locations you scout out and houses you enter feel like somebody once lived there and left in a hury, and that people have looted afterwards, leaving you only scrap and the like. There's a realistic day-night cycle with weather ranging from summer-sunshine to rain comon to north western america, and snow that again is very well done, certainly on higher graphic settings.

Apart from leveling up your character, you'd be doing the same for your trusted companion, your bike. Which is the main means of travel, while it consumes fuel and gets damaged over time or due to attack, gets you from your quest-hub to wherever it is you need to be. And as jobs can come from all over the map, you'd want to take good care of your bike and upgrade it as soon as upgrades become available.

Gunplay, although your main means of attack, is a bit on the background and therefore guns are realistic, with gun sway and in case of the crossbow gravity that are being employed for realism. Ammo is scarce and you soon learn not to spray your targets but gently aim and do headshots.

The story is in the same style as The Last of Us on the Playstation (this is a PS port). You have flawed characters trying to survive in a zombie infested world. Flimsy alliances are build and destroyed by distrust and typical human backstabbing. Your main story line lets you travel throughout the large-ish map and you encounter the typical survivor groups you might expect in Zombieland America. From preppers to local gangs who've taken over camps, to drifters, militia-men and gun-nut rednecks, to wacky religious type zealots who embrace the end of the world. The characters are all very well voice-acted and motion-captured and you genuinly feel like you're part of the story.

I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes story-driven, open-world action adventures. Deek out!

I went into Days Gone expecting to not enjoy myself because it had the reputation for being a mediocre (at best) flop from the PS4 several years ago.

Boy was I surprised.

I really enjoyed Days Gone. (Slight bias from being a biker myself?) The game isn't without a few minor issues but the open world is certainly more enjoyable and tolerable to traverse than say, Horizon Zero Dawn. It hits the expected "post apocalyptic zombie" story beats but the game never gets boring as you go. It's especially interesting as you're doing whatever your mission or objective is that you eventually become hyper aware that the small group of zombies or humans you've encountered might draw a larger horde out if you're too loud, which is another interesting game element.

Eventually though you do become very overpowered near the end of the game which helps cleaning up optional objectives such as hordes and camps, etc but for most of the game you feel just about where you should be for a power level. Near the start things are tough, most of the game will be "just right" for what you're doing......until you accidentally stumble upon a horde, etc

The PC version also added many PC improvements including higher quality textures and effects, frame rate, FOV and unltrawide support (if you're 1 of the 12 people with an ultrawide monitor). I played on version 1.0 and with the first patch as well and encountered no issues at all (AMD 5900X + RTX3090) and maintained 1440p/120fps the entire time, but it is important to note that many people have reported various problems from the game not booting to stuttering and performance issues in the days of release.

Played the story to completion and cleared up many of the additional sidequest stories. Recommended.

While I'm not a huge fan of many Sony 1st party games, this was definitely a pleasant surprise. It also gives me hope that I'll see the 2 or 3 other Sony games I enjoy make their way to PC where they will look and play best since Sony have announced a whole slate are coming. The Last Of Us Remastered and Shadow Of The Colossus Remake!

I don't care to go on and on when everyone else already is, just buy the damn game and play it all the way through, or replay it. Solid 10/10 in my book.

I was reluctant to buy this but at $40 I took the chance after reading reviews. Wow, what a ride, what a story.
More current end of the world as we know it. Many different factions for you to choose to support based on how they operate. The story line is awesome and unpredictable. Side challenges naturally but the thread is pushing toward a final conclusion. I think this might be a friends multiplayer option for me if there are no hackers in it. Having fun. That's the objective right? Get it, you won't be disappointed. Graphics awesome. Characters awesome.

Days Gone is more than a game... it’s an experience. Not only my favourite Sony/Playstation release, but probably my favourite game of all time. From the smooth and satisfying bike animations to the incredible storyline and character development throughout, everything about this game is beautifully created, especially the world itself! I bought this game when it first released on PS4 in 2019 and played it everday until I had done everything I could and recieved the platinum trophy. I’ve now bought it again and am playing through it, still enjoying every second of my time in the world Bend Studio have developed. It’s very sad that we may not see a Days Gone 2 but I still have hope... one day.

DAYS GONE is an extremely under-rated masterpiece that I haven't felt with another story driven + open world game in a very long time.

PROS
Main Character Deacon St. John is the most expressive, emotional, compassionate, fleshed out character I have ever seen in a story game. He has some wild facial expressions that really show his emotion, he has random adrenaline voice lines when in fire fights that really emphasizes how stressed he is, the way he reacts about the unknown whereabouts of his wife Sarah and how he talks at her grave is very tragic and saddening. As a character he really does bring emotional experience to YOU the player.
Cutscenes in Days Gone are very beautiful in background, color, and especially nice in character mouth movements and facial expression. Never experienced a game that made mouth movements and facial expressions as expressive as this game. Genuinely adds a movie type depth to the game.
Genuinely lots of tasks to do to 100% the base game, as well as a fair amount of different weapons you can use to defeat enemies in the open world
Liked that there are MANY different types of enemies not just zombies and their mutated counter parts.
Off of the last point... not many Zombie games focus on the people in the apocalypse, and more so on blind Zombie killing. Days Gone however focuses more on how people became more barbaric and blood thirsty for resources, people, guns, etc. I like that the main focus of most of the game are specific enemy groups or friendly camps and how Deacon will overcome their presence and own set of issues.
Runs extremely well for a PS4 game port... Very smooth with no issues on quality at max settings
Riding the bike feels genuinely fun and I don't really understand why...

CONS
Like every other open world story game, there is only SO much different type of game-play and objectives you can accomplish before the game becomes bloated. Days Gone does not become bloated thankfully, but it is indeed a bit tedious for collectible hunting as well as some repetitive elements in how you accomplish your tasks. In my opinion I think the rewards justified it, others may not see it that way.
Reputation for friendly camps either felt extremely easy to accomplish or like a dumb grind which locks certain bike/gun/crafting upgrades if you didn't level them. Felt annoying to do tiny open world side quests which were RNG to try to gain just a little bit of reputation...
Melee weapons feel too weak mainly because groups of Zombies in harder game difficulties just destroyed you. Guns felt extremely strong with just one hit headshots. Combine that with PC mouse aim and you can take down a ton of zombies very fast.
There are some weird glitches with dead corpses sometimes. Probably weird physics problems from porting the game. Some enemies fly into the air or clip through the ground when they die. Its more or less harmless to gameplay, and more funny in my opinion.

IS IT WORTH $50?
Honestly... yes. The game feels insanely different than any other open world story game I have ever played, and I have grown to love the story, characters, and world building that surrounds the entirety of Days Gone .

Cliche story for sure, but, the gameplay loop for me was addicting. The guns and melee combat are fun, the bike feels nice to drive, the sneaking is good, and there are some really nice outfit mods to download for Deacon

Daryl Simulator


TL;DR

Successful port of an underestimated PS4 exclusive


The game in a nutshell

Days Gone is an Open World 3rd Person Action-Adventure game with Survival elements that plays in a post-apocalyptic Oregon. A virus turned most of the population into zom... uhm freakers as you follow Deacon St. John, a Biker who would come to life if Daryl from "The Walking Dead" and Joel from "The Last Of Us" had a baby boy - a taciturn badass misanthrope who literally hates the f***** up world he is forced to live in but with a heart of gold hidden behind pain. As you progress the story line you´ll encounter the ususal suspects: several fractions with unique side quests and rewards, a ton of freakers led by swarm intelligence, marauders and a dubious organization called Nero in an internally and externally destroyed world.

+/-

+

- beautifully designed Open World with a dynamic day/night and weather cycle system
- ...that is not overloaded with 2k map markers that feel like a chore
- dynamic weather affects terrain and freakers as they´re stronger by night and in wet/cold conditions
- believable and well written main character
- fantastic music score and sound effects
- upgrade and personalize your bike (yeah)
- 3 skill trees
- a feeling of constant fear and threat that never leaves you
- horde fights with up to several hundreds of freakers
- ...that will rip you to pieces if you´re not prepared properly
- survival aspect by collecting ingredients for bandages, molotovs etc. you can´t buy anywhere
- ...so you´re forced to loot and collect constantly
- well designed photo mode

-

- occasional frame drops and stuttering
- minor bugs
- ...but a restart usually fixes it
- the initially potentially exciting story is lost in mediocrity
- less is more - prioritizing individual aspects would´ve given the game sharper contours
- ...e.g. most stealth missions are copied, plain boring and feel added unnecessarily to increase mission variety
- your bike needs more booze than Tom Waits in his worst times
- ...but to be fair you´ll find plenty of it
- the points mentioned are, however, complaints at a high level - the game is great and the port well done


Summary

Although DG doesn´t reinvent the wheel it definitely is one of the best zombie games I´ve played. The beautifully designed world, the scruffy characters and first of all the atmosphere is where it shines! There is this certain feeling of fear and constant threat that sucks me in deeply. Everything in this world is hostile and if there were squirrels they´d throw steaming feces at you. I also deeply appreciate the mature narrative instead of the usual "and then they all lived happily ever after" unicorn crap as the world is what it is: overrun by evolving abominations and survivors are constantly fighting for their sheer existence in a brutal, destroyed and degenerated world - and yet there is a bitter-sweet glimpse of hope to keep them more or less alive. And finally you´ll get to play a Daryl type character who perfectly fits into this scenery. All in all I highly recommend Days Gone - it is exactly what the doctor prescribed for a patient like me.

Biker Zombie Far Cry. This very much sums it up. Storytelling clearly beats Far Cry 5 (But that's also true for Tetris).

But seriously, beyond the ususal Open World side mission fillers, AND with a few mods reducing the looting/crafting busywork (durabilty, crafting costs), it's storytelling and the rest is quite good. Or is it?
because:


Thumbs up comes with some heavy qualifiers:
Recommend blocking it in a firewall. Or not buying it if you can't. It is a massive and shameless data grabber. Even with "limited data" Sony in a SP game beats even MP Anti cheat Spyware like EAC or battleeye in privacy violation.


Shameless data grabbing (in a SP game)

Other issues, despite being out a while now: it absolutely nails the graphics card to the wall (or roof)! It just runs constantly at 100% gpu. Even in the menu. Although that gives you a live preview of FPS and gpu use when changing graphics parameters, which is neat.

By limiting it to 60fps i got it down to kinda normal levels. Also Lighting quality high-> very high is a killer!
Game also doesn't recognise HDR display. All others do.

There are also a few minor (quest)bugs that exist for ages. And a big one that stops you from collection zombie trophies to sell. Making kiling the impressive hordes utterly pointless.

For your Far Cry itch try Horizon Zero Dawn instead if you haven't yet. It's the (better) Robo-dino Far Cry.

Runs great, looks great, absolutely one of the best console ports to come out recently (even without a day one patch). The controller configuration needs you to bind the joysticks to both steer your bike and use the crafting/survival wheel, and KBM support is there (though it needs some refinement).

The story itself, suffers from "slow burn" in the initial hour or so, but then it opens up, pacing shifts, and provides great motivation to explore certain mysteries, flesh out the lore of "what happened", as well as make you care about characters in the game. This is one of those games that starts bleak and dull, then by the time it ends, it does so with a brilliant flourish that is all but assured to leave you wanting more.

The world at the end stretches out before you and practically begs you to explore it, tie up loose ends, formulate new high risk strategies to take down monstrous hordes, and reap the massive rewards for your hard effort. I definitely wanted a sequel when I played it on PS4 Pro, and I very much still want it on PC.

Visuals 9/10
Setting 8/10
Sound 9/10
Stability 8/10
Performance 9/10
Fun 8/10 (after the first hour)

Overall 8.5 out of 10 (A definitive gaming experience worth having)

P.S.
The game IS open world and you are free to roam about it as you choose. The main missions are scripted like literally every other open world game, and the method of progression in a mission is to guide you from one point of it to the next until that mission is complete. The beginning missions are meant to be an orientation without holding your hand, yet offering scripted guidance to a certain point before finally letting you loose on the expansive world in Days Gone.

I've been attempting to explore the entirety of the world and find the hidden locations, lore, and good loot spots since the beginning, when not in mission. Yes the main character is a brooding biker dealing with tragedy, loss, being constantly beaten over the head with joining a faction, meanwhile dealing with a lack of closure other emotional crises, and the Apocalypse itself.
