It's rare to see this much polish (on a console to PC port) right out of the gate. Sony has really put a lot of time and effort into making sure that this game was ready for release. It is even equipped with DLSS and FSR right "out of the box", which really shows that Sony are treating PC gamers to a level of optimisation rarely seen from other developers (cough Rockstar). Jumping into Ultra settings gets you the visual upgrade you would expect to see on PC over console. While the story and controls are as solid and intuitive (respectively) as they were on console. This is really the best version of the game available, and I look forward to seeing more Playstation titles being ported to PC by Sony. If this is the bar, they set it high!

No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be.

SONY, DO YOU LIKE MONEY?

GoW has been in the top spots of the top sellers for over a week, with an overwhelmingly positive score and just like Horizon, it is a great game.

Keep porting your games to PC. Give us more.

GIVE. US. MORE.

No extra launcher? No signing into a Bethesda account in order to play? No exclusivity for a year on the Epic store? It's almost like Sony delivered us exactly what we wanted. Absolutely loving it and kudos to the publisher and developer for giving us this formerly console exclusive.

Download, Play. No launchers, no in-game accounts. Straight into the actions, the way a game is suppose to be. This game was amazing for me on ps4 with 30FPS and lesser graphics. Now it's simply mind blowing.

Playing a PlayStation exclusive on PC using a Xbox controller feels nice.
Also it's God of war. What else do you need?

Hey Sony! I heard you like money? Well, I got some. Let's make a deal; You give us Spiderman, Miles Morales, TLOU 1/2, Ghost of Tsushima next and you can have my money. What do you say?

Edit: A lot of people got mad that I didn't bloodborne to the list, so here it is.

Absolutely amazing port! I already played this game on PS4 back then, so i know what to expect, so this was more of a review of the PC port. I have a high end PC, and was worried it would still be rough, but i am easily running this at 1440p Ultra 90fps+.

As for the game, the story is incredible, world is gorgeous, characters are very well done along with their voice acting. The combat is intense, and brutal. The music is incredible as well. This game is a masterpiece, that should be played by everyone. Use DLSS if you need better fps, cause they did a good job supporting that.

It is hard to explain the emotions you go through when you experience this game. I'm in early 40s and i have played a lot of games during my life. Only few games I considered memorable, generational games that defined what an amazing game is and God of War goes beyond this.

God of War, for the lack of a better word, is a masterpiece. It is subjectively the best game made I have ever played in my life. An emotional epic that not only delivers Oscar worthy story and performances from actors but game mechanics and presentation that are brutal, satisfying and fluid. Not only it looks unbelievable and cinematic in it's the scope and engaging gameplay, it pays homage to everything that came before it in the series.

I have played ALL previous God of War games including mobile releases and the emotions you feel playing this game having experienced the whole backstory in previous games and Kratos' history is incomparable to anything else. But even if you haven't, you will not feel left out.

Again, a masterpiece of modern storytelling and game development. Do not miss this game, it redefines what a truly epic game is.

♥♥♥♥ this game, The price on Steam says that the game is only $49.99 but that's a lie, it's going to cost me over $600 total because I'm literally forced to buy a PS5 and God of War Ragnarok now.

I haven't wrote a single review in the 11 years of owning steam.
The reason I'm doing so now is because I felt like expressing my gratitude for this masterpiece.

The past few years with lockdowns and all that I had a lot of free time for gaming but I just couldn't enjoy the games the same way I used to before covid. I just got bored of them so quick and it felt like the repetitive same old same old that lots of AAA games have nowadays.

I heard so many good stories about God of War that I had high expectations when I first bought it, and I'm so happy I did.
This game exceeds all expectations in every single way imaginable.

The character development of every individual you encounter is unique in its own way, the way the world is build is absolutely breathtaking and its amazing to just explore all the little things hidden away. Its so immersive and you really get to feel for Kratos and his son. Every time you start up this game you're in for a new adventure, not one time have I felt like something I was doing seemed familiar. Its much more than just a hack-and-slash game, the fighting mechanics are really well thought through and feel really smooth, the graphics are absolutely amazing. I can easily say that God Of War is on my Top 3 best games ever played.

11/10 MUST BUY

PC Specific:

Performance: Outstanding. This is probably the first AAA game in years that manages to release in an almost perfect state when it comes to optimization. So far no crashes, hitting full 144fps at 1440p without a single dip that i noticed, this just feels absolutely great to play. (will update if this changes while progressing through the game)

Controls: M/KB works fine so does an xbox controller, think for this one i'll stick with the latter (rare for me) simply because thats how i played the main trilogy as well.

Visuals: Outstanding again. I've seen the entire game at release and compared to how crisp the game looks now, 3/4 years later on PC it absolutely looks like a game that would release in 2022. You can Disable annoyances (i.e motion blur) and with HDR enabled, the lighting/shadows and color palette look absolutely stunning, seriously turn it on for this one even on lower luminance screens this will look fantastic.

The Game itself: Just buy it, i don't think i can add anything that hasn't been said about this masterpiece before. This is simply put a must own even if its just for the incredible acting performances of pretty much everyone involved.

- DIFFICULTY -

🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it
🔲 Easy
☑️ Normal
☑️ Hard (Challenge mode)
☑️ "Dark Souls" (Give Me "God of War" mode)

Okay, this will be controversial. The game expects you to be alert and quick in your reflexes and make full use of the range of combat mechanics in the harder levels and the punishment curve, at least in my own personal opinion, is quite steep.

- GRAPHICS -

🔲 "MS Paint"
🔲 Bad
🔲 Meh
🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game
🔲 Good
🔲 Beautiful
☑️ Masterpiece

- MUSIC -

🔲 Bad
🔲 Not special
🔲 Good
☑️ Beautiful

Bear McCreary has worked his magic in creating a score that fits the baritone of Kratos' voice and the atmosphere of pain, perseverance and grit quite appropriately. There are gentler sections when need be, and fast strings and chanting vocals accompanied by brass during the more epic boss fights. It's great and totally immersive.

- STORY -

🔲 This game has no story
🔲 Like playing "Temple Runners" for the story
🔲 It's there for the people who want it
🔲 Well written
☑️ Epic story

Santa Monica Studios have always been known for telling a really gripping story throughout the history of this franchise, and this GoW is no exception, grabbing the attention of the players right from the get-go. The game does expect you to do the basic homework regarding the background of Kratos though, and once that is taken care of, the story has no lack of gravitas and nostalgia, coupled with frequent stunning set-pieces and consistent pacing.

- PRICE -

🔲 Underpriced
🔲 Perfect price
☑️ Could be cheaper
🔲 Overpriced
🔲 Complete waste of money

Sony could have released it a bit lesser than 2018 pricing, mere $10 rebate in 4 years seems a bit steep. Yet as far as substance is concerned, the game strongly holds its value and is still a valid purchase.

- REQUIREMENTS -

🔲 You can run it on a microwave
☑️ Average
☑️ High end
🔲 "NASA" computer

The PC port is near flawless, and the early frame drops in wider areas and stuttering that I have encountered have all been (or being) patched actively. Due to the presence of custom frame rate capping and support for Fidelity FX and NVIDIA DLSS, it does not take the cutting edge modern system to get a decent experience. That said, Current or one generation old hardware can really portray the beauty of the colour palette and fluidity in the combat the to the fullest.

Just for context, I am using a Ryzen 5600X, 16GB 3200Mhz memory and a 3070Ti FE GPU and it has been buttery.

- LENGTH -

🔲 Very short (0 - 3 hours)
🔲 Short (3 - 15 hours)
☑️ Average (15 - 50 hours)
☑️ Long (50 - 90 hours) (for completionist runs)
🔲 Extremely long (90 - 110 hours)
🔲 No Ending (you can literally get lost in the map and not do any quests and still have loads of fun)

The PC playthrough is my third, the two prior being the basic one and then getting my rear smacked in "Give Me God of War" difficulty in New Game+. This run would have its focus on completing everything (main+side quests, optional bosses) in a single playthrough and by my experience, 90 hours should suffice.

- FUN -

🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry
🔲 Hard to enjoy
🔲 Repetitive
🔲 Actually pretty amusing
☑️ Ride of your life

Overwhelmingly fun game. That's it. That's the description.

- REPLAYABILITY -

🔲 It's a one - time experience
🔲 Only for achievements
🔲 If you wait a few months / years
☑️ Definitely
🔲 Infinitely replayable

The game has some sections that you would need to revisit (not having the right gear to unlock hidden regions) and there are higher difficulty levels to explore in future runs (the game recommends to save the hardest till at least the completion of a single run) and then there's New Game+ where you start with all accumulated gear and skills from prior runs. That said, it's a minor disappointment that although New Game+ has fresh sets of armour, it does not introduce fancier ways to take the enemies down.

- WORTH BUYING -

🔲 No
🔲 Wait for sale
☑️ Yes

I’m going to be real here. This is the greatest game I’ve ever played. There is not a single thing I disliked. It’s been years since I played a game that kept me that invested into a story, into its characters and world. It’s beautiful. And with tears streaming down my face I’m ready to pick up the leviathan and head out with Atreus to explore this gorgeous world to its fullest. I still have many bosses to do battle with and some more mythology to uncover.I’m so happy to have had experienced it.

Absolute masterpiece.

It's rather sad to see so many Triple-A game companies over the last decade focus on repetitive gameplay and constant microtransactions - their focus being to keep you paying and playing their game over and over again.
Gaming was supposed to be 'a movie where you have the control' but that concept has been lost in time, due to greed.

Not God of war...

God of War is 5 year old console game, that was released on Playstation, and then re-ported to PC - and their PC port stands up better than most other AAA titles that have been released. It didn't crash once, neither did I have any fps drops throughout my journey. I was surprised by how stable the port was.

The game comes with a mechanically sound and fairly satisfying combat system. If you know the trilogy you will be happy to know the fighting is very much the same - to a degree. Hack and slash, but remember - there is a boy travelling with Kratos now, so the extreme and brutal god that Kratos used to be, is repressed by the fact he now has to fight along side his son. But that allows for an exciting new set of fighting mechanics. Kratos being the front line power house and Arteus the back line archer.
This mixture makes for a very interesting battle mechanic.

Kratos, the fearsome ex Greek god who once wore the mantle of God of War, has escaped his violent past to Midgard. The earth of Norse legends. There, he starts a family and lives a quiet life in the woods. But Midgard has its own pantheon of gods, with their own agendas. The presence of a foreign god in their land can't stay unnoticed for long and the past Kratos is trying to forget is but one unfortunate encounter away.

An interesting world based on Norse myth, full of lore to discover and things to learn. Perhaps most importantly, some absolutely beautiful vistas and many wonderfully fantastical locales to discover. The game does allow you to visit several realms, so there is a fair amount of variety. The world is further enhanced by the obviously high production values. The graphics and music is absolutely breathtaking and fitting - I was left standing around on occasions just admiring the view.

All in all, this was a wonderful worthwhile experience. We certainly need more high-budget, quality single-player games on the platform. Particularly those lacking loot boxes and other such monetisation nonsense. I certainly recommend it to all fans of single-player action-adventures, as well as Greek and Norse myth.

As someone very wise said; I will continue to buy Playstation games on Steam until they release Bloodborne for PC (and FFVII Remake without the exclusivity of Epic games).

Update: Looking at the comments I need to also request at the same level of quality, Spider Man, Bloodborne, Demon Souls, FFVIIR (fixed please), Last of Us, Ratchet and Clank, and of course in the future, Ragnarok!!!!!

I personally think its the current best game of 2022 and one of my favorite games :)
Goods:
- No launchers or ingame account
- Good Gameplay with interesting fights
- Playable with controller
- Interesting Story
Bads:
- Still has some bugs since it's a new game
- No additional content since the game on ps4
Hope they'll port another games from ps4 and ps5 to PC such as Spiderman, Bloodborne and more.
It would be amazing :)

It's God of War, but on PC. Haven't run into any of the usual port issues, it's just smooth as butter. Played in on PS4 way back when it came out, and I'm enjoying the better graphics and frames now. Play this game. Support this game. Ports coming out in working condition should be rewarded, which is a ridiculous thing to say I know, but right now in gaming, it's what needs doing.

EPIC!
This game is great. I remember the old days when I used to play God of War in my PS2, they were really great and now we have the option to play GOW on PC oh my goodness. Sony bringing their games to pc... It's like a dream, you get to play Kratos once more but this time on another world.

The combat feels good, and the variation and attacks are really great while you enjoy the story it offers, and let's no forget new game +, wich I'm playing btw, it really is a good game which has replayability.

The map is gorgeous and it has plenty to explore, level up and improve weapons and that's not everything, you get a detailed story about Norse mythology and meet different characters and gods.

Buy this game if you like action games, but don't be like me who played it on highest difficulty, play normal or even Hard but remember to explore the game.

Have Fun! :)

I'm a person who finds it really difficult to get into a new game these days, and this game connected me from the beginning. As far as the game is concerned, it has managed to capture my heart with different but similar region designs, music, gameplay and a world that constantly pushes us to look for and explore something, unfortunately we can't find a better one these times. I hope that God of War: Ragnarok will come to the PC and I can continue the story where I left off.

One of the best games i've played of the last decade. A game that saved a series and a studio and won game of the year in the stacked year of 2018, are just a few of it's many achievements.

From the brutal and visceral combat. To the beautiful graphics and art design. and of course it's incredible story. GOD OF WAR is the full package that is worth every penny imo.

But how is it as a PC port? a bit of a mixed bag at least for me and a few others I know, but it is by no means a bad port, far from it. It has a good range of options to alter. And also supports DLSS. My personal issue and that i've heard from a few others too is that the FPS can jump pretty drastically. You can be at a Smooth 120 FPS and drop to 80-90 without even moving or doing anything intensive and these drops happen frequently.

But overall this is an amazing game and worth a play for anyone new to the series or veterans alike.

maybe I'm late playing this game, but this is one of the best stories I have ever seen in a game, it drags you in for every twist and turn. The voice acting is out of this world, you can feel the emotion as Kratos grows as a person and as a father throughout the game.

On the gameplay side the combat is brilliantly designed to not become boring and is easily tailored to your preference. One of the very best gaming experiences i have had in a long time.

Introduction
With Sony finally bringing their IPs to PC, a God of War (GoW) game is playable for the first time on PC. This is the first GoW game that I have played, however, this one does not require you to have played the previous games in order to understand the story. This game will feature gods from Norse Mythology and it’s rich with it. This makes the feeling of being in the world really fitting, something that I myself like.

Pros and Cons
Pros
The story is really well done, with lots of lore scattered around
Fun and very interesting characters with their own personalities
Combat is engaging, with interesting upgrades to utilize
Awesome boss battles that are really fun
Many secrets to acquire to upgrade your health, rage, weapons, or armor
Amazing graphics that are very nice to look at

Cons
Alfheim felt a little slow when I first arrived in the area
Kratos will only use his fists during Spartan Rage and won’t use any of his weapons

Story
Many years have passed since Kratos took his revenge on the Olympian gods and him having survived the final battle with Zeus. Kratos has since traveled to Midgard in Ancient Norway, where he now lives with his son Atreus. They are both mourning the passing of Faye, Kratos second wife, and her final request was for her ashes to be spread from the highest peak of the Nine Realms. Joseph Seed from Far Cry 5, who is a mysterious stranger in this game, attacks Kratos at his home and apparently cannot feel any sort of pain. After the fight, Kratos takes Atreus and heads out on an adventure, where he will teach his son how to survive a harsh world.

A nice view 
A Screenshot of God of War
By: ∞Tyknighter: 99 Red Balloons

The story for God of War is really good and I honestly think it’s one of the best stories that I have witnessed in gaming. The characters are all brimming with personalities that make them unique and special. My favorite character has to be Mimir, he is funny, has lots of knowledge and wisdom, while being a travel comparing.

I also like Sindri and Brok, who are both dwarfs, as they help upgrade weapons and much more, because they are blacksmiths. Sindri is an extreme germaphobe and I can kind of somewhat relate to him. I mean, I am not putting my hands in a dragon's mouth to grab a tooth. Brok, who is my favorite out of the two brothers, is a hothead who has a very serious-like attitude, with a great voice.

There are other supporting characters that are really good too with their own unique personalities that are honestly worth talking about. However, that would make this review longer than it should be.

There is also a ton of lore out there for you to collect and find, each will give you some backstories of some characters or of the areas you visit.

Gameplay
Combat is really engaging and fun. I like how the combos worked when attacking enemies. Instead of a top-down perspective similar to games like Devil May Cry, it takes a third-person camera, where you are right behind Kratos. Despite this being my first God of War game, this gameplay change works very well and as mentioned before is really fun.

You will start out the game using Leviathan’s Axe which has ice-based powers that can be recalled at any time when thrown and is also used for puzzle solving. My favorite weapon out of the two has to be The Blades of Chaos, these are fire-based swords that can attack multiple enemies. Each of these weapons can be upgraded and have enchantments to them, which can provide stat bonuses or unique perks when it is selected and equipped.

Armor can also be upgraded and have up to three enchantment sockets to them. There are also upgrades that you can get from getting EXP, these can give you extra attacks of other special abilities.

Lots of upgrades to get for Kratos

Atreus also has a few upgrades that he can get as well, like extra arrow damage and can get access to light and shock arrows. Light arrows can weaken enemies and stun them while lighting arrows shock and paralyze them. Atreus can even help you in combat and help solve some puzzles, he is actually quite useful and not someone who is just there as a character.

There are some amazing bosses that you can go and fight, they are challenging and that’s what makes a boss fight legendary. My favorite fight has to be Hraezlyr, a dragon that can shoot lightning from its mouth. The fight was just outright fun and satisfying after beating it, though there are other great bosses throughout the game, and they do keep the hype up.

Kratos can enter a rage mode if his rage meter is at a certain length, if you played Devil May Cry and know about Dante’s Devil Trigger, think of it like that. Kratos gets increased attack damage and life steal when in this mode, it’s best used when you are in a sticky situation.

There are also a ton of secrets for you to find, some of them are upgrades to your weapons or armor, while some are for your health and rage meter. The game rewards you for going out of your way to finding things and is something that I myself really like.

There are two issues that I have with God of War. Now, I should note that these may be nitpicky to some. The first issue that I had was that I felt when I entered Alfheim, the game just seemed to slow down in terms of story. I guess moving all of these giant gemstones really killed it for me. The next issue will have to do with Kratos entering his rage mode. For some reason, Kratos will only use his fists in this state. Even with all of that combat knowledge, he never seemed to have made any attacks with Leviathan’s Axe or The Blades of Chaos.

Do note that these are issues that should not hold you back from buying this game, just two things worth mentioning.

Graphics and Performance
God of War is a very beautiful game, it’s colorful and really well done. Each area gives off that strong Norse Mythology vibe and you can really feel it throughout. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. I came across no issues while I was playing but I did come across some lag in one area, although that is due to the main engine of the game not being made for PC's.

Wow, now that looks very nice

Final Verdict
God of War is a fantastic game and something that I myself really enjoyed playing. The game is challenging, fun, and brimming with collectibles. It shows us what a triple AAA game should have, and it does it very well, kind of like Doom Eternal on how it delivered its content. If you are a fan of the GoW series or are starting out, this is a must-have at full price either on PS4 or PC.
You are going to join Life Needs a Little Sin for good quality reviews.... Boy

Xbox: Become the Master Chief in Halo on PC
PlayStation: Become Kratos in God of War on PC

Frankly, I was very concerned that this would be another bad port when I looked at the recommended spec sheet. I believe we all don’t want another launch version of Horizon: Zero Dawn. Now I am glad those concerns are needless. The game is fantastic in almost every technical aspect. Consistent framerates, great visuals/textures, exclusive Nvidia features and FSR are also included from day one. I don’t think I need to say the rest because it has already won countless awards.

My RTX 2080 + i7 9700k handles the game pretty well at high 1440p with consistent 75 FPS (no major fluctuation) without DLSS/FSR.Your PC should also do fine with proper settings to fit your playstyle. If you want more frame rates, you can always enable DLSS or FSR to do that without sacrificing too much quality. The mouse and keyboard is fluid enough to play the game, but I would recommend to use a gaming controller instead （Xbox controller should be good enough for most people, as you will not get any PlayStation exclusive feature by using a DualSense controller).

A side note: If you are using a PlayStation controller, right click God of War in your steam libary and select properties, then go to the controller section, you can disable the steam input there to have proper layouts of the controller.

A PC with GTX 1060 can run more than 30 FPS with all graphical settings at original level. Santa Monica’s claim of the spec can only run at 30 FPS is being too modest. Also, the port is mostly done by Jetpack Interactive! A shout out to them here and please send your apperication to them as well.

So.
After Bend Studio’s Days Gone, Santa Monica Studio’s God of War (2018) is another amazing Playstation hit title ported properly at launch. So what’s the reason not to buy if you are not very price sensitive?

9.5/10

不得不说，发售前看到推荐配置表的我，是比较担心这一作的移植质量的。相信大家已经不想再看到地平线：零之曙光的那种发售惨烈状况发生了。结果，皆大欢喜。它既有新显卡功能，FSR，高清晰材质，特效，以及稳定的帧数。

可喜可贺，我的RTX 2080+9700K在2K全高分辨率表现还算不错，不开DLSS或者FSR都能达到较为稳定的75FPS，没有任何大浮动，也没有任何恶性bug。根据自己的喜好来调整设置，相信大部分人的PC都应该能顺利游玩这款游戏。想要更多帧数，强烈建议开启FSR或者DLSS，两者都不会让游戏损失过多的画面质量。键鼠的响应度一如既往的优秀，但还是推荐拿一款手柄玩（因为没有给DualSense提供任何独占功能，所以对大部分人来说用Xbox手柄会非常合理）。

注：如果你用的是PlayStation的控制器，打开游戏库，右键战神并点击属性，在控制器栏目中关掉steam输入，就可以有正常的按键提示。

GTX 1060电脑能在全原始画面设置下运行高于30FPS，圣莫妮卡可以说是在推荐表里表现得相当谦虚了。另外主要制作这款移植的公司是Jetpack Interactive，请不要不意见把所有的光辉都只给圣莫妮卡！

结语
继Bend工作室的《往日不再》后，圣莫妮卡工作室的《战神》（2018）又是一款完美移植，并且发售期间包含超宽屏支持，DLSS，英伟达Reflex和FSR这些强力功能。除了穷，还剩下多少牵强的理由能阻挡你去送钱给索尼呢？

Sum-Up
In-depth analysis further down.

Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.

🟩 Pros	🟥 Cons
- Excellent combat system that has weight and a good variety of mechanics.

- Well-written story with generous amounts of optional, interesting lore.

- Near-flawless PC porting, with solid optimization and a wide options roster.

- Great amount of side activities and optional content worth your time.

- Punishing challenge level on Hard and especially Very Hard settings.	- Balance / scaling issues in early and late-game phases.

- A portion of post-endgame content is underwhelming.

- Some quality of life issues waste players' time unnecessarily.

- Disappointing final boss fight.

🟨 Bugs & Issues	🔧 Specs
- "True" fullscreen mode is unavailable: only borderless or windowed. FPS cap available.
- Rarely, controls may be unresponsive to execute certain actions.	- 3900X
- 2080Ti
- 32GB RAM
- SSD
- 1440p

Content & Replay Value:	Took me around 47 hours to complete GoW on "Give me a Challenge" (Hard) difficulty, completing all side content except for a few collectibles and Niflheim (to Hel with that garbage, seriously). The content is linear and there isn't really room for trying different "builds" or playstyles: despite the presence of NG+ mode, I rate the actual replay value as low.
Is it worth buying?	Yes. For an AAA production, the price of 50€ is fair for this content amount, and the quality good enough to justify a full-price purchase in most cases.
Verdict: Good
Rating Chart Here	A solid action-adventure title that proves fun and engaging despite several flaws. The father-and-son adventure of Kratos and Atreus hooks you hard until the end, and the gameplay revolving around it works well.


Several combat moves can trigger brutal executions, if enemy HP is low enough or if they're stunned. Spectacular and effective.

In-Depth
Father and Son
Kratos retired from a lifetime of battle and moved to Midgard, among the myth and legends of Norse folklore. The recent passing of his wife marks a critical moment in the insofar stern, cold relationship he has with his son Atreus, trained from infancy to follow the disciplined ways of his father despite his gentler heart; their relation is the pivotal point of the whole story. They must journey to the highest mountain to give the final farewell to their beloved - a task easier said than done, since Midgard is a land fraught with peril, home to cursed creatures and deadly magic. This setting is masterfully realized, both visually and lore-wise, with plenty of real references and lore about Norse gods, monsters and tales of old - of course it's still a videogame, so expect some "poetical licenses" - that make it all the more spectacular, though. Between damp caves, ancient ruins and even entirely different planes of existence, their journey will never be dull or uninteresting.

To the Nine Realms and Beyond
After a rather linear early game section, the duo will be able to explore Midgard freely, with the enormous Lake of Nine acting as a central hub towards several side areas. The map structure is semi-open world, with the very topography changing and opening previously inaccessible areas as certain story events unfold. Exploring is interesting, and brings a bounty of rewards often barred behind fights or puzzles: tough optional encounters, plentiful hidden chests, lore-related artifacts and more than a couple secret areas. Barring a couple instances, players are free to clear the main story at their own pace, and see most side content beforehand if they want to - borderline mandatory at higher difficulties, anyway. In many cases, backtracking once you're stronger or have acquired certain items will be necessary, in a metroidvania-like style of progression as far as optional content is concerned.


Enchantments, armor pieces and talismans give bonuses to different stats, allowing build customization to a certain extent.

Rusty, But Not Rusted Out
Both protagonists will be able to improve with two systems of progression, based on gear and XP alike. The former is gained from treasures, bosses, side-quests or crafted at a blacksmith using the materials gained from your adventures, then upgraded to unlock its true potential, mostly in the form of sockets for enchantments, which grant passive abilities and stats. The latter, XP, is gained from enemies and quests and used to purchase skills for Kratos and Atreus, enabling new combos, moves, combat feats and ways to deal with the enemy. Not only that, but XP can also be used to upgrade Runes, powerful spells equipped in each weapon that have a variety of unique effects, and will prove invaluable to fight the harder or more numerous foes.

Combat itself is fast-paced, mostly based on combos and on learning enemy weaknesses to certain elements, damage types while also memorizing their patterns of attack. Atreus and Kratos will work in an increasingly effective synergy, with the former being a support character using arrows, spells and the occasional melee move to aid his father. The enemy variety is good for the most part, and they hurt like hell too on higher difficulties, too bad the mini and optional bosses are heavily recycled and become stale soon enough. Between parries, blocks, dodges and finishers, spells and many different combos, there is enough mechanical variety for the combat to stay fresh until the end regardless.

A Whole Can of Butt Kicking
After clearing the story, there will be a sizable quantity of post-endgame content to clear, however not all of it is of the same quality. The Trials of Musplheim will have a set of 16 challenges each with unique modifiers or rules, like time limits or immortal enemies, that reward unique, powerful materials to make some of the best armors around. Niflheim, the realm of cursed mist, will have a roguelike-style labyrinth that constantly shifts, alongside a time limit: Kratos will have to get out alive in time, with as much loot as he can carry, or lose it all - I found this one to be tremendously grindy and boring, other than badly designed due to excessive RNG dependency. Last but not least the nine Valkyries compose the toughest bosses available, although several of them are half-recycled or copied from others, and the last one of them is more frustrating than enjoyable to fight against. Rewards are great in all cases, but sometimes not worth the pain.


Runic abilities unleash powerful spells that, in most cases, are effective against large enemy groups, but also leave Kratos vulnerable.

Even Gods Aren't Perfect
Both in early and late game the enemy scaling is totally off balance, resulting in overly-spongy foes that take literally dozens of hits, or careful kicking down cliffs when possible, to be defeated, while Kratos even with some of the best armor will die in just a couple of hits. The penalty for having inferior levels compared to an enemy is massive in terms of damage dealt and received, this can make some fights very annoying. The fact fast travel is one-way only until much later on forces unnecessary waste of time through already seen places, this coupled with a high amount of unskippable transition animations makes going anywhere quite a slog for a good while. Also, prepare pen and paper as a good number of "come back later" locations, chests and POIs won't be marked on your map, making it hard to remember them. The bare-handed fight style, unless in specific contexts, proves totally useless and is just worse than using a weapon, it has no place in the combat system 90% of the time and feels like a pointless addition.

For context, I've never played another God of War game, and I honestly had no interest in playing this one whatsoever. The only reason I picked this up is word-of-mouth, and, boy, did the game live up. From the story to the graphics, from the level design to the upgrades, this game is amazing. But what really makes it shine is the combat. There would have been so many ways to make this game go bad: cover shooting, hack-n-slash, too few types of enemies. The game doesn't do any of that. Combat is actually a challenge in this game, even on default difficulty. You can't stay back and shoot your way through, because enemies are too numerous and your "reload" isn't that fast. At the same time, you can't mindlessly jump into the fray, because you'll take to much damage and enemy shots tend to stun you. You truly and honestly have to plan and think on your feet: throw an axe, keep enemies in front of you, parry when you can, dodge when you have to, ask your partner for help, use "spells." If you're at all worried about this game's critical average being propped up by the presentation, don't. The combat in this game is rock solid. You WILL have fun with it.

I just finished 100 percenting God of War (it's been a week since release), and coming from someone who only had an Xbox pre-2019, this has to be one of the greatest games ever made. I remember being a little miffed after The Game Awards in 2018 because RDR2 lost GOTY to this game, but boy do I take that back. The immersive combat enables you to feel unlimited power, as if you could fight any monster no matter its size. The story is rich and well-paced, conveying themes of fatherhood, matricide, and abuse of power. Its lore is presented in ways which garner interest in the world with its connections to the story's plot. Another aspect this game nails is the characters, who are well-written and emotional, with their performances being topped off by A-List voice acting. Your companion doesn't feel like a useless npc that you have to keep alive, but rather a complex character with extremely useful abilities, contributing to the combat and puzzle solving mechanics. In terms of how it runs, this is a great port that runs really well (give me more Sony). I only wish that Kratos could climb faster. Otherwise, just put aside any outdated console wars mentality you might have and play it boy!

Never thought the PC verison would be so better than the PS version. Not to oversell, but the PC version is the definitive version of God of War. Truly superior to PS both in performance, framerate, fidelity and gameplay flow.

Played it on PS4 and loved it. One of the best story games i EVER played. Music, setting, gameplay, story.. everything just perfect. And now playing it again on PC. I hope so much that Ragnarok (second game) will release on PC aswell.
100% recommend playing this awesome adventure. Do it.

I was allways a fan of Mythologies , specialy Greek's and Norse. So i grew up with God Of War 1-3, and absolutely loved them all. and Sony did go in right direction as well with God Of War 4. This game truly deserved Game Of The Year award. Game is truly amazing, both in visual and story wise.

As a fan of the God of War franchise, this game was truly an amazing experience and is definitely one of the best games I've played.

The story: The story is a beautiful one. Kratos and his BOY Atreus set out on a journey to scatter the ashes of Atreus' mother Faye, at her dying request. This journey isn't as straightforward, as they are hunted by the Nordic gods, for reasons that become clear in the game. The story sees the growth of the father-son relationship, Kratos as an outsider who wants to put his past life behind, the growth of Atreus as a Warrior God and also the development towards a certain famed Nordic event, that will be revealed in the game.

The characters: The lead characters Kratos and Atreus have been depicted quite well, with their words and action always in line with their developing personalities. The side characters are a delight especially Mimir and the dwarves.

The combat: This is possibly my favorite part of the game. Due to the new camera which is just behind the shoulder of Kratos, each fight feels much more visceral. Unlike the previous installments in the franchise, combat here is strategic and requires planning. The weapon, skill and gear upgrades are all different and hence can be tailored according to the fighting style of the player, which I found particularly useful.

The visuals: Graphics in this game are an experience. The detail in the world and characters is breathtaking and really adds to the overall gaming experience.

Certainly a generation defining game, and definitely one of the greatest games I've ever played.

25 saatin ardından oyunu bitirdim ve şunu söyleyebilirim ki oyunda gerçekten hiçbir kusur yok. Müziklerinden sinematiklerin geçilemez olmasına sanat tasarımından savaş mekaniklerine dünyasına hikayesine karakter gelişimine oyunun her yönü kusursuz ve gerçekten mükemmel. 25 saatte hikayeye odaklanıp oynamış olsam da bir 25 saat daha Valkyrie'ler ve yan görevler için gömerim gibi duruyor. Kesinlikle öneriyorum indirim beklemenize bile gerek yok 330 TL'lik fiyatını bile her kuruşuyla hakediyor.

This game is well a masterpiece in my book it's breathtaking scenario in the background makes it feel alive, an example of this is the mountain's feel so visually amazing my eyes feel like heaven and man the serpent just minding it's own business towering over everything especially us! atmosphere is so wholesome and nice especially in Midgard just gets me in the mood to explore, all the seaweed, fish and eagles just add to it.

Gameplay/Combat = 5/5 The Combat is one of my favorite The leviathan axe is one of the most well built and designed weapons I have ever seen the technical combat is satisfying and fantastic all the ways you can beat an opponent is so good every hit/kill is satisfying the moves are easy to pull off but hard to master. You can create your own combos chain moves together with the runic attacks. Everything feels fluid and smooth top notch! btw I love parrying and dodging in this game soo fluid makes me feel like a God oh and Boi is the best sidekick blades of chaos is also Godlike

Story = 5/5 Story is amazing God of War tells a story of a Father and son going on a journey to bring there mums ashes to the highest peak of all the nine realms. How they bond through out the game is phenomenal. All the little moments when Boi and Kratos drinking alcohol together. Boi almost kills his father because of his ego Kratos forgives him but teaches him, tough love at the start kratos teaches him how to hunt calms Boi from a tantrum it just reminds me of my childhood life with my Dad I used to be a angry Boi my dad would always stick with me till the very end then I learned how to calm myself at this moments I just love this story perfect!

Character's = 5/5 Kratos development is Godlike from a angry enraged Spartan to a calm old Father. Atreus a naïve young and curious Boi.
Mimir the smartest man alive is a interesting character if his real I would want to talk with him in a café about life and such he is also a storyteller.
Brock the dwarf a very funny guy quirky, feisty personality who has a funny yet wholesome rivalry with Sindri his brother also a dwarf germaphobia his quite literally the exact opposite of Brock.
Freya a nice looking witch she helps Kratos in his journey also the lore behind her is interesting. Baldur the antagonist he is great his personality is complex his one of those antagonist where they are not evil just broken. btw the lore behind Brok and Sindri is worth researching about.

Exploration = 5/5 a lot of realms to explore and grind, collectibles are fun places are magical, side quest are brilliant lot of complex meaning behind all of them

Boss fights = 5/5 The first boss fight was by far my fav fighting against Baldur was fantastic every time you hit Baldur with a Godly strike sending him flying into a bunch of trees and rocks breaking them with flawless physics is just soo satisfying makes you feel like a God! the fights against the Valkyries where amazing but challenging took me 7hrs to beat Sigrun on GMGOW just pure satisfaction the dragon fight was just perfection soo badass and the last fight with Baldur was pure mayhem although they could tone down the trolls mini boss fight it was fun but they could have change to a different creature or something.
Masterpiece!!!
That's it from me, one last thing "BOI"

I'm someone who finds it hard to get really into a new game these days, and this one completely hooked me from the get go. Absolutely recommend this masterpiece.
My only complaint about the game is the lack of truly GIGANTIC boss fights, but I'm sure that will be ramped up for the sequel.

God of War was by far the best game released in 2018. However, even after 4 years have passed, I assure you, this game is still one of the must-play masterpieces you might want to try.

The combat is satisfyingly brutal and its boss fights are spectacular which makes the game irreplaceable in the same genre. Most importantly, even though it's been a while since the game has been released, the graphics still looks quite decent as it's ported to PC perfectly with improved visuals.

If you're worried because you've never played the prequels before, just know that you are OK. There are plenty of videos summarizing God of War Saga on YouTube and I think just watching one of them would be enough to enjoy the game.





2018 년에 출시한 타이틀 중 최고라는 찬사를 받았던 게임. 비록 출시 후 4년이 흘렀지만, 지금까지도 반드시 해봐야 하는 명작 게임 중 하나라고 자신있게 말할 수 있는 작품.

갓 오브 워의 시원시원한 전투, 스펙터클한 보스전은 동일 장르의 타 게임들로는 대체 불가한 별미라 할 수 있다. 게다가 출시일로부터 상당한 시간이 흐른 게임임에도 불구하고, 과거보다 향상된 비주얼과 함께 완벽에 가까운 PC 이식을 한 덕분인지, 그래픽 또한 현세대의 타 게임에 비교해도 꿇리지 않으니 이 또한 주목할만한 부분.

혹시나 이전 작들을 해보지 않아서 구매를 꺼리고 있다면 걱정 마시길. 갓 오브 워 사가를 요약한 영상은 유튜브에도 널리고 널렸으니, 이 중 하나를 감상하고 플레이 하는 것만으로도 게임을 즐기는데에는 충분할 것이다.

One of the top 5 best exclusive title to have! If you have a Playstation 4 console you already made the first step in making the best decision, secondly if you still haven't experienced the exclusive titles on offer for PlayStation 4 then you way behind and of course God of war is among the best top 5. This game is more than just another best game described, it has to the the best game I have played by far! The emotions into the father and son adventure and bond gets you attached from the get go with thrilling battles of enemies there is never a dull moment whether you in battle or exploring, you just don't want to stop doing neither. Battles are epic and never easy if you really want to test your skills, and defeating that one enemy you have a challange with makes it more satisfying once you defeat it and you just want to keep looking for more powerful ones! The story is captivating well thought and doesn't feel like another game story to complete the game, you get really emotional attached and with that this makes it one of the best exclusive games! All I can say GET THE GAME!

The God of War series is one of Sony's great exclusive franchises. Now, with Sony trying to establish a presence on the PC, the famed action-adventure series has finally come to Steam. Or at least its most recent iteration has. Kratos, the fearsome Greek god who once wore the mantle of God of War, has escaped his violent past to Midgard. The earth of Norse legend. There, he starts a family and lives a quiet life in the woods. But Midgard has its own pantheon of gods, with their own agendas. The presence of a foreign god in their land can't stay unnoticed for long and the past Kratos is trying to forget is but one unfortunate encounter away.

The game begins on a sombre note. Kratos is performing the funeral rites for his recently deceased wife. Aiding him is his young son Atreus. This solemn affair serves as a good introduction to the difficult relationship Kratos has with his child. Kratos is a stern and distant father. Obviously haunted by his dark past, he keeps his son at arm's length. His wife, before dying, made them promise to scatter her ashes from the tallest peak in all the realms. Maybe in part she thought it would help them bond. Determined to fulfil her last wish, father and son embark on a grand adventure that will forever change them and the world around them.

Their emotionally challenging relationship and how it develops is one of the game's highlights. The characterisation is excellent and fitting. Whenever their attitude towards one another shifts, it feels earned. Even when you feel like Atreus needs a good spanking, he does react as you would reasonably expect a kid his age to react. On the other end, we have Kratos, the masculine badass. Brimming with the toxic masculinity of all good 80s action stars. This is both a refreshing representation and very believable as a cause of friction. His taciturn stoicism, his emotionally guarded stance, they all place reasonable obstacles that don't allow his son to realise his father does love him.

Aside from the father and son dynamic, the game is a pretty classic action-adventure fare. It comes with a mechanically sound and fairly satisfying combat system. Some fairly bombastic action sequences. An interesting world based on Norse myth, full of lore tidbits to discover and things to learn. Perhaps most importantly, some absolutely beautiful vistas and many wonderfully fantastical locales to discover. The game does allow you to visit several realms, so there is a fair amount of variety. The world is further enhanced by the obviously high production values. The well-made graphics and sound. It does help I love a good exploration game too.

As far as complaints go, I really wouldn't say there is too much. The game can be a bit grindy, the best equipment requiring you to farm resources and do the new game plus. But it's also an optional stretch goal at most, meant to ensnare the most compulsive. A perhaps more serious complaint would be that the game can be overindulgent in its presentation and shows less respect for the player's time than it ought to. For example, fast travelling across and between realms is locked behind repetitive and time consuming sequences. The first few times they were interesting to watch, but after a while I just wished for a skip button.

All in all, this was a worthwhile experience. Generally speaking, I am quite happy to see Sony bring some of their big guns to the PC. We certainly need more high-budget, quality single-player games on the platform. Particularly those lacking loot boxes and other such monetisation nonsense. And yes, God of War is a good port of such a game. I certainly recommend it to all fans of single-player action-adventures, as well as Greek and Norse myth. Now let's see how long before the upcoming sequel hits Steam.

One of the things that makes God of War so good is the way it builds on its past. It isn't really a reboot but a sequel that evolves on the previous games in the series. Throughout the game we are reminded of Kratos' past it adds depth to his character, intrigue to his future, and tension to his relationships. In terms of visuals this is the best looking game I have seen. The story telling is among the best in any game, although the plot itself is a bit on the simple side. It is also the longest God of War game and nearly all of that time is well spent. There are a few weak areas that hold the game back though. While combat is good the movement through the game world is very limited and linear. The amount of free motion and interactivity is very limited for a modern game and I often found it confining. The game is among the best I have played in many areas and does only a few things poorly but its has just enough flaws to hold me back from giving it the top score.

Gameplay 8.5/10 - While I grew to love the combat by the end of the game I found it sluggish at first. At the start Kratos has very few abilities and his movements are quite slow. Thankfully as the game progresses more and more abilities are unlocked and the variety of combat becomes very good. All the abilities that are unlocked seamlessly work together to improve the combat experience, There are multiple difficulty options that can be changed at any time so you can set your pace if you want to focus on the story or the challenge. There are a lot of puzzles throughout the game and while I did find some of them to be a chore most were fun and there was enough variety to keep things interesting. Menu systems are a bit confusing at first, there are lots of options and upgrading gear is a bit counter intuitive. My biggest complaint with gameplay is that it is very confining. The areas you move through are mostly narrow paths. For a modern game it seemed extremely limited. Kratos cannot swim and almost all motion throughout the world is scripted.

Story/Progression 9.5/10 - The story telling is amazing. The dialog between the characters flows seamlessly throughout the entire experience without interruption or repetition. It really does feel like playing a movie. Last gen The Last of Us raised the standard of story telling in games and this gen God of War has taken it to the next level. The story nearly perfectly blends into the gameplay without ever feeling forced or unnatural and is paced very well. My only problem with the story is that the conclusion was a bit broken up and anti-climatic. Over all though, it is some of the best story telling any game.

World 8/10 - The world is beautiful and full of deep lore. Everything you encounter has meaning and thought put into it. It is a unique take on Norse Mythology and it brilliantly compliments the other games in the series. The world itself is a joy to experience but in term of interactivity it is quite limited. While the game appears large and open it is really just a lot of narrow pathways. Unlike games like the Witcher 3 or Horzion: Zero Dawn, there are many places you cannot go. It is not an open world or even open area. It is a beautifully decorated web of pathways. The world building is amazing but for a modern game I expect more freedom.

Characters 10/10 - Kratos has always been iconic but it the past he was kind of basic. This game transforms him from a mascot into a truly believable, deep and fleshed out character. What is so brilliant is that it does so without sacrificing who he was. His past defines his present in a natural way. He carries guilt in a subtle way and he is full of emotional conflict. He is a strong character but he has vulnerability. There are few better game characters. Atreus is a also very well developed and the relationship between the two works very well. While the cast is quite small compared to a game like the WItcher, the side characters are still well written and felt believable.

Visual Design 10/10 - The visuals speak for themselves, even without the PS4 Pro the game looks incredible. The level of detail is just amazing. Not only is it technically beautiful but artistically as well. Every area is designed with care. Each location has unique visual elements. The models, effects, and animations compliment each other to look even better than the cut scenes in past games. I have been waiting a long time for in gameplay to have cinematic appeal and God of War delivers that.

Sound Design 10/10 - Everything in the game sounds good but the voice acting is the standout, there is constant dialog throughout the game and I never once got sick of it because it is all so well delivered. Each character is perfectly captured by their voice. The soundtrack itself is also great and has its own style without ever being distracting. Sound effects were very satisfying in pretty much every area.

I learned a ton about Norse mythology, hit many things with a giant axe, and cried at the end. It looks and sounds beautiful. Combat hits HARD. 10/10 can't wait for the next one.

GOD TIER!!!!

Masterpiece 10/10

Holds up to the classics pretty well.

Combat is a cross between DMCV and Demon Souls.

The puzzles and open exploration are also pretty nice.

Feels a lot more casual unless you play on Give Me God of War.

Still has that epic feel though that no other series comes close to.

Now give us GOD OF WAR 1-3 and any of the spinoffs.

SONY? BLOODBORNE WHEN?!?

BOY!!! Are you not ready?

Literally ALL the reviews are "Overwhelmingly Positive" which clearly means that THE GAME IS A MASTERPIECE! (but most of you already knew that)


So why...WHY are you still reading through the reviews instead of buying it? PURCHASE AND EXPERIENCE IT!


I mean, don't you wanna be a lumberjack exploring an incredible map filled with collectibles and goodies while a strange kid trying to hunt deer is following you? Because that's what I've been doing so far AND I LOVE IT!


On a more serious note, though, the game is surprisingly very well optimized and we all know (especially those of you who've played it on PlayStation) that it has an amazing story, awesome music accompanied by some very talented voice acting, some really cool mechanics, neat animations and effects, stunning graphics and the list goes on!


50/10 - Seeing this "Father Of The Year Simulator" gem installed on my desktop made me shed a tear...I still can't believe it...the perfect game has been released for the perfect platform.


Now then, GIVE US EVERYTHING ELSE, SONY!!!


EDIT:

I spoke too soon when I said that this game is just a masterpiece. Oh no, no. This...this videogame is OUT OF THIS WORLD, and I LOVE IT!!!

A really good pc port of an amazing game. I had no bugs, lags, or crashes during my 51h playthrough. Square Enix should learn how to make ports like this. As for the game itself, it's brilliant.

Pros:
- Great story
- Likeable characters
- Very solid and fun gameplay
- Amazing voice-acting
- Astonishing art design and visuals
- Outstanding soundtrack

Cons:
- Lack of enemy and boss variety

Thanks, Santa Monica Studio for convincing Sony to release this masterpiece on pc! I hope to see Ragnarok on pc in the future as well.

BOY, if you told me a few years ago that I was going to one day play God of War on PC with an Xbox controller, I would've thought you've had a stroke and asked if you're feeling alright. I definitely did not see this one coming.

Solid 10/10 - Literally perfect game and a flawless PC port.

I went into the game blind and I am extremely pleasantly surprised! I don't really like games that have a lot of long cutscenes and very little exciting gameplay. Here, the exact opposite is the case. Within the first few hours the action was priority number one, I felt so much adrenaline in my body and the game totally captivated me. The battles are extremely action-packed, challenging and simply well done. The voice acting is also absolutely top notch.

I can only recommend the game so far, it plays great and I have nothing to complain about so far, it is just extremely fun and I am very impressed with the gameplay mechanics. There is so much detail in the game, there are always little puzzles to think about, there is always something optional to explore.

The game runs buttery smooth, looks fantastic - there's nothing wrong with the port at all, it's really great. And it's release day, release hour.

Remember Boy, with great power comes great responsibility.

Damn! It really is happening, isn’t it? Kratos is finally on Steam, and even though more Sony games are coming at a slow but sure pace, I can’t stop feeling that this is kind of crazy, I’m not going to talk too much about this because I’m sure I will mention this again once Uncharted is out but, this feels almost unbelievable,anyway, let’s talk about God of War (2018) and why it’s a big deal for me, it’s worth your time and money? Let's find out.

I must start saying I was not a big fan of the Greek saga, it never “clicked” on me and that’s why I never cared about it, however, when this was announced I saw enough changes to make me feel interested on the project but unfortunately I never jumped into it on console for one reason or another, but here we are and now I can finally say what I think about this half-sequel and half-reboot so let’s get this thing started.

Many years have passed since Kratos killed all the Olympians and arrived to northern lands where he formed a new family and started a new peaceful life, however our story begins when his wife dies and Kratos and his son, Atreus, must start a journey to fulfil a promise, however, this journey won’t be easy and they will face perils that will, once again, test Kratos but this time will also test his son, a journey through the nordic realms has started.

While this game makes direct references to the Greek saga, you don’t have to play those in order to enjoy this game as it’s both a direct sequel but also a soft-reboot that is pointing in a new direction for this specific saga, that being said, is the story worth your time?

Story is fundamentally similar to what happened in the Greek saga, Kratos will end up fighting gods and creatures from said mythology, however, this time we will find an older Kratos that acts completely different when facing conflict, a Kratos that wants to teach his son and strengthen their bound, which is the main topic in this adventure. Game is long but that’s something understandable for two reasons, first of all, the journey itself and all that throws at you: new mythology, characters. In general there’s a lot of new stuff to explore and it sure has the time needed to properly do it. Secondly, Kratos and Atreus, SSM made sure both characters had enough depth to build a more familiar narrative inside the main story which is a very interesting perspective as it’s the foundation for what it’s about to come in the future. Is Atreus ready to be a god? Is Kratos ready to talk about his past? Game will explore all these things and give us answers to those questions . One thing I like a lot is that this game has really heartwarming scenes like the wine one. It's comforting to see a more human Kratos after knowing all his past and where things are going.

At the end of the experience I thought pacing was good and all characters had what they deserved, main and secondary characters, all of them had their respective screen time and most importantly, from a personal point of view, the story is very appealing and makes this entry something completely different than its predecessors, where they failed, this one succeeded.

SSM not only nailed it with the story but also with visuals, it’s just STUNNING! A lot of people consider this as one of the best looking games from the PS4 catalog and trust me, this isn’t different on PC, it’s impressive and truly shows how far gaming has gone in terms of visuals.

God of War 2018 is easily one of the most ambitious games they have done, much like Naughty Dog, SSM has always been a top tier studio with their products. Environments, combats and set-pieces that are mind blowing and GOW '18 is no exception.

From Midgard to Jötunheim, we will visit both decadent but beautiful and vibrant Nordic realms, from a colourful and full of life forest to rusty and decaying structures, detritus from a past era. The level of detail is absolutely spectacular too. In general I would say that, if you like Norsen style, this game will be delightful for you at a visual level, it’s impressive.

Another amazing aspect of this game is the set-pieces and there are quite a few in here. I LOVE them because they usually are the most impressive moments. Sure they aren’t that interactive but in combination with the situation in place, well, truly jaw-dropping moments and very spectacular.

You know what’s also impressive? Music and sound design, so let’s talk about that one because there’s quite a lot to discuss in here too.

One of my favourite things from this title is the soundtrack. It makes you feel that something big is really happening around us with entities that are superior beings. McCreary has a very distinctive touch for this kind of scale of things and the orchestral choices are absolutely sublime for this action, let’s take “The Stranger” theme, starts slow and becomes something massive overtime, HOW AMAZING!

Chorus and orchestra are something that I always appreciate in products like this, nothing like kicking a god’s ass while a whole orchestra in crescendo is accompanying the moment.

But of course Soundtrack isn’t all here, sound design is something that I really love when done correctly and GOW sure does have some stunning moments, as a practical example we have Jörmungandr, the world serpent, his voice echoes like a mountain because he’s the size of a few mountains together, the sound of the beasts is something absolutely fantastic, perhaps this is my inner love for strong sounds in big creatures so it’s delightful to experience it on any game and this one is no exception.

That being said I think it’s about time we jump straight into the most important element of God of War, gameplay loop. It's something that was controversial when it was shown at first but as you will see, doubts quickly disappeared because this system is very interesting and deep.

Firstly, Game was played with KB+M and it was really nice.

Something that might surprise you is that Kratos can no longer jump, that’s right, all actions like jumping or climbing are semi-automatic and camera position is different compared to the original games, however, while at first you will probably think it’s slower and less exciting let me tell you that things get interesting overtime, once you unlock , numberless runes and get used to the combat system you will find it very satisfactory.

Upgrading your gear is important as it will unlock movements and that means creating better and more devastating combos, switching weapons from one to another in the middle of a combat will become more and more common and runes applied to those will help you facing different situations as you can change those runes whenever you want, this process might be tedious at first and there are so many potential combinations that it overwhelming and might end up saturating you, however, if you are going to explore how deep is the gameplay loop, this system will be your best ally in the long term.

Let’s not forget about Atreus as it will become more helpful the more we upgrade him too, his arrows can come in handy in certain tricky situations, it won’t win the battles by himself, Atreus is more like a companion turret that will stun enemies and inflict damage to them. By using Kratos combos in combination with Atreus some very spectacular combats might happen, which at the end of the day shows that God of War 2018 is still as brutal and not that different to the original saga in terms of combat and gameplay.

That’s about it, God of War 2018 is worth every penny and every second of your time in my most honest opinion. SSM did an stunning job here and they nailed it with the changes they did, I sure hope you give it a chance and enjoy it as much as I did, even if you are a big fan of the originals or a newcomer I don’t think you will find difficult to enjoy it so here’s hope you have an amazing experience.

I'd like to express my gratitude to Sony for giving us a PC port. I had been waiting for this game since its release on PS4 and I was able to get my hands on it. AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE.

Kudos to Christopher Judge for voicing Kratos so well!

One of the few games that actually has a good, captivating story where you actually root for the characters and don't wish for them to die in a car crash. Not only is it one of the best stories told in a video game, God of War is a great hack and slash with some big cinematic boss fights. A masterpiece.

Play it instead of reading this dude. You won't regret it.

Boy: What are we hunting?
Kratos: You are hunting deer.
Boy: Which way?
Kratos: In the direction of deer.

The growing relationship between Kratos and Atreus alone makes this worth your while. Add to that intense combat, rewarding exploration and an exceptional presentation and you know why this is considered a must-play by so many people.

All in all, a terrific port with a few strange little omissions. You can only cap the framerate at up to 120 fps, and it lacks a true fullscreen option - you can run it either windowed or in a borderless fullscreen window.

Other than that though, performance is great - I played on the ultra preset on an RTX 2070 Super and Ryzen 9 3900X at 1440p. It's a great game, and just feels incredible as a work of craftsmanship. It's seamlessly executed.

God of War is an epic action-adventure in the Nordic world of myths and legends.

A really good story driven experience. The journey that Kratos takes with his son isn't only about defeating mythical enemies, but also about growing up as a person. We are told that they are gods, but their flaws and how they overcome them is very relatable to humans. You'll feel like you've added another myth to this magical world after playing the game, much like the stories you'll hear from Mimir during your travels.

The combat takes some getting used to. To be effective, you'll need to manage dodging, blocking/parrying, runic attacks for which you'll need to remember and pull off key combos, with another set of runic attacks for the second weapon that you can change to later in the game all while firing arrows with Atreus. This isn't a big problem because the combat skills are introduced gradually and once you do get used to them, they really shine in boss battles, creating some fun fights. The thing that impressed me the most is how you can feel the weight and raw strength behind Kratos's attacks without them feeling sluggish. Fighting feels epic, but it is also brutal at times with ripping apart enemy bodies and crushing their heads in.

For the most part, it's an open world exploration with locations that will need to be revisited because they are locked behind some upgrade. It doesn't offer a lot of freedom in exploring the world nor does it feature a big world. Instead, it relies on not very hard puzzles and engaging cinematics to add well balanced variety. For smaller parts the level design is linear, focused more on story to deliver the proper emotions.

Difficulty isn't a big problem because the game gives you the option to collect materials, craft gear, improve your skills and revisit a fight instead of only leaving you frustrated to struggle and learn enemy attack patterns. The difficulty itself can also be lowered in the options even after starting the game.

For achievement hunters:
None of the achievements are missable due to the free roam after completing the game. Includes collectibles, some grind and challenging fights. All of It can be played on easy difficulty.

Genre: Hack & Slash/Open World

God of War original trilogy are the first games that really got me into gaming. I did play games before that as a kid, but I wasn't really gaming that much before them. However, when I got my ps2 back in 2010 I discovered these amazing games. I've beaten GoW and GoW2 around 8,9 times each back then. Then I rented ps3 to play God of War 3 for the first time, and it was spectacular. Even today in my opinion GoW3 is the best game in the franchise and one of my all-time favorite games. As for this game, I've already beaten it twice on ps4 before and it was a pretty good game, but for me, it definitely doesn't have the charm that previous games have.

After the events of the first three games, Kratos now lives somewhere in the north where Norse Gods rule. He is not as angry as he used to be, it seems like he has matured a lot and found his peace in the north. He has a son called Atreus and a wife who just died, and her last wish was for you to spread her ashes at the peak of the highest mountain. And that's what's happening in this game, this incredible journey to the top of the mountain. It will probably sound stupid to you when you first read it like this, but don't sweat, there is way more to this. As in all God of War games, expect that you will meet some gods on your way, it's a pretty cool journey, with a touching, emotional story about the bond between a son and his dad. The characters and acting are awesome, and later in the game, you will find 

Gameplay is amazing. First of all, your main weapon unlike in the previous game is a flying axe. You can throw it literally anywhere you want and call it back. You can upgrade your axe, attach special runes to it, which let you call some kind of magic attacks. What's also new are different armor sets that you can wear, and it wasn't possible to change your armor before. You can also attach some special items to your armor slots which will improve your stats, let you slow down time, and so on. So with your axe combined with all these runes and armors, you can do a lot of different combos, and they are awesome. You will also unlock some other weapon later, but I won't spoil you that. Atreus also helps you in combat a lot. While you are fighting your enemies, he will distract other enemies, and you can order him to shoot arrows and sometimes he will find health gems if you use the correct equipment. He is definitely a big help, and I pretty much spam his arrows all the time. You also have the ability to use rage, in which Kratos is pretty much invulnerable and you will fight using your fists and deal a lot of damage. The rage meter fills up as you are fighting. Camera angles are not as before, they are now zoomed way more and fights are slower in general. Difficulty-wise game is not really hard on normal, but on hard you will need to explore side stuff to be able to overcome your enemies. I didn't even try the hardest difficulty, so I can't say for sure.

So how's the world and side stuff? Well, the idea was cool, but I think that the execution wasn't the best. As you progress through the main story you will be able to access a few of the nine realms in Norse mythology. Most of the time you will spend in Midgard (the realm of men). While exploring side stuff you will be able to loot a lot of items, track your completion progress, fight strong Valkyries, and do some side quests. I was personally never fun of looting items, finding new gears, and so on, so I didn't really enjoy fighting while exploring. Side quests were pretty boring, so I just did them for completion. Fighting Valkyries was fun, and it was the hardest challenge in the game. I really enjoyed collecting artifacts, finding Odin's ravens, and so on. Aside from Midgard, you will also visit a few more realms, but two of them are just dungeons and combat trials, while 3 are story-related. None of these realms were particularly interesting to me, but they were fine.

Story bosses are mediocre. The first and last boss fights are excellent, but the rest of them are mostly fighting trolls, so I think that they aren't that good, except mentioned 2 and one more. Side bosses are a similar story except for Valkyries which are awesome. Took me 50 hours to 100% complete the game on hard, but I've already beaten the game before and I really took my time, so if you only want to focus on the main story with a bit of exploring t shouldn't take you more than 35 hours. If you specifically focus on the main story, you will probably be able to finish it in around 20-25 hours. Performance is okay I guess, it ran well, but not perfect. I had occasional stutters, but they didn't bother me.

Pros:
- Incredible gameplay
- Outstanding dialogue and acting
- Great story
- Amazing characters
- Touching bond between dad and his son
- Random Norse tales
- 100% completing areas was incredibly fun
-  is the perfect boss

Neutral:
- Story bosses are meh, but few are good, and Valkyries rock
- Pace was meh, a lot of filler content
- Performances are okay

Cons:
- World is mediocre. While having multiple realms was cool, it's mostly repetitive. Side realms are boring and uninspiring, wasted potential, which I hope will be improved in the next game
- I don't really think that this formula of "open world" really works with God of War, which was specifically a hack and slash game, in my opinion, it would be a much better game if developers focused on the main story like before while making difficulties more balanced, so we don't have to explore the side stuff to be able to beat harder difficulties, since it wasn't that interesting to me

Verdict:
God of War 2018 is really a great game, and I had a ton of fun with it while beating it three times. It's definitely one of the best God of War games out there and definitely my top 20 favorite games of all time, however, I think that God of War 3 is the best without a doubt. I would recommend this game to anyone who played these games before, and to people who didn't, however for the best experience you should play the original trilogy, or at least GoW3 cause it still looks awesome, and that game is a hack and slash masterpiece.

God Of War, yet another Sony Exclusive coming to PC and damn am I happy it did.
I played through God Of War before on PlayStation 4, with poppy joystick camera control and all, even then I thoroughly enjoyed the game. But having the option to play with mouse and keyboard on PC just upped the entertainment factor of the game a LOT!

I would highly recommend just about everyone to at the very least give the game a try. The throw and pull (summon back) mechanic of the Axe by itself is a fun enough mechanic to make playing the game fun but the game also has a fun world to explore, nice character progression and leveling, as well as enough collectibles and side activities to get a person to about 40 hours if your going for the 100% achievement.

The story is the bread and butter of the experience though, the gameplay could by itself have sold the experience, but what really makes the game amazing is the story, the world and the character development throughout the whole experience.

I really love that Sony is releasing more and more of their exclusives onto PC and can't wait for more of their catalogue to join us here. My next big want is Infamous, also a really good game with fun controls, story, and world, but just wasn't a 10/10 experience for me because I was forced to play with a controller.

So my overall opinion on God Of War is that it is an amazing game that deserves to be experienced by just about everyone, the story does continue off of the original series of games but you won't feel lost if you never played them (apart from literally 3 or so conversations). I rate God Of War 9.5/10!

There are only 7 games that I deem "Perfect". These games are masterclasses of their genre, so in tune to their studio's vision and message, they deliver a completely engrossing experience from start to finish. These games are the go-to for any who asks me ‘What game should I play?’

These are the best of the best of the best, and now one of them has broken free from it's console shackles, and been released on PC.

This game is about a father and his son, losing the most important person in their world, and dealing with the consequences of fulfilling her last wish. But, it’s also a game that stresses above all else, that it’s okay for things to change despite not being ready for it. It’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to actually feel some emotion or even nothing at all, but at the end of it all, you have to keep going. Just because someone’s story has come to an end, it doesn’t mean that the next chapter of yours suddenly stops being written.

Speaking of writing, God of War's narrative is so masterfully intertwined with its ever so satisfying gameplay. Everything here has a purpose in furthering the story of Kratos and Atreus. From the no cuts camera that gets you closer the action, to the new Norse setting that looks jaw dropping, to even the absolutely incredible performances from the whole cast especially, Christopher Judge, Sunny Suljic, Alistair Duncan and Robert Craighead that bring all these stunning characters to life. Even the weapons that you can wield are incredible. The axe that Kratos has, man what a thing of beauty!

Hats off to the animators that make this thing look like an utter beast when thrown and also to the sound designers that make it sound like a clunky, chunk of super steel worthy of a god. The hack and slash fighting is tight and fluid; it being a joy to pull off combos. In a word it’s fun. In more words, its visceral, brutal combos feel cathartic, both for me the player and by the looks of it, for Kratos too. You get the sense that him harnessing this anger and directing all this destructive force towards his enemies, is how he deals with his whole world crumbling around him and I empathise with the guy. In fact I’ve probably empathised with him the most out of any character from any game in the past few years.

Let me just reiterate that. The person in gaming that I’ve empathised the most with, is Kratos. The guy who, in previous games had an unquenchable thirst for blood, vengeance, and well, orgies. Heh, what a beautiful game Cory Balrog and his team at Santa Monica have created.

Please play this as soon as you can, it's Perfect.

Oh, and the PC port is brilliant too, with PC nice to haves like double re-bindable keys, Nvidia DLSS and actual decent Mouse + Keyboard bindings that work seamlessly from the very start, combined with fantastic optimisation with rock solid FPS.

And P.S. Sony? Now that you have not only the demand, but also the know how on making good PC ports, Bloodborne and Gran Turismo next please!

This game is stunning!
Is breath taking graphics and unbeatable gameplay are only a page in a massive book on things why this game is amazing.

The story is a magnificent compelling attribute to an already perfect game, the story draws you in by constantly keeping you on a train of cliff hangers and systems where it make you want to unlock other plots advancing the story, all the while making each and every advancement into the plot as fresh as the previous one.

The gritty nature of the story at heart is just a small layer shadowing the deeper lesson of understanding and acceptance of past actions.

The game play is utterly brilliant, the fighting mechanics and the abilities are unseen is a franchise about hack and slash, while still retaining the incredibly addictive playability of not only it’s own series but of any game genre of us kind. The blocking in this game doesn’t just defend you from an enemy’s attacks is allowed you to counter damaging them stunning them allowing you to follow up with a barrage of strikes from your weapon of choice.

The accessibility of progression in this title is irresistible the rewards that are given for complete side missions and main are more than fair, allowing you to upgrade and progress though a bewitching skill system. You also have your son as a side companion assisting you in battle as well as being a key character in the story having a major effect on the narrative. Your son Atreus can be used to attack enemies from a distance and be used to advance to new room and progress though levels and assists is tricky but fun puzzles.

The graphics are unbelievably beautiful, unseen I’m a game of this type. The miraculous terrain you travel is extremely realistic and vibrant, the surroundings are just down right prepossessing and gorgeous. The Nordic style of the environment is perfect for both combat and appealing to the eye. The water simulation in this game is a almost perfect example on how games have evolved from 2D side scroller to game that are unrecognizable from real life.

The attention to detail is unmatched, it’s clear nothing from graphics, gameplay to the story weren’t rushed. The musical score is also an absolute must when is come to setting the mood. The cinematography is on points making the game one continuous shot not cutting from one scene to the next, it creates a cinematic feeling putting in the actual perspective of the character. All around this game is extremely important in the advancements of game quality, and detail.

P.S. I have to also say that this PC port is stellar! We have great options and optimizations is fantastic!

What is God of War?
Well it's a tender tale of a boy and his father, with lots of flaming and frozen viscera flying about. You have a goal and things happen along the way. There are at least two blacksmith dwarfs, one witch, a very large snake, the most amiable de-bodified head in all of gaming history, one enormous frozen giant with a chisel through his skull, and a boatload of puzzles. Even puzzles on a boat. And moar stuff. And you get to punch this one dude a lot. And I do mean a lot.


I emphatically recommend. That's better than normal recommend.

Conor McGregor hassles a greek immigrant and his son.

A father and son hunt for some food, but they get heavily sidetracked. He gets head from nine different women and one man with help from his son.

This game is fantastic. A coming of age story featuring a boy leading his illiterate father through the world as they are hunted by a hipster with nonsense tattoos.

The game really makes you FEEL like a single father. 4 hours in and honestly one of the best games I’ve ever played… definitely worth a purchase. 10/10

So far, an excellent PC port. At 1440p on a 5600x/32gb/3070 system I'm getting 80-100fps with everything set to Ultra and DLSS Quality mode. The game also features Nvidia Reflex, which helps make the combat feel more responsive.
I can't really comment on the quality of the game itself since I only played the beginning on PS4, but all my friends who beat it had super positive things to say about it, so I assume I'll enjoy it as well.

Basically the reason I was forced to buy a PS4 Pro, its hard to believe that this Masterpiece would turn up on the PC.

Runs smooth on 1440P Ultra. The DLSS does cause a little image Sharpening issue with distant textures appearing blurry, which is noticeable if you have played this on 4K on the console. However, that doesnt take away the beauty of the game.

This also forced me to search for a mouse with Haptic feedback because that thump in your hand when you call back your axe, was so gratifying on the playstation remote.

I really hope the sales of this game tells Sony that platform walled gardens are no good.

Introduction:

This was first time I played any God of War game; I don't own any console or have owned before. So, when Sony Interactive Network released it on PC, I wanted to give it a try. The lore of this game is both set in Greek & Norse Mythology, I did have an idea of both because of watching various Movies & TV Shows about Ancient Greece and Vikings, As they both worshiped Greek & Norse Gods Respectively.

TL ; DR
Watch the Video Review Instead with the link below
GOD OF WAR REVIEW

Story:

The game is an amazing tale of Our protagonist Kratos the Spartan half God & & his son Atreus. This father son story starts off on the Death of Faye wife of Kratos and mother to Atreus & their journey to scatter her ashes on the highest peak of all the 9 nine realms, like all journeys it wasn't an easy one. The only downside for me personally that I found it confusing how the two Norse & Greek worlds were coinciding with one another. I mean it's more relatable when mythological worlds coincide with our real world.

The Story is 4.5 out of 5 for me.

Gameplay:

At the start, like all new games it was a learning curve for me because you are in a way controlling two characters at the same time, although Atreus seemed like an extra weight and a liability as he didn't have much of the skillset. But as the game progressed, he became very useful. I still have a hard time choosing between The Leviathan Axe & The Blades of Chaos, but will go for the Icy Axe because in the end you can throw it and it comes back like Thors Hammer. Although the blades have a large attack radius and do more damage but their utility is less as you can’t throw them.

The Gameplay is 4.5 out of 5 for me

Optimization & Visuals:

The PC port can be very tricky as the settings each user has are variable, I have an i9-9900k and a RTX 3070Ti, Run all my games at 4K. The Optimization and stability of a game are mostly judged during the initial release phase, I played it after 2.5 months of the PC launch. I found it to very perfect with no issues whatsoever. I am myself a huge graphics enthusiast the visuals of this game are mind blowing especially in some locations such as The Witch of the Woods.

The Optimization & Visuals is a solid 5 out of 5 for me.

Conclusion:

After the completion of this game, it was quite obvious there is going to be a sequel. I would highly RECOMMEND this game especially if you want the best of both worlds an enticing story with an immersive gameplay.

Overall, I would give GOD OF WAR a 4.75 out of 5.

I would be crazy if I am not recommend GOW lol

beautiful graphic, beautiful hack n slash combat, framerate performance could be better ( I hope they will improve it ) , the voice actors quality are top notch. not so great regional price tag

I don't mind pay 729K Indonesia rupiah if you release GOW ragnarok at the same day as PS5 version.

The following are my thoughts and impressions after completing version 1.0.11 of the PC version of God of War.
I haven’t been this engrossed in a game in a very long time. At its core, it is the tender relationship between a father and son, trying to make a connection after the loss of a wife/mother. Beautifully detailed locations like you find in Skyrim, but better, puzzle mechanics of the new Tomb Raider franchise, but better. All wrapped up in Norse mythology. My only complaint is that it is done.
This game will have my game of the year nomination in the next Steam awards!

One of the best AAA games of all time.

Pros;
- Graphics are a 10/10.
- Immersive environment that rewards exploration. Basically zero waste for environment used. No dead spots for exploration.
- Mechanics were extremely fun and addictive.
- Story is a 10/10.
- Over all, one of the most complete AAA games ever made.
- Tons of side quests that are well worth doing.

Con's;
- Combat was not as fluid as the general mechanics would suggest. For example, 4-5 enemies can chain attack you without any gaps allowing you to block. This makes combat appear at times disjointed or sloppy.
- If you 100% complete the game, you run out of dialogue which causes too many silent spots. I'll explain; as you travel around, the characters will talk to each other further expanding on the lore/environment. When this dialogue runs out, you feel as if they are far too silent. I would like things like this to be expanded in sequels.
- Everything I mentioned are nitpicky things.

Summary of the game.
- Main story takes maybe 20 hours or less if you do no side quests.
- Two endless mission types; a fog/mist world, and a hell world.
- Treasure hunt quests
- Save the Valkyries quest line (Most rewarding side quests)
- Search every area for Odin's Ravens.


All in all, this is one of the most polished AAA games of all time.

The best way I can describe my experience with this game is by paraphrasing something that Jim Cornette said:

"Just played God Of War 2018 from Sony Santa Monica. If you’ve been wondering, THIS is what AAA videogames could have ‘evolved’ into had they not been commandeered by film-school dropouts, exploitative publishers and 'Packaged Goods Industry' CEOs. A masterpiece of the true art of interactive entertainment. Kudos to the developers."

And kudos to the developers for optimising the game so that it can run on low-end hardware. I have an i3 processor with 4GB of VRAM and an SSD, and even with the graphics settings on 'Low' or 'Original' it's still one of the best-looking, best-playing games I've played on Steam so far (for reference, I've played games like Sekiro and Doom 2016 on Max settings).

Currently the game does not run properly on AMD GPUs, having your FPS ranging from 120+ to >30, back and forth, in the blink of an eye, just by moving the camera around, especially during the first action heavy segment of the game, feels unplayable. Graphical options having no effect on the performance at all.

Example #1 with metrics:

YouTube™ Video: God of War Performance 
Views: 675
Radeon 6800XT R7 3700X 32GB @3200Mhz Latest drivers with God of War support: 22.1.1

Example #2 with FPS hitches:

YouTube™ Video: God Of War Performance 2 
Views: 314
Radeon 6800XT R7 3700X 32GB @3200Mhz Driver version: 22.1.1


If you've got an AMD graphics cards, I suggest you wait for a fix. If you're running with Nvidia, go for it.

This game is a masterpiece and I loved every single second of the time I spent playing this game back when it released on PS4. Glad to have it on PC, but it's definitely not worth praise it's getting when it comes to the optimization/port of the game when viewed from AMD user's perspective.

Specs:

"Oh Boiiii, God of War (2018) is as beautiful as I remembered it!"
TLDR at the bottom

"Ohh boiii, Im your dad! I have to raise you now!"

In God of War you step into the shoes of Kratos the... well...the God of War. The game is loosely inspired by Norse mythology. Kratos and his son Atreus (not Andreas) start their journey to fulfill the last wish of Kratos' dead wife & Atreus' mother: Spreading her ashes at the highest peak of the nine realms. During that journey Kratos faces the task to raise his son, which actually isn't as easy as killing everything that moves.

The dynamic between the grumpy, mostly seemingly cold Kratos and Atreus, who wants to prove that he is as brave and a worthy son is well executed. Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic deliver a great and emotional performance. All the characters are well fleshed out and their motives are always clear and get proper character development over the duration of the game. Without spoiling anything, I can say that the story is a truly heartfelt one, that's worth the purchase alone!

"Boiiii, I teach you how to fight! It will be fun!"

While God of War (2018) is a way more cinematic experience than its predecessors, the combat system is well fleshed out and engaging: Each enemy type requires a different approach to expose their weaknesses. Kratos can use his equipped weapon to chain combos and use special attacks. You are also able to switch between different combat styles (fists, axe).

The combat ties well into the general gameplay loop, that consists of exploring the "semi-linear-open world" of Midgard and its different realms: The chests you open often require you to solve some sort of riddles, puzzles or tasks. New special light and heavy attack moves are often the reward, motivating you to also explore the areas of the game that are not tied to the main story! Having good equipment is also the key to beat the challenging bosses that might await you!

"Oh boiii, I see trees of green, Red roses too, grey mountains bloom...!"

The artistic execution of this game still holds up perfectly, even four years after the initial release of the game: The realms feature varied landscapes and atmospheric biomes that are a sight to behold! The PC version scales higher than the Playstations "Original"-preset. The character models and general animation quality also did not age a single bit. Exploring the world was one of the most fun things I experienced during my second playthrough after all those years!

"Ohh boiii, I got an eargasm!...oh wait you are too young for that, right!"

An important aspect in games, that should not be undervalued is the audio experience: Gladly God of War nails it. There are options to fine tune the audio mix (tip: give the music a bit more dominance!). The ambient sounds, and effect sounds deliver a rich and immersive atmosphere...and the dude who made the soundtrack is called "Bear"...obviously it is perfection then!

God of War (2018) delivers a heartfelt story, a fleshed out combat system set in a beautiful world that invites its players exploring every inch of it! The game did not age a bit and I enjoyed my playthrough on PC even more than the one I had back in the day on the Japanese Entertainment Apparatus Quattro!

Wrapped up my third and final playthrough, having previously completed God of War '18 on PS4 and then the Pro. Game still holds up tremendously well and remains an all-time favourite of mine.

A third outing highlights some of the more uneven qualities of the game; a bit too much time is spent exploring and running through mines, the combat system still feels a bit too stiff for its own good especially with enemies that can lock-on break, and only having one "series iconic enormous monster fight" and it not being particularly great is a downer.

But other than that it's a remarkably satisfying, beautifully constructed game that delicately balances adventure, action, exploration, and storytelling in such a way that all the moving parts feel like they're working together in total unison. The combat (aforementioned grievances aside) feels punchy and satisfying while encouraging combo and power diversity. It's outstandingly gorgeous and the score lingers well after its played. It has just the right amount of exploration secondary to action that strikes a tonal and play balance reminiscent of something like Ocarina of Time, with the mini hubs and side missions and general player driven pacing without being true open world. The story is a magnificent reframing of Kratos in such a way that his awfulness of the original games is paramount to his identity here. And it all culminates with one of my favourite finals in a video game.

There's plenty that Ragnarok can improve and expand on, and I'm keen to see just where it excels. But the potential to be better doesn't in any way detract from how great God of War '18 already is. It was well worth a revisit.

Welcome to the pc platform Kratos !

Amazing game, don't need to say more, you probably already know about how good this game is.
If not then let me tell you that this game is a masterpiece both in terms of graphics, story telling and gameplay.
It's also a pretty good pc port, it runs perfectly fine and looks absolutely gorgeous.
Now it would be nice if Sony can bring us Spiderman and The Last of Us Part II next.

Rating 9/10.

After playing the originals it seems clear how the they changed some stuff (i.e. kratos and gore) and at first I was worried but after playing it I can see that it was a necessary change for growth of kratos to be more than angry man and set up satisfying arc for him 9/10

The most recent game from the legendary God of War saga is finally on PC. Something I would never have expected to see with my own eyes. Not just that, but the PC port is genuinely well made. The game runs smooth with no stuttering and absolutely no problem with cutscene/gameplay transitions. There are a few drops here and there for me because of my CPU but the drops are not only rare but also almost unnoticeable compared to some other games where the frame drops can really hinder your experience

The gameplay feels smooth and responsive with mouse & keyboard but it is clear that the game was obviously designed with controllers in mind as I find it difficult to adjust all my keybinds to make it feel comfortable.

So far, I am more than impressed.

EDIT: I love how every other review is literally just talking about Bloodborne. Please make it happen Sony.

Absolutely love it so far, the game runs really well on ultra and looks great.
The music is amazing and makes me feel like I'm playing in a movie.

I've never played the previous games but had no problems understanding the story.
I love how much loot and collectibles there are in this game, I've not been bored for a second. I like to play games on easy if I can and in this game sometimes it was too easy, but I've reached an arena where I'm too weak and need to level/get more loot to finish it which makes it feel more rewarding. I also like how there's both ranged and close combat AND you have "boy" helping you who I find really helpful. I currently have 14h in this game and I'm not close to being fully done yet (as I like to get 100% in games) and can't wait to continue!

Really glad I decided to purchase this and that console-only games are coming to Steam.

-Come boy
-Yes sir!
This is how you address the father

Another PlayStation exclusive on PC? How cool is that. Finally Sony started using their brain and realized they're gonna get more money by making their game available elsewhere. Duh!
I've played previous three games and in my opinion this is one of the worst ones. But by saying that I don't mean it's a bad game, it's actually a good AAA game. Sony is one of the very few publishers who is still releasing quality AAA games.

So this time Kratos is not alone, he has a son Atreus and they venture forth to release mother's ashes. On their way they meet a lot of monsters and some characters (some of them being funny af). I usually don't talk about the story much because I don't like spoilers at all. But the story isn't anything to remember, just a simple, generic story.

Why is it one of the worst God of War games you ask? Well i'm used to fight big threatening monsters, titans or wide variety of mythical creatures. Here you won't find them. Besides enemy design is as generic as it could be. You get to fight only few enemies through the whole game. To give it more variety and pretend that the game has many types of monster to beat developers just changed colors of the enemies. There's zero variety, you'll be fighting same enemies for the whole game (except bosses). It's just lazy design.
Besides the game is based on Norse mythology this time so of course expect trolls...which all are the same. Of course there are valkyries, they act like super bosses (completely optional) and those are so much fun to fight. They're extremely difficult even on normal difficulty but also extremely fun to fight. But again all the valkyries look the same basically. At least they have different movesets.

Gameplay is pretty straightforward. You fight enemies, climb something and solve some simple puzzles.
This time the game tries to make an impression it's open world but it isn't. Again just bad design. Why? Because of the map and how those areas are structured. Map is the worst I have ever seen in gaming. It's useless piece of garbage and doesn't help you to navigate at all. Thankfully there's a very accurate gps system which will help you to get where you want.
Traveling somewhere quickly is a pain. Yes there are fast travel points, they are called gates. But you still often need to run through corridors, climb walls, etc. to get where you want to be. And the whole fast traveling process is just stupid. You go into a gate, then loading screen loads and you run in another world until loading ends. This was clearly done for consoles so that people would have something to do while the area is loading up. But I don't know why would they need to reinvent the wheel. The old good “click to travel here” system is good. No need to reinvent or fix something which isn't broken.

The world design from a visual standpoint is awesome. It really is. But you never feel like you can go anywhere you like. It's nowhere near open world. You get tiny areas, usually corridors, paths, etc. and that's it. I wish I had either more freedom or less freedom (like older games).

More criticism. Camera. I hate it. It's a third person camera which acts like first person. It's annoying. Again why invent some stupid camera system when other third person action games like Tomb Raider, Assassins Creed, Dark Souls and plenty of others work fine? I want free camera control and I don't want the main character's back to take 30% of my screen space.

Oh i'm on a roll here. What else do I hate? Censorship. GoW games were violent but this one is watered down. Why? It's still 18+. First, enemies don't have red blood anymore (except in some cases). Second, violent scenes are censored, the camera just pans away. Seriously? In previous games you could watch how Kratos tears the eye out and here you can't even see how Kratos severs the head. Why?

Ok ok enough. Good things? Combat. Holy f*** it's fun. You get different weapons, you have ranged attacks and you can use Atreus to help you. Combat is diverse, fast and requires you to use the whole arsenal. While it's quite simple it might be hard to master.
Gameplay is simply amazing. Maybe not as good as Horizon Zero Dawn but it's so satisfying and so good that it outweighs all the negatives. Slash through enemies, rip them apart, watch how Atreus fights along you, it feels so good.

You also can craft and upgrade weapons and armor. That applies to both Kratos and Atreus. For that you need various materials and when you get enough you get to upgrade or craft the gear.

But sadly even when it comes to gameplay I have to point out some negative things. Did you ever hear a term – collectathlon? Yes it's here. I see developers probably are a huge fans of Ubi***t. There are collectibles on every step, like insane amount of them. You pick up trash every 10 steps. Like that is not enough you hunt crows, those act as completely useless collectibles – you must find them and kill them. Why? I'm asking again WHY? Stop with that trash collecting crap already.

Graphics are very pretty. The locations look stunning artistically. Extremely cinematic presentation and also extremely atmospheric which makes you more immersed in this mythical world.
From a technical standpoint the graphics are a bit dated. The game still looks great, it's just that you clearly see its not a recent game. Nevertheless considering this is a console port it looks stunning.

The port quality and performance is outstanding. The game runs smooth as silk maxed out without DLSS. The optimization is amazing. And for those with weaker PC's you can enable DLSS for that fps boost.
Like that is not enough, this game supports ultrawide out of the box. Developers went through the game once more and adapted everything to ultrawide. It looks stunning, every cut-scene, every transition to gameplay, everything looks so much better in ultrawide. This is one of the best ports ever.
Played on 5800x, rtx3080, 32gb @3440x1440.

The sound design is what it should be in a AAA title. It's outstanding. From voice acting to epic soundtrack. I have zero complaints. Kratos sounds tough and angry as always and other characters are voiced very well too. And then there's music. It's just awesome to hear. Not even for a second you will be bored by sounds.

Overall this is a good action game worth buying on sale. The world, the gameplay, graphics outweigh all the negatives. It may lack enemy variety and good story or character development but it's an action game and action in this is polished almost to perfection.

Pros

Awesome combat mechanics
Diverse and fluid combat always feels fresh
Great graphics and artistic design
Outstanding sound design
Beautiful world and atmosphere
Impressive port
Full ultrawide support

Cons

I'm gonna get burnt for this but I honestly don't at all see how this game has absolutely RAVING positive reviews. I loved the original series, and though i knew this was a departure, I still trusted SMS to deliver.

They didn't.

I don't understand why a series that was almost PURELY fast-paced action turned into the slowest, on-rail, hint-giving slog. Beyond that, the ratio of gameplay to cutscene/forced cinematic is preposterous. It never feels like the game starts because you are constantly being handheld in where to go and what to do. Your son will give you hints against your will and also at the speed of light, He does not care if you wanna try and solve a puzzle on your own. I'm about 5 hours in and it legitimately feels like I'm still in the tutorial phase. Again, 5 hours in and they have already re-used the same generic enemy and BOSS design MULTIPLE times, which for a AAA title is unacceptable IMO.

I did think the level-up/skill progression was cool, but in retrospect, it wasn't. It was just a linear way to gatekeep abilities that should've been available much sooner. Still, some of the abilities were actually interesting and that's what kept me there for the short time I was able to stomach it. The problem was the combat design and enemy design is just flat out boring. There was no real complexity or strategy, and I was playing on Give Me God Of War difficulty. The enemies are just meatsacks, you spam the same unsatisfying attacks on them, spam axe throw, and then run around to get better positioning because there 's always 8 of the exact same enemies in every encounter, and most of them fight the exact same way. There's also a million healthpacks just sprinkled everywhere during combat encounters to detract even further from the experience. Also, if you die during a combat encounter, you can't skip any cutscenes that came before it. So you WILL be rewatching them multiple times on the harder difficulties.

Music is good, graphics are good, story is whatever, gameplay is really low. I felt like I was in prison the entire time, and all I wanted to do was get out and be able to play the game. But the game never actually let me play.

One of the greatest stories ever told. Having already beaten the game on GmGoW on the PS4, buying it again on PC was part formality, part hoping for a future release of Bloodborne. That being said, what you have here is an impeccable game, full of heart, about a distant father and his son going on an adventure of their lifetime.

The strong characterisation, and the humanisation of Kratos from a 2D cookie cutter angry dude to a multi-faceted, nuanced man traumatised by his past has been deftly handled. If you're a returning fan, then you know how difficult it is for Kratos to come to terms with having another child, and just how terrified he would be about losing them. The Kratos you remember is still there, but instead of Calliope, he has Atreus to look after now. He's a stoic father, afraid of connecting with his son because he is terrified of Atreus finding out his true nature.

I can't, for the life of me, think of a single performance that was off in this game. Everyone, from Christopher Judge as Kratos, Sunny Suljic as Atreus, and Danielle Bisutti as Frejya was on point. The game oozes quality out of its every, lovingly designed, handcrafted levels.

The combat, while questionable at first, quickly picks up as you find better gear and unlock new skills. It feels like Kratos, who for the past 100 years has been hiding in the woods, away from the world, is slowly relearning the devastating force of nature he truly is. By the end of the game, you too will be bringing the wrath of the God of War down upon unsuspecting enemies.

There is a reason this game beat Red Dead Redemption 2 at the Game Awards in 2018. It is simply one of the best games ever made. You owe it to yourself to experience it.

I wish I could erase my mind and experience this journey again, for the very first time.

Phenomenal in every sense of the word. I finished God of War roughly two weeks ago and I’ve genuinely struggled since to work out how I can write a review and summarise how brilliant of a game this is. I feel like I’m doing a disservice to the industry in writing such few words for it, but damn, this is an absolute masterpiece.

32h on the clock, after already beating it on the PS4. And it still is a masterpiece, even years after its initial release.

there's not much to say that you couldn't read in other reviews either. so I just leave this here, saying that this is one of my favourite games from the last 5 years. The characters make this one an absolute blast, even if the story arch per se is not that exciting to begin with. but what happens to kratos and his son is just magnificent.

I only hope that Ragnarök will be released for steam as quickly as possible.

- GHOST OF SPARTA -

Game contains lot of mixed positive elements.
It is surprisingly respecting to origins.
Visuals presents lots of Nordic enviroments with mythologic style.
Cinematics are far beyond good. I never remember or it's been so long to remember that a game when I playing I wanted to skip any single cutscene.
Game puts you in a great mod. You feel like Kratos, you feel like a Mythologic God.
Pyshics, combat, exploring, gameplay, music are all perfect.
One of the most satisfying fighting experience definitely, effects and slow-mo sections completes the perfection.
It is hard to find any defect in a masterpiece like this.
I played like 50 hours but I got never bored a single minute.
If you play on higher difficulties you could feel like playing Souls series.
Story, presentation and cinematics were biggest point for me in this one.
I could easily recomenned this epic journey, it is an unique experience like Witcher 3.

You will feel the war inside of you.


I hope this review helps you out

Kind regards,
Mert.

Already beat this twice on PS and the third time around feels completely fresh because of this fantastic port. Hope Sony sticks with this standard of quality for future exclusives to pc. The game itself doesn't need a review at this point, its is an amazing and once in a lifetime game. and you need to play it

I'll review the game when I finished it, but so far it is buttery smooth, looks AMAZING, and plays AMAZING. This is the kind of singleplayer game that has you looking forward to your second playthrough long before you've completed your first one

This game was the best game I've played, start to finish the game is so involving and sucks you into it, even though the game was difficult and it truly did feel like a rewarding experience at the end. This is definitely my favorite game and I hope God of War 5 is just as good as this game.

I liked everything about this game, 100% recommend it to everyone especially if you enjoy RPGs and a good story. The only thing I would change is optimizing the game for open-world, there is still so much to explore but at times the game can feel linear. 10/10

Hey Sony! I bought this game and really enjoyed it... now here's a deal,

We receive Bloodborne and you receive a swimming pool filled with cash.

Serious review about the game

I really enjoyed it as an action adventure title that has a great narrative driving it and lore surrounding it.
Many OG GOW fans will agree that this one feels a bit toned down compared to GOW3, I agree I am one of them afterall. But I get it, Kratos is no longer the man he used to be and his life is different now, he has a REAL family now, his son. So it was an amazing experience nonetheless. The port was amazing on day one. Im a low-mid end gamer and didnot expect this port to be so so well optimised on day 1. SQUARE ENIX,
CD PROJEKT RED and ROCKSTAR STUDIOS should take notes lol.


The Gameplay was really good but you need to upgrade and use runes so that the mechanics don't feel stale later in the game. I would also be glad if they released GOW Ragnarok on PC aswell, hopefully within a year.

Keep up the Good work Sony

God of War boy, what else do you need ?

God of War is the latest and greatest Playstation exclusive that makes its way on PC. The sequel/reboot follows the story of our favorite spartan, Kratos. Haunted by the ghosts of his past, he is the same man we know and love from the previous games, but also changed, clearly trying to avoid past mistakes and teach his son to be something better than him. Changed is not only Kratos, but this 2018 reboot/sequel of God of War also makes some interesting and very clever changes that strip the original formula to its core and adapt it for a modern, narrative-driven and highly enjoyable action game.

Positives:
+ A compelling, nuanced story with heavy focus on narrative. One of the most interesting in the whole franchise.
+ New and improved combat system, that is the perfect mix of fun and complex at the same time. without being tedious.
+ Gear-based level system that features a wide variety of customization options that will help you immensely in harder battles. The Journey provides you with decent upgrades, both for weapons and armor, but if you go around the Lake of Nine in Midgard and the other realms, you will be greatly rewarded for your exploration.
+ Iconic weapons with an added sprinkle of customization options that add a great sense of new, while also staying true to the past games.
+ Stunning visuals, especially on the brand new PC port. Those with powerful hardware can take advantage of Native 4k and unlocked framerates.
+ Speaking about the PC port, I cannot forget to mention that it is nothing short of stellar. Any realistically decent PC that is not overkill can run this game smoothly with the original graphics preset. That is how the PS4 graphics are labelled on the PC port. Keeping in mind that the game looked stunning back on the PS4 when it released in 2018, I think no one would feel let down playing with this preset.

Negatives:
- The PC port lacks the "Exclusive Fullscreen" option, meaning you can only run in "Windowed" or "Borderless". Definitely nothing major at all, but I feel like mentioning it anyway, as I found it to be a very minor downside.
- Atreus shouts a lot in during combat. Lines like "watch out father", "behind you" will be heard a lot, especially if you fail a certain fight multiple times. It can get tedious quickly in such cases sometimes. Again, nothing that would impact the otherwise, excellent game.

Overall:
God of War (2018) is nothing short of a fantastic game. One of the best of the generation and now, one of my all-time favorite games. For me it was the second best game of 2018, surpassed only by Red Dead Redemption II. It would have definitely been my personal Game of the Year of 2018, had it not been for RDR 2 literally pushing the boundaries of video games as art. For describing the current game, however, there is nothing more I can say than "PERFECT". A concrete 10/10 without a doubt and a must-play game, whether you are a fan of the franchise or not.

I finished it. Took me about 2 months. Here're my thoughts:

Do not expect an epic tale. This is a very personal story of 4 characters, 2 dwarves and one severed head that could be over in 5-6 hours. Instead, it's filled with dozens of McGuffins that serve no other purpose than prolong the gameplay to 25 hours. "We gotta reach the point A. Oh, but the path is blocked by black fart. To pass it, we need a magical light-thing. Let's go get it!" Multiply this by 10 and you will get an idea. Over and over.

Another problem - bosses. The best, most epic and most memorable encounter in the game happens during the prologue. I'm not kidding. Also, over 50% of bosses are the same ogre-type enemy with giant totem, just reskinned (fire version / ice version...). The enemy varieny is lacking too, but bosses are what's this series is known for and I was very dissapointed here.

Invisible walls. Everywhere. The game is "on the rails" in the sense that you cannot move out of the way because the path is superficially carved for you. This game is not really a game, it's a movie where your every step is carefully controlled with occasional combat encounter where you get some freedom to how you want to approach the situation.

Puzzles everywhere but once again, I was getting annoyed by them the further I progressed. They're all the same - find a point where to throw your freezing axe, exploding red orbs and green energy blobs. There is a variety, but iif you expect cleverness á la Portal / Portal 2, you will be dissapointed.

I liked visceral combat and second half of the story. Music is great and relationship between main characters (and severed head) was amazing. But I expected much more from the hype and I literally forced myself to finish this. It's way too long, it's dragging and in the end it feels like a prologue to the "real" game.

Port review.

An actually well ported game, and the performance chart they've published didn't lie either - 3080, Ryzen 7 5800X and on my ultrawide (3440x1440) I am playing at stable 90+ FPS with everything maxed out. Not even microstutters that plagued previous ports by those devs, colour me impressed. For review of game, plenty of smarter people have done it already, I just waned to highlight that this is properly done PC port. Well done.

Besides the real Kratos not being in the game it's pretty good. The boss fights aren't as memorable as the first trilogy and the game is lacking the gory finishes but still a good play nonetheless and FYI TC Carson is Kratos

Performance:
- It's a wonderful port. No frame drops at all. Easily getting 100+ fps on Ryzen 5600X/RTX 3080/32 GB @ 1440p ULTRA(DLSS Disabled).


Issues:
- Series X controller when connected via Bluetooth is getting disconnected sporadically.

- Enabling DLSS is kinda crap for some reason(In terms of visual), even on quality preset.

Usually don't bother writing reviews but felt compelled to post something considering how smooth God of War ran for me. Aside from experiencing a memory leak after playing the game 5 hours straight, the game ran like an absolute dream.

- Excellent DLSS implementation with very minimal artifacting. In quality mode the game looked basically native and ran like butter.
- Excellent performance with uncapped framerate.
- Perfect ultrawide implementation, didn't notice any issues with cutscenes breaking as a result of the increased fov.
- Perfect controller support.

Overall this is the definitive version of the game and worthy of a buy.

In terms of cons:

- Mouse smoothing is very aggressive and can't be turned off, though this game was made for controller and is better enjoyed with one.
- Field of view is very restrictive, would've appreciated a slider.
- Directional audio is pretty bad, audio is basically permanently louder on the left speaker as Kratos stands on the left of the screen. Would like the audio to be more centred.

The above issues are nitpicky and if you want a good adventure game with tight combat just stop reading this review and buy it.

The best PS4 game is now on PC and its the best version available to play!
Higher fps is just the start of this wonderful PC port of God Of War. Although that is one thing I am loving of course, getting 95 to 100 fps with DLSS on and 75 fps with it off. This type of combat feels wonderful at 100fps!

As a HUGE fan of the earlier GOW games I was VERY unsure of how this new game in the series would turn out. I loved the games view and gameplay and story I was worried it might get lost. No worries though as the story and writing is wonderful and the combat is good to. Do i prefer the old combat, yeah.. but this is still very well done and combined with the amazing acting and story its a nice total package. I see some complain this game isn't open world or this and that but this fits this game and series perfectly to be more linear and focus on story and combat.

The game doesn't have much replay value but for this story focused style of game thats not a big deal, high quality storytelling here and the best game Sony has made during the PS4 generation. The PC port is also very well done, a nice improvement from Horizon Zero Dawn on PC on launch day (It took a handful of patches and many months to get it in the good shape its in now). What a wonderful surprise this game was, I remember being worried about this reboot and the Deus Ex reboot, but they both turned out wonderful and are good examples of how to reboot a series and do it well.


Postives:
- Great writing
- Good characters
- Fun combat
- Nice graphics
- Good audio and music
- Well done atmosphere
- Animations are amazingly well done
- Wonderfully paced
- PC version is well optimized
- Controls are well done
- Flawless back and forth between Cinematics and Gameplay
- The World design and creation is so well done

Negatives:
- Should have a FOV slider
- As much as I love the combat in this, part of me still misses the old games combat
- Not much replay value after you beat it

Get going and try this game BOY!

Ah, God of War. To finally play this game, and on PC to boot, feels almost surreal. I remember getting the original game for the PlayStation 2, it was in fact one of my first PS2 games, and I loved that game, I'd play it for hours trying to beat it, until I finally got a memory card and could save the game, but I digress. My point is, despite having played a single God of War game in my teenage years, the franchise still held a special place in my heart.

And so, here we are, at the latest entry, at least until Ragnarök comes. The game begins many years after Kratos' quest for revenge against the Greek pantheon has ended, with Kratos starting a new family in Midgard, realm of the Norse Gods. After his wife died, it's up to him and his son, Atreus, to fulfill her last wish: scatter her ashes from the top of the highest peak in the Nine Realms. Personally, I found it to be a very touching story, about a father bonding with his son, as they embark on a dangerous journey through mystical lands, and there's a great cast of supporting characters, all based around the Norse pantheon.

The gameplay differs a bit from what I remember in the original game. While that one seemed more stylish, this game seems to increase the brutality of the combat, as Kratos now uses an axe as his main weapon, which also has the power to generate ice. There's a decent variety of enemies to fight, from simple wolves and draugr (reanimated corpses) to trolls, elemental monsters, and even gods themselves (who act as the main bosses of the game), though I'll admit that by the end of the game, I'd have liked to see a couple new creatures. Besides combat, the game also features some puzzle sections, nothing too complicated, but it'll require some thought. Beyond that, there's also Atreus, Kratos' son, who carries a bow and can help you during combat encounters, following Kratos' commands (he can also help during certain puzzles).

The environments are great. From the relatively Earth-looking realm of Midgard, you'll travel to a couple more of the Nine Realms, like Alfheim, the Land of the Elves, and Helheim, the Land of the Dishonored Dead. Each of the realms you visit has its own unique style, reflecting on its nature and that of its inhabitants, although Midgard is by far the more expansive realm, serving as the main "hub" of the game. Even then, the game world is full of things to do and explore, and there's lots of collectibles and side quests to complete.

The visual department is also very good, as the graphic settings allow you to go further than the original level of detail from the PS4 release, with lots of custom options; gotta hand it to Sony, they know how to make good ports. Speaking of the port quality, I encountered no issues while playing, though I know that during the first week or so, there was a memory leak that affected players who travelled between realms a lot (it didn't affect me as I couldn't play that much during that first week); at any rate, they've been doing a good job at patching the game. As for the controls, the keyboard and mouse controls have a good default layout, though a quick tip: the game doesn't seem to tell you this, but keys 3 to 5 have special functions, for using certain special attacks that otherwise require combinations of keys.

Finally, the soundtrack is great, and it's a shame the game doesn't come with a separate download for it; I really love collecting and listening to game soundtracks, and I wouldn't mind having this one in my collection.

Well, I guess that's all I can say about God of War, and honestly, I think it's not enough. I definitely recommend this game, gotta hand it to Sony, they know how to make great stories in the gaming world, with an almost cinematic feeling. And I say that as a good thing; the "cinematic feeling" I speak of refers to the fact that the game is full of epic action, yet they still make you feel immersed in it, unlike other "cinematic" games that fill the story with cutscene after cutscene (not saying I don't enjoy that, but I like to feel like I'm part of the action, and not a spectator).

So yeah, I definitely recommend God of War. And Sony, keep the games coming to PC, and I'll keep buying them.

weird fps drops on AMD videocards to ~40-50 fps regardless of settings selected, fps drops happen when looking at certain direction, this drops feel very laggy.
Videocard is not fully utilized when the drops happen

Don't recommend buying it until it's fixed

Update: They fixed the mouse controls! Didn't even take that long. It feels much better now.

Old review:
Beware, mouse behaves like a joystick. There is a cap on how fast you can turn, and if you move the mouse fast, the camera will turn slowly. If you move the mouse slower, the camera will be faster.
Mouse sensitivity can also only be adjusted between 10 preset levels, from 1 to 10 in increments of 1.
Keyboard controls are okay, and the game lets you fully remap them. So that's a plus at least.
Performance is fine, but not great on a RX 6800. I get 80 FPS in 1440p Ultra.

I hope they will fix the mouse controls, this is Dark Souls 1 levels of awful.

Fantastic port of easily the best game of 2018. It improves on the Playstation version graphically and allows for high framerates up to 160fps. I had everything maxed and have been playing at a smooth 80+ fps through the opening hour or so. It provides a good assortment of PC options. I can't speak to the quality of the keyboard+mouse support, but if I had to guess I would recommend using a controller.

Speaking of, you want to see Playstation controls in-game while using a PS4/5 controller, make sure you have Playstation Configuration Support UNCHECKED in the Steam General Controller Settings; that option converts your controller to being a Steam controller, which prevents the game from detecting it as a PS controller.

There's not much to say about the game itself, it's amazing, go watch any review on it from 2018, then buy the game and have a great time.

was fun at first, but the combat is extremely repetitive and boring. Even when fighting bosses, its the same repetitive motions to disable any foe. I was kind of hoping I would be making my way through the Gods every so often, but the 11 hours I have played i have fought 2 bosses and 3 trolls. Trolls are exactly the same as eachother aside from a color and single ability.

I guess Dark Souls customized combat experience has ruined games like this. If you want to play a movie/game and hack away repetitive enemies in a repetitive fashion, buy it. If you're looking for something less basic, don't.

We've been pleased with another masterpiece on the greatest platform of all time. even though I've already beaten this game 3 times the PC version just plays way better than any of the console versions and I can't wait to 100% it all over again.

Sony now give us Bloodborne for gods sake, pretty please? Let's end this review with one of my favorite quotes.

Alright, I'm pretty much 10+ hours in and its amazing.

I'll say if you are a true God of War fan, theres a chance you won't enjoy this as it is more in tune to modern games and the Hack-N-Slash of the originals that Dante's Inferno even mimic is almost all gone overall. It is still quite a challenging experience overall, I normally play games on Hard to start with and almost never go lower but this one was still very tough and I had to lower it to balanced.

Great game if you are trying to test your skill at a fast pace combo hack-n-slash game with RPG like upgrading and stores.

Great game if you simply just want a great story too. Lots of fun exploration.
Graphics are beautiful. Game runs shockingly well too for a port on day 1 launch, I was semi worried it'd be like Horizon Zero Dawn at launch but nope, no stuttering and it isn't hard to achieve 60fps.

All in all, if you don't mind spending the triple A price of a new game despite it being a game from 2018, its an amazing game to buy - but if you are hesitant, wait for a sale but I'd suggest not passing up on this if you enjoy story focused action RPGs.

Also, to those of you who bought it and read this review....

As someone who played God of War on PS4, this PC port has a lot of quality of life improvements to the original.

On top of it generally being a great game and a fantastic reboot, I can't find any issues with the PC port outside of no option to adjust the FOV during gameplay (Although I do understand there's technicalities with that). Runs fantastic, and the ultrawide support which includes cutscenes is generally great and an added improvement for a game that prides itself on being cinematic and actually going the full way to support an aspect ratio commonly used in film.

A console to PC port where I don't have the temptation to look into fixes is already fantastic! Keep up the great work on the ports, Sony!

Absolutely a masterpiece. Love to see God of Wars on PC, has been limited to PS only for a while, guess this is a different realm now :)
The Graphics are as par as of PS quality and the gameplay is phenomenal.. If you love God of Wars series, this is a must buy and must play game.
Pro Tip: Try finishing the game 100% :D

Another masterpiece game. although I had many difficulties while playing the game such as being unable to activate Rage sometimes the prompt does not appear and many other issues. overall I liked the story, gameplay, dialogues, and everything I had the most fun after getting the blades of chaos. the boy Atreus is so lovely and cute. I just love him. and without him, I think the game would be so much dull and serious. he was a great addition to the game.

I have played and completed God of War multiple times, on the original PS4, the PS4 pro then when the 60fps 4k (checkerboard) patch came to the PS5 I played it again. It is such an amazing game, and close to the perfect game.

I picked it up for PC and it looks amazing and runs wonderful. It has a great DLSS implementation and cranking everything to max it looks better than it does on the PS5, and smooth.

The game itself is still amazing, the collectibles are fun, the story is great and well acted and written. The single cut camera throughout the game is super well done. I highly recommend God of War and look forward to more PC ports from Sony.

Performance on AMD hardware is very inconsistent. The game will be running 60 FPS in one second and then the most minor in scene changes and it chugs down to 35 FPS. I kind of just took it on the chin for a while but decided to put my playthrough on hold until a patch resolving this issue was released. The game devs say they have found the problem, but that was a month ago and there hasn't been any communication as far as their progress.
God of War really is a special game and I'm still happy I purchased it, just really wishing they could figure out this problem.

What can I say about this incredible game? This is an epic story from beginning to end with great gameplay and amazing graphics. The fighting never gets old due to being extremely satisfying. Also do the side missions because you will be awarded with various items that will make your character much stronger. This is a 10/10 easily one of the best games I played.

(Just over 100 hours played on the PS4 version)
In all my years, out of every game I have ever played, this game gets my highest praise and recommendation. It is phenomenal from start to finish and beyond; from the combat and build system to the storytelling, voice acting and cinematography. I could write a whole essay about it, but to keep this short...

This game is a genuine masterpiece, you will not regret buying it.

In a way, the God of War franchise was among the first of my story-driven, puzzle-solving, difficult hack and slash, action / adventure experiences as a kid. The others being Prince of Persia and Devil May Cry. I kinda grew up with them :)

Now, having not owned a PlayStation for the past 10 years or so, you can imagine how nostalgic I felt to finally jump into the GOW universe and play as Kratos once again... seeing him as a wiser, more calmer and loving father with many regrets of his past life, teaching his son Atreus the ways of a disciplined warrior, leading him down a path that ensures he won't turn into the monster that Kratos once was, a man driven by revenge and anger, was indeed a nice surprise, enough to make a grown man try to hold in a tear or two.. :')

But it makes sense for the continuation of his character arc and the story.. I'm so glad that Sony decided to port this 2018 GOTY masterpiece to PC, so I could play it and experience it for the first time, on the best platform with the best graphics and highest framerates!

On "Give Me God of War" difficulty, no less! :) After almost 100 hours of pure pain and stress, I finished the main story, looted every chest, found all collectables, did all the challenges, upgraded all my gear, defeated all the Valkyries and achieved 100% completion in all the Realms. And unlocked all achievements, naturally! I have to say, Dark Souls is a cakewalk compared to God of War on the highest difficulty.. (Yes, I'm looking at you, Sigrun, Queen of the Valkyries... it took me almost 4 hours to defeat her, and I came super prepared!)

I can't wait to try out New Game+ eventually for an even harder challenge (I may try playing the game with no HUD, as well!) , but first, after realising how much I missed this franchise, I may just have to find a way to re-play all the original games (GOW 1, 2 and 3) and re-live that nostalgia... It looks like Sony's streaming service "PlayStation Now" may be my answer... However, I would pay good money if they actually ported the original games to PC, too!

As for the game, the story is incredible, world is gorgeous, characters are very well done along with their voice acting. The combat is intense, and brutal. The music is incredible as well. This game is a masterpiece, that should be played by everyone. Use DLSS if you need better fps, cause they did a good job supporting that.

Byte-sized review	God of Chore
Review in under a minute	Enjoyable but rather uneven adventure. While I had fun with it, towards the end it became a bit of a chore to complete as I had started to find I was fast losing interest. Based on this I can't see myself pre-ordering Ragnarok - the sequel out this year - but I will definitely play it when it goes on a nice big discount. While the game looks good (you can see Sony threw oodles of money at it) and the combat quite visceral, I just couldn't warm to Kratos and Atreus shift into little obnoxious brat halfway through made me want to kick him off the mountain. Perhaps I should have played this during all the hype back in 2018 because I couldn't really see anything that stood out so much so that said to me "aah this is why it won Game of the Year at the 2018 Game Awards". Quite frankly I am surprised this one beat Red Dead Redemption 2 which it was up against for the Game of the Year award. Your mileage might differ but I was really expecting a lot more given all the awards and how everyone raved about this one. I just felt the ground it covered here was rather well-trodden and the disappointing constant re-use of enemies (just changing them a different colour to indicate a different status effect) got kind of old really fast. I was also surprised by how weak the script and story were (since Sony is well known to emphasise story in their single player games) but the game does excel with some of its action set pieces that look like they could have come out of the next $100 million Hollywood blockbuster.
One word or phrase to sum up the experience	Good but certainly nowhere near as good as what the review scores or awards indicated
Performance/Bug related incidents	One of the best PC ports we've had in years. Seems Sony learned from the performance woes Horizon Hero Dawn suffered from. An extensive list of graphical options exist for the user to tinker with if performance on their system needs tweaking. Ultra-wide monitors are also supported.
Similar to games	Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice; Rise of the Tomb Raider; Darksiders II
Suitable for	Teens and up
Score	★★★★★★★☆☆☆

It's been a long time since I played the original God of War trilogy on PS2/PS3, but I still have fond memories of them; especially the opening sequence of the third game. I'd little idea of what to expect going into this fresh take on the franchise, but I was left pretty satisfied by the end.

The worldbuilding & story range from brilliant to rather sadly average. The worldbuilding is exceptional, with so much lore & interesting tidbits scattered around varied locations & themes; I found myself on more than one occasion prolonging my trip towards a certain destination just to hear more well-told tales of Norse mythology. Sadly however, the story itself falls a bit flat. Character development is about as predictable & cliche as it gets, & the game fails to deliver a villain worth caring too much about. The idea of the story itself was solid, but the ending truly fell flat for me, & I was surprised the game was actually over when I finished it.

In comparison, the side content is fantastic, as it places less of an emphasis on story & more of an emphasis on exploration & gameplay, which are two areas where God of War truly shines. Combat feels meaty & impactful relatively early on, & only gets better as the story develops & more abilities are unlocked, and there are a LOT of abilities to unlock - Too many, arguably. Swapping between abilities to try them out became a bit tedious after a while, so I resorted to just finding a few I enjoyed & stuck with them throughout. Enemy variety is a weak point, but there's plenty to love about the combat; especially against the higher difficulty optional bosses. The right mix of visual flair, impact, & tightness make for an absolutely solid gameplay experience.

Visually, the environments are stunning, & there was never a point throughout where I was anything but thoroughly impressed with the world. It's quite easy to tell while looking at Kratos that this is a last-gen game, but that does little to detract from what is an otherwise mindblowingly beautiful game. The biggest achievement God of War manages though is the way it obfuscates loading screens through crawl spaces & other tricks to the point where the game is done in a SINGLE TAKE! No cutscenes, no loading screens - just pure immersion throughout. It's one of the things that makes Portal (& other Valve games) the masterpieces that they are, & it works incredibly well here.

In conclusion, God of War is an exceptional port of a very solid game, & Sony/Santa Monica deserve a lot of credit for what they've achieved here. The side content & worldbuilding are some of the best I've ever seen in a video game, but the main story & characters sadly fall well short of the mark. Combat is weighty & impactful while still feeling responsive, & the exploration is fun without ever feeling tedious. It's a definite recommendation, but temper your (story) expectations heading into it!

This is a short review based mostly on the console version, but also having made sure that it seems to be running decently on my PC. And according to most outlets and groups that have delved a lot deeper into the performance side of things it seems to be a pretty great port overall.

In terms of the game itself, in short it's a pretty great reboot to the God of War series. I never really liked the original God of War games since I found them pretty button-mashy action games. More often than not the game turned very mindless in how much you have to spam attacks. That's the thing this reboot adjusts, making the action more mindful and less button-mashy. Animations, both yours and the enemies', have a longer windup which means you have to take greater care with the timing of it all.

In terms of gameplay systems the game plays very much like a metroidvania game where you explore a hub-based "open-world", with a little itemization and abilities/skills to unlock. And you use various abilities which you unlock across the story to be able to access newer and newer areas. It's all very satisfying and enjoyable.

The story is decent enough, but where it shines is the acting of most of the characters. The acting, the animation and the photorealistic character models really gets you hooked. Some of them are really impressive, especially later on. And I hear there are plenty of emotional hooks for people that played there original games. Suffice to say, most of those have gone over my head, I think.

Other things left to mention, I guess are the various set pieces you encounter. Most of them are pretty incredible in terms of scale and location. Most of the locations are also especially beautiful, with gorgeous scenery. The whole game is a real treat for the eyes. And shockingly, it has native support for ultra-wide resolutions. So no needing to browse the internet for fan hacks that enable it.

It's also a pretty chunky game from what I remember, taking around 60-80h if I remember correctly, but I enjoyed it most of the time. If you're a completionist and want to unlock and collect everything (plus I seem to remember it also has an end-game item grind system which I never bothered much with) it can surely take you a lot more. But I think I didn't want to drag out the ending more than it was needed. Maybe on a second playthrough if I ever get the chance.

To conclude, I'd score it at a 8.5/10. It's a very competent AAA game with plenty to offer. And hopefully a sign of other great games that Sony might want to bring over. I'm still waiting for The Last of Us and Bloodborne on PC! It's been 6 years years already Sony! :(

This might just be the most heart-stoppingly, mind-blowingly mesmerising slice of digital artistry ever to be unleashed into the realms of cyberspace. It's nothing short of biblical: the essence of badass with one hell of a heart (and punch). If Dark Souls III and The Witcher III were to have a lovechild together... well, I'm sure Kratos would be more than happy to teach it how to become just like him.

If you're using an AMD card and planning to play in Ultrawide, I'd recommend trying to find more resources on how the game runs before purchasing. I'm using a card that should at least be able to play on High graphic settings at 60 fps, but unfortunately am having tons of trouble maintaining anything near a stable framerate; the entire first chapter of the game up through the first boss varied WILDLY depending on if I was outside, inside, in shadow, turning the camera around, standing next to a fire, fighting the boss...every new area I stepped in I noticed that the framerate range would be vastly different.

Here's hoping that some patches or new drivers release soon, since I'm really enjoying the game, but it's just too bad that the game is running pretty poorly overall.

Edit: My rig uses an RX 5700 XT (Overclocked edition), Ryzen 5 3600, and has 16 GB of ram. This ain't nearly enough to maintain a stable 60 fps throughout the opening minutes of the game, much less hours.

I just waited 1 looong year to play HITMAN 3 on steam with all unlockable gears from HITMAN 1 and 2 but just after the steam page launched i decided to buy this game..... I think there has never been a better choice: great PC port, the game runs smoothly.

so.... nice good job Santa Monica Studio

Game keeps crashing in the same place upon entering Sanctuary Grove, no help from technical support as of now, no workarounds, no way to progress. Also, no Dx12 or Vulkan support so AMD users should think long and hard before buying.
I will change this review once the issue is addressed.

A classic finally comes to the PC !
This game runs smoothly out of the box and the optimisation is nothing short of excellent.
I am also glad that all these games are getting released on good ol'steam cos #@$%^&! epic.
Sony has been really hitting it out of the ballpark these days with excellent ports like Days Gone and HZD.
I can't wait for other PS titles to come this platform, hoping for Infamous, Ghost of Tsushima and hopefully a Days Gone 2.

Buy this game now if you can afford it or grab it on a steam sale whenever possible, it is a beautiful experience.
10/10 Spartan dad simulator.

Boy,... just go buy and play it. <3 It was astounding, astonishingly done, absolutely enjoyed it. Could give 9.99/10. Just there are some nitpicks.

My favorite part was the Valkries (also loved the other NPCs as well). Being a Soul player I crave for proper boss battles. Idk for me, Valkries were the only bosses felt like real bosses, a proper challenge to some extent (although not flawless).

That brings me to the next point that aside from Valkries other mobs and bosses felt "mmkay". There are hardly any bosses even. I was waiting to see a vast variety of things as I progress through the story. Guess I might have had raised my hopes a bit too high. That only made me a lil sad cause this is a gem. Plot-wise they've bent those renowned Greek and Norse mythologies almost perfectly. Even though I didn't know Kratos' past I instantly fell in love with this portion of his journey.

Now the gameplay isn't bad or anything, It feels fluid just not as amazed as I was in the other parts. Again I just don't mind it, GOW went directly into my fav bucket. They showed exactly how a PC port should be delivered. Nice work. Thanks everyone who have put their effort to bring this to us. ❤️

subject to change : Now I saw the Ragnarok trailer, that was mmmwah. Another GOTY?

Magnificent. Absolutely spectacular.

First of all- it's about damn time Sony started releasing their top quality video games on PC. Games should be shared amongst all platforms, amongst all players. Also makes sense from a financial point of view for the companies involved.

I loved the original God of War trilogy. It's one of my absolute favorite video games series ever. One of just a few.
I hadn't played GoW since Ascension on the PS3. I then got into PC gaming shortly after the PS4 released, then, stopped following console game news.
When GoW was announced for PC, I became interested. Admittedly, I was hesitant about this game. Just kind of on edge about it. Boy... was I wrong.
This video game, is one of my all time favorites. It's absolutely fantastic. There is not one thing I can fault about this game.

When it comes to the combat, this iteration of GoW takes on the Souls type of combat, and it works very, very well here.
It's challenging for me to break the game down into sections, such as graphics, story, sound, and what not... as the only way to describe these things is that its magnificent.
This video game as a whole is just absolute top quality.
I'm not sure what the last game I played was, that I enjoyed every moment- adventuring around everywhere, sightseeing, checking everything out that the game offers.
I'm looking forward to the next iteration, and I hope it comes to PC sooner rather than later. Most likely Sony will have a one year exclusivity for their console, which would be fair enough. I will wait until Ragnarok releases on PC and I will buy it day one.
I haven't bought a game on day one in over five years. This is how beautiful this game is.

I hope to see more quality Sony video games on Steam. I'd love to see the original trilogy come to Steam, also.
I couldn't recommend this video game enough.

Another epic title in the God of War series. I was a bit skeptical at first because this one seemed very different from the first three but that isn't a bad thing. And there are a lot of similarities. Less hack-and-slash than the others and perhaps less "epic" but maybe that comes from being in Norse, instead of Greek, mythology. Fantastic story and very fun throughout.
Muspelheim and Nilfheim (both optional) were a bit too grindy though.

Uno de los mejores juegos del género hack n'slash en décadas. La fórmula algo quemada y poco original de los clásicos God of War da paso a un juego algo más pausado, mucho más técnico y equilibrado, que madura todo el género con un cambio de perspectiva, estilo y técnica que le sientan genial. Todo está bien medido y diseñado para que todas las habilidades y movimientos sean útiles, y la combinación de varios enemigos no implica machacar más veces el mismo botón o combo, sino alternar con habilidad las distintas posibilidades del combate.
La curva de aprendizaje es soberbia y cuando adquieres confianza con el sistema es cuando más se ponen a prueba las habilidades del jugador. Una jugabilidad maravillosa, a prueba de bombas.
A eso añadimos una exploración, puzles y retos que proporcionan un cambio de ritmo que le sienta genial y enriquece mucho la experiencia, un apartado técnico que puede merendarse a casi cualquier juego nuevo de 2021, y un guión e historia mucho más interesantes de lo habitual en la saga. Kratos no es el padre del año pero ahora mola mucho más que antes.
Lo tiene todo el juego.

You're either into this sort of thing or not and since I am into this sort of thing it worked out well for me. One of the best games on PlayStation and PersonalComputer, ever, but that sort of hyperbole can get one into trouble. Old fans should give this a shot if they already haven't 4 years later and new fans should take a look at the old games for something quite different. This is the story of a father and son, coming to grips with their past, who they are and getting ready for what lies ahead. Thankfully this journey will come to a close with Ragnarök, to avoid a seemingly mandatory fat-filled trilogy plaguing many a franchise. Stay true to the path and your journey will be well worth it.

I forgot to add that even if you meet the recommended GPU and memory requirements, it's probably wise to take a second look at your CPU as well. People are saying what a great port it is, but an i7 from 2016 might not be the best option for this.

👉 Get the game 15% OFF using code KRATOS on Gamesplanet: https://bit.ly/3rbNy3V I’m liking this new PC direction that PlayStation is going, so let's check out their newest port with my God of War PC...

Written review below!

I’m liking this new PC direction that PlayStation is going and since I never got to play this one on PS4, it’s about time I give it a look.

Note: Trimmed review to fit character limit, check video for full version!

PC Port
Put simply: the game works. No random fps drops, no crashes, no freezing, no stuttering, not even any bugs. I should note that this was with me running at max settings, 1440p, and a 155 fps cap on an RTX 3080 Ti. It's about the same quality we got with the Days Gone PC port - which was already nice enough.

Options-wise, there are the usuals like resolution, scaling, fps limit, and such, but some nice extras too like DLSS and FidelityFX Super Resolution. One setting that is missing is FOV though and this is one the game desperately needs.

Controls
I tested the rebindable keyboard and mouse controls and they were also fine, but I wasn’t the biggest fan of the mouse smoothing that appears to be present. Otherwise, controls on my Xbox Series X controller were flawless. The default layout is intuitive and the only thing I ended up changing was an accessibility option to keep sprint enabled at all times.

Combat
As for the game itself - also solid, but not completely without issue. Take the combat for example. It is MUCH different from the old God of War formula, but I quite like the new direction. It’s more focused, more weighty, and has more depth to it. You’ve got dodging, parrying, shield bashing, different weapon types with all sorts of combos, and an entire skill tree to unlock to enhance all of these.

But ultimately, the combat makes Kratos feel like an actual god. The previous games had their moments yeah, but in this one, each and every hit have that impact, that meatiness behind them - the enemies aren’t just these twigs to be knocked down.

Story
I went in expecting this big web of a plot, but got something a lot more grounded, more straightforward, and, yes, more focused in a way. As a whole, it’s a story about fatherhood, or really just growth in general. That’s because it’s two-sided, following Kratos’ growth as a father and attempts to live as a human and the coming of age of his son.

It’s engaging all the way through. The little bits of dialogue shared when traveling, Kratos’ occasional moments of wordless self-reflection, and the studio did a really good job seamlessly weaving all of this stuff into the gameplay. You’ll be in gameplay and then an outright cutscene and then back with some of the smoothest transitions I’ve seen in this genre. It makes the entire experience feel cinematic, which I know some people are not a fan of, but for a story-driven game like this, it’s pretty good.

It’s not a perfect story by any means, but I had a good time with it and it’s already got me excited to see where the sequel goes.

RPG Mechanics
Most of the RPG mechanics unfortunately feel entirely wasted in a game like this. Armor upgrades, talismans, enhancements, stats - they are very barebones and it’s often a waste of time to even upgrade them given you find new pieces every couple hours or so. Maybe on harder difficulties it might be worthwhile, but this is very obviously a game designed to tell a linear, cinematic story, so all this extra stuff unfortunately comes off as filler.

Puzzles and Exploration
The puzzles and overall exploration are also a bit weak. The puzzles, for example, are very basic and a lot of them task you with simply finding the correct spot to land an attack or destroy a set amount of runes to open a chest. There are a couple good ones in there, but the vast majority feel like tedium just for the sake of extending an area.

It was like the studio was divided into two when making the game: the A-team for the main story and combat and the B-team for the RPG mechanics, the exploration, and the side content. Some of it is fine (the Valkyrie fights are pretty cool for example), but I couldn’t help but notice a massive disconnect there and I can’t say I’m looking forward to doing much more of that side stuff now that I’ve completed the game.

Overall
God of War is not only a fun game itself, but runs flawlessly on PC and with some really nice visual and performance upgrades that make it now the definitive way to play. Higher framerate, higher resolutions, a mountain of customization options - it’s an all-around great port of an already great game. It may have some gameplay problems - the RPG mechanics, the puzzles, etc. - but I had a good time with it and would recommend it to those that like more story-driven experiences. Now please just give us Bloodborne.

A PC port that runs this well on day one? I'm seriously impressed.

Buttery-smooth frame pacing. Native 4K looks absolutely stunning. Ultra settings really make this game shine. And with all of that, so far I haven't had any issues getting a steady 60fps, beyond the occasional loading hiccup.

Exceptionally well done. 10/10 - Highly recommended.

BOY, I never expected to see this game release on PC. Ever since I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews and some great interviews involving the legend that is Cory Barlog, I hoped I would get to play this game one day. After waiting so long, I’m really happy that it was worth the wait. Be warned before reading ahead as some spoilers will be discussed.

God of War 2018 is a soft reboot, maintaining the canon of the previous games, whilst completely changing everything else; the gameplay, presentation and mythology are all new to this series. As someone who hasn’t played a game in the series before, I’m happy to report it’s a really excellent entry point. There are some moments which I only recognized the weight of because I did some research on the series’ history, but even without that knowledge, the story’s focus on the father-son dynamic between Kratos and Atreus makes it easy for anyone to feel from it. In essence, new players are similar to Atreus in their understanding, not knowing all about Kratos’ past and learning as they go along their journey. The laser-focus on their journey and relationship gives the game quite a unique structure; for example, the story doesn’t end when you reach the final boss, and even they don’t really have a major presence throughout the game. The narrative being told here is simultaneously both small in the goals of the main characters, but large in scale in terms of set-pieces, and the consequences characters have to face for their choices. It’s quite unique for a video game honestly, even if at its core, the narrative isn’t based on a novel concept.

The gameplay is brutal, challenging, and most importantly for me, offers substantial variety in terms of how you can approach each battle and the builds associated with that. Despite starting out with only one melee weapon, and a second appearing later on, combo variety and the uses these combos have makes it worthwhile to remember how to pull off most of the skill tree unlocks. Sending out a fire shockwave with the chaos blade chains, throwing the axe to stun a flying enemy, using your fists to break the stagger meter of a tougher foe; there’s a purpose for almost all of the moves on offer here, making it a game that is better played with this knowledge as opposed to spamming buttons to win. The options are almost overwhelming at times, and once that knowledge becomes second nature, you’ll always feel satisfied after overcoming a difficult fight.

The side content in this game is all quality, no filler. Not long after you enter the Lakes of Nine, you have the option to explore the area at your will, and there’s genuinely rewarding reasons for doing so, whether simply learning more about the world, or getting a quality enchantment that fits perfectly into your current build. There aren’t many side missions overall, but that results in them all being memorable, with areas of the map almost entirely reserved for these optional missions as they are not otherwise visited within the main campaign. There’s a solid number of collectibles, with the treasure hunts being particularly rewarding, and there’s even a bit of post-game content that’s worth engaging in, whether just to challenge yourself further or to improve your gear to tackle some additional bosses. The entire area in Niflheim felt like a simple yet classic, risk-reward grinding area for some of the best armour in the game, and the combat continued to remain fun even when dealing with some difficult encounters.

I know it’s probably considered blasphemy to criticize this game, but there are a couple of things I want to highlight which I hope will be better in Ragnarok:

- Most of the bosses in the game adopt a style-over-substance approach to their mechanics, meaning that while they look absolutely stunning, the encounters themselves aren’t much to write home about. Take the dragon fight for example; brilliant set-piece, but I was hoping to attack more than just its claws when taking it down. With this fight and others, it was also disappointing that you usually do not perform the final blow, that’s done for you in a cutscene; some may consider animations and visuals themselves to be the reward, but I’d personally prefer if such things were more interactive than they ended up being. The Valkyries are the exception to this; while I got my ass handed to by a few of them, especially Sigrun for a while, I look back on those fights enjoying them from both a mechanical and visual perspective.

- A couple of character-related points come to mind. Firstly, I really quite enjoyed Atreus as a character, however I felt that the stereotypical arrogant teenager dialect he switched into during the second mountain climb when it was revealed he is a god was both forced, and kind of jarring based on his character up to this point. I get that he’s only a kid, but he felt very mature for his age, wanting to do the best for his father despite his harsh and distant demeanour. I like the gameplay changes that temporarily resulted from this, losing control of his bow as Kratos loses control of his son, but I felt that the dialogue could have been handled a bit better. The second and final point relates to Freya being revealed as the mother of Baldur, and resulting from that, her dialogue coming across as the mother who just wanted to protect her son from harm, in this case in a quite literal sense. This certainly isn’t out of character, but the dialogue that came from this was again rather predictable, and contrasted heavily with the much more interesting, elusive god she was presented as before this point.

In the grand scheme of things however, these didn’t hurt my enjoyment of the game as a whole that much. Two other points I want to bring up:

- I played the game on Give Me a Challenge, and this is one of those games where it gets easier the more you upgrade your gear. The first few hours had some really spongey fights in them, but by around the fifth hour, I was powerful to the point where fights were still demanding, but I could complete them in decent time and had a lot of fun doing so. I would keep that in mind if you start on this difficulty, as yes it can take a while for things to start feeling satisfying.

- Performance was mostly excellent. I maintained 60fps on Original settings most of the time; anything above that, I didn’t really notice a visual difference that justified further performance decrease. There were some fights and areas that dropped to 50fps, which I think it mostly down to the sheer number of particle effects that can be present on the screen at one time, but also there were some areas where the drops didn’t make much sense. Some visually spectacular areas maintained 60fps perfectly fine, whereas some less impressive areas resulted in drops; I’m not sure if this is cause of my PC or the port itself, but I just wanted to mention it. The performance was consistent enough that I wouldn’t say this was a negative anyway.

Overall, whether you’re new to the series or not, or whether you’re a hardcore or casual action game fan, this game will have something for you to enjoy. The conclusion has me really excited for Ragnarök actually, and I hope that Sony will see the success of this port and bring it to PC much faster than the turnaround for some games. I would also like to see Sony put a bit more effort into game preservation and get the older games remastered; 2018 was the GOW game I was most interested in playing, but I’d love to try out the older titles at some point. This is definitely my favourite of the three first-party Sony ports that have released so far, and I’m looking forward to playing more of them down the road. 9/10.

A game made for the boys who played the originals and are now men with their own sons. Santa Monica has succeeded where so many other companies have failed. They made a game for the 90s and 2000s generation of gamers and did justice to the character and story we love. God of War connects with its fan base by growing with the player. When we played this as children, we enjoyed the hack & slash elements of the game and the rage and violence. As adults, we share in Kratos' hope and desire that our children become better men than we are. In an age of trite and meaningless games, this beautiful masterpiece blends engaging combat, thoughtful puzzles, and most importantly, a profoundly relevant and compelling story.

I know I don't need to write this review because the praises of this game that you have heard are true. But the fact that I am publishing this review should be enough to make you realise how amazing I found this game to be.

BOY OH BOY! The combat is dynamic and the Leviathan Axe is just the best weapon you could ever hope for in a game. The father-son dynamic between Kratos and Atreus is something that will keep you emotionally invested and even though it's not an open world game (even though it feels open), the game offers exploration of different regions you go to throughout your game.I was surprised by the performance it gave on my GTX 1650, it's really smooth.

As far as pricing goes, it's a bit too high for a four year old game, but well, it's worth it. If you're short on money right now, I would suggest you to wait for a sale and then go on the journey of your lifetime with BOY!

I've waited for so long to play some "God of War" games on PC ! The game is a true masterpiece tho i only played it for near 8 hours till now and i enjoyed every second of it. Combat system is nice, soundtrack is great, the graphics are outstanding i just can't get enough of the game 😃. Can't wait to see more of this game and i really hope that one day the'll add other series since i don't have console.

God of War was a masterpiece when it was released and raised the bar for what a game like it could be. It is one of the best games of that generation and sits somewhere in my top 10-20 best games of all time. This new PC port fires on all cylinders and elevates this already great game to further greatness. I experienced no issues with my entire playthrough, the game never crashed, I did not find any bugs or glitches, and the performance was always exactly what I expected out of the systems I played on. I can recommend both the game and the PC port highly enough.

It's very strange feeling that I play an iconic Sony game with XBOX controller.

This is not "Mash the button and you win" type of a game. Battle could be quite challenging especially in 'God of War' difficulty. There is no performance issue. Graphic is breathtaking and camera work is amazing. Story is dynamic and I'm absorbed. I don't want to stop playing but I need to sleep for now.

When God of War won GOTY I was furious because at the time I had exclusively played RDR2 for many hours and had not even considered God of War as a game to play, so as you can probably tell I was incredibly biased towards RDR2 because to me it felt as if no game could come close to the masterpiece that it was. I was baffled by the idea that a game as large and detailed as RDR2 had been beaten by some Playstation exclusive God of War game that, at the time, looked like it was just riding off of the hype-train that was a God of War comeback for the fans set in a world that was nothing to do with the Kratos we knew from previous games. However, with RDR2 being out for quite some time now and me feeling like I had milked the game dry of content, I decided to give God of War a go seeing as it was released for PC and test for myself if it was worthy of the GOTY title it was given. Let me tell you, I have never been so wrong in my life...

God of War does not only deserve the GOTY award it won, but in my opinion, it will also go down as one of the best games to EVER be released, and trust me, I do not make that claim lightly. The story of Kratos in a Norse mythology setting was an incredibly risky dice roll for the developers but I feel it not only worked, but launched the God of War series leagues above 99% of the gaming industry. I found myself captivated from the very start until the very end, constantly on the edge of my seat as Kratos and his son went on this grand adventure that I felt as if I was with them on the entire way. I would happily sit here and type out another 5 paragraphs worth of why this game is worth your money, but honestly, I think most people already know. I have spent time collecting every achievement and going to 100% completion in this game because of how passionate this game has made me feel towards it, and for a game in 2022 to do that to me is very rare let me tell you. My excitement for the next installment (Ragnarok I believe it is called?) is beyond measure.

Anyway... that was my God of War review, not really a deep dive into the technicality's of the game, more like a note of admiration for the experience that this game has been. Now you will have to excuse me, it seems a second playthrough is calling my name!

They say there's no such thing as "the perfect game". Ha..WRONG!

This game should be the pinnacle of single player games, a new standard for games development (for AAA games obviously)
The attention to details is just insane: from sound, music and graphics to voice acting and level design, story and gameplay mechanics. All these elements combined make this masterpiece into a experience everyone should go through. (you don't need to play the previous games to have an idea what's going on)
I highly recommend it!

The game certainly isn't without flaws, but many of them can be overlooked due to the stellar acting, encapsulating story and rewarding gameplay.

After 60 hours and %100 game completion, I can tell you how good this game feels, how good its combat and characters are and how good they implemented Norse mythology in the game. But I feel like you already know this, therefore I won't write about it and I will only say that this game has good f..king scenery all-around.

I can lick the grumpy old baldie's brown nipples and balls all day while I write this review but I'll keep it simple. This game is a solid 9/10.

I played it on PS4 and now im playing it again on PC. Im only 4 hours in at the point of writing this but I have yet to encounter any bugs and on Ultra the game looks amazing, way better than the consoles graphics. If your on the fence because youve never played any of the other God of Wars, dont worry, the story barely mentions or references older games and can be understood by anyone.

Very good game. I played this on the ps4 and bounced off it. I also almost did it here too.. but keep going. It is worth it.
The game opens up and is much better after the elf area.

The game runs great too.

Now THATS how you port a Console game. Played and completed the original on PS4 back in 2018. Same great game, but now runs at over 30fps and in 4k. If you've never played it on console. It's a must play.

Originally I played this game on PlayStation 4 PRO back on release in 2018 and, so far, the PC version has not disappointed. Beautifully crisp game, with buttery-smooth controls running at 120fps on the ultra settings with my RTX 3090 and intel core i9-12900k at 1440p.

An incredible story, with excellent voice acting and brutal and intense combat, even more so when set to the higher difficultie levels, combine that with a beautiful world and godly soundtrack and you have a true masterpiece of a game.

Let us hope sony keeps these PC ports coming. Cough...DEMON SOULS!!!

Wow!! This game is just incredible! I'm not going to list everything great about this game as it would take too long, all I can say is if you love your action/combat games then your gonna absolutely love this masterpiece.

Runs in 4K ultra at 60-70 fps on my 3080 and looks absolutely stunning! If your on the fence about purchasing, climb over and buy this game immediately. You will not be disappointed!

Hopefully we will get to see more PS exclusives pop up in the future!

Pretty kick-ass game with a unique take on Norse mythology. Back in 2018 I was skeptic about Kratos in the lands of the ice and snow, but good direction of the game made it.
This port is like homage to our childhoods, because growing up in an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the planet Earth, as kids many of us were unable to experience previous GoW entries on Playstation platform. Hell, Serbia still doesn't have its own PSN. Hopefully this move will inspire Sony to port more of those exclusive goodies to PC, if not for the fans, but for the sole profit of nostalgia. Looking forward to PC Ragnarok, as well as previous entries of the series.

In short:
Cutscenes and story are great, but I find myself sighing with boredom every time the game throws another group of the same enemies at me, or I discover that it's apparently time for yet another axe throw puzzle.

A masterpiece they say. I don't see it.
This game consists of three things. Fights, puzzles and cutscenes.
You walk from room to room and either it's a fight, a puzzle or a cutscene.
Combat is very repetitive. Chop or throw axe and tell the boy to shoot arrows. Same enemies and same finishers over and over.
Puzzles are very generic. Mostly throw axe at stuff in specific order.

I think I will try to finish the game though, since I like the story a lot.

I have a very good relationship with this game, whenever I feel down or shaken I tend to play it, it never fails to distract me from my current low state due to the enormous amount of puzzles, the strong rich story, and the impressive voice actors with their charismatic persona shining through their voices, C. Judging became my ultimate standard when comparing other male protagonist voice overs. If you think Geralt in Witcher had this unexplained effect on you, making you buy every single release from the witcher, or the beloved Keanu Reeves outstanding voice acting in cyberpunk, then think again! Judge is going to blow your mind.

What is even more rewarding is when you complete your first session and play again, you will become so strong and combat becomes a piece of cake.

I must say some of the puzzles were very difficult because of having more than multiple ones in one location, making it hard to remember even when you play the game all over again.

The graphics are wonderful!!! What a treat to my eyes.. I hated and loved the boy at the same time, my motherly instincts wanted to protect him at all costs but the devs really managed to keep him safe whenever there is a crazy trap by sliding him through a small opening, also the conversation between the head and my man Kratos were sometimes funny, especially when for instance he ask to be handled by the boy instead of the father in fear of being squished under the traps.

The Witch was bewitching ,I totally dig the voice acting, conversations, abilities, character appearance and effectiveness within the story.

I cannot wait for Ragnarok.

God of War on PC feels like the way it was meant to be played. As I am sure many of you already know, this game has a great story, characters, cinematography, seamless gameplay from start to finish, stunning graphics (elevated on PC) and world design to match, crisp voice acting, and the cherry on top... Phenomenal gameplay with loads of progression - unlockable skills, weapons, and other loot.

All of this is taken to another level with PC exclusive features. Everything from all-new higher graphical options, uncapped framerate, ultrawide support, DLSS, Reflex Low Latency, and more. Playing this game on a PC with a mouse and keyboard feels like an entirely new experience to me.

There are also a number of ways to play. While the game will nudge you in the direction of the story, there are plenty of opportunities to explore the semi-open areas. You can always choose to go back to locations at a later time as well if you missed anything or if a path was blocked. And for difficulty changes how you play this game dramatically. Want a super chill experience? Play on "Give Me a Story." Looking for a brutal game that will kick you while you're down? Play on "Give Me God of War."

God of War is such a well-rounded experience that I would recommend to anyone. - 10/10

This stands along with The Last of Us 2 as one of the best games I have ever played. Hell, it may well be the best game released in my lifetime. It's a technical marvel, a narrative masterpiece and an absolute joy to play. I only had a standard PS4 when I first played it, so to be able to relive the experience in 4k 60FPS, with everything cranked to ultra, is something very special. This is the pinnacle of gaming and the reason I work within game art. Highly recommend.

God of War was pleasantly excellent, and I'm glad to see playstation finally loosening the grips they have on their exclusives, I don’t want or expect Uncharted on PC or whatever, but I hope this starts a pattern of releasing older games onto PC platforms, especially with how hard it is to even see a PS5(or even PS4 for that matter) in stock nowadays.

God of War is a game that follows the now older and wiser, yet more vulnerable Kratos as you follow him and his son “Boy” living a very calm life in an extremely beautiful setting of Norse Mythology. And after a very quiet and somewhat understated opening you are thrown into this journey up a mountain. Of course there are dangers to face as you progress up the mountain. And this is where God of War comes into its element. As the tried and tested character dynamic of “Father + Son” tells a very very compelling story all with immaculate presentation. If you played through this game without opening a menu or pausing. There wouldn’t be a single loading screen. Which makes the story beats all that more interesting as they can happen at literally any time. Which is compounded by the gorgeous environments and setpieces the game has in store for you. This is legit one of the most amazing looking games I've played.

Beyond the excellent story God of War is carried by its combat mechanics, it feels extremely fluid and all moves that can be unlocked feel like a natural progression of the combat loop. New abilities you unlock fill in gaps in the combat loop that would be spent waiting for openings in enemies, most notably things like the shield breaker and parry really highlight how the combat becomes more fluid as you progress. And it also does something that very few games do which is making all moves you can do feel powerful in different aspects. Meaning that I was more inclined to try out and experiment vs. being locked into a single powerful attack over and over again. Obviously you CAN definitely just do a single good move the entire game, but enemy variety and difficulty with certain enemies will eventually test the limits of what that can do. The amount of variety for killing enemies is excellent as well. For example, you punch a dude until they are stunned, pull out your axe then decapitate them or slice off their arm. Or you enter rage mode and throw a boulder at a dude because you are awesome. Or maybe you kick a dude off a ledge. Some of my favorite moments in this combat loop was just trying to figure out ways to make the more difficult or “heavy” enemies get airborne. All the while an excellent OST is being played in the background, being drowned out by sounds of carnage on screen.

The juxtaposition of the softer story moments and the jaw dropping spectacles of gore and execution make the entire experience immensely compelling

The downsides of this experience being some clunky puzzle elements, an annoying fast travel system, tacked on RPG mechanics, and a lack of variety among the sub bosses. As well as an extremely irritating recurring enemy. but these issues are miniscule in the face of what the game gets right. Definitely worth the money even if you are only going to care about the story for its 20 hour runtime, although there are many sidequests and other things to do which will more than double that playtime. Well worth the $50 USD pricetag, a bargain in a world full of $70 USD base games with $80-100 USD "special editions" + DLC.

All the while, no microtransactions, no DLC, Nothing. Also while maintaining no bugs or crashes, nor performance issues on my RTX 2060 for a PORT of a playstation game. I played through at over 100 fps on "High" settings.

I'm tired of having to make accounts to play single player games. Or having to wait a year for people to iron out bugs. Or whatever else. God of War is excellent in terms of gameplay, story, and its market practices.

A refreshing reminder of an increasingly rare type of game. A game that is an actually complete and polished experience on purchase.


The bar for triple A titles has been moved for me. To say the least.

I certainly won’t add anything ground-breaking to the unanimous chorus of praises, just wanted to point out some things from my own perspective.

I’m grateful we don’t need additional launcher to play it. I admire the art style in every part of this title, and how it suits the game genre so well. Even the menus are done with utmost care to detail, including font or tiniest sound samples used for going in / backing out (whole audio is superb). It’s the same with frogs, crabs, all those smaller creatures wandering around when you walk through the world. Also cutscenes, seamlessly intertwined with gameplay, no black bars, immaculately immersive.

Worlds are not the biggest, but each certainly has that distinctive look. Aside graphics, I am amazed by the vertical design and the way puzzles are incorporated, sometimes possible to solve only when you progress through the main story.

The narrative itself flows naturally, successfully including bits and pieces of Greek and Nordic mythology, but also having that personal side to it. If you had at least a bit troubled relation with the father figure in your life, you’ll know what I mean. Because of all that, you may find yourself at 4 in the morning still playing.

The pinnacle for me here, though, is that what the game tells you to achieve in life (learn to strike a balance between physical strengths that you’ll gain and the mind that should knowingly control it), you must actually use as a tactic in your gameplay to be successful. Mindless charging at enemies won’t do, which I had a hard time with in the beginnings, and probably so will you. If this game is somewhat brilliant anywhere, it’s right here.

Love and appreciate gaming? Do yourself a big favour and buy this one. For me it places at the top, somewhere between Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2. Technically it plays awesome too. 9/10

PC Version is a gem.

if you missed out on the console version it's a must buy and even if you played on PS4 it's really worth a look because it's the best GoW version on the market.

there are enough reviews regarding gameplay and story out there so not going into that.

PLAY IT, BOY!

Overall performance is pretty good. I wouldn't say it's as good as Days Gone but is definitely better than Horizon Zero Dawn.

Stunning visuals and HDR work like a charm, enhancing colors and contrast even more. The game offers support to DLSS and FSR, DLSS is slightly better when it comes to both visual and performance, but FSR does great too.

NVIDIA Reflex did improve the experience when playing on my TV, which has a higher input lag than that of my monitor, but not so much.

Lack of exclusive fullscreen support is a tad bit annoying.

The mechanics are plain simple and the combat is fluid. Quick Time Events are gone, gore remains. Astonishing animations make it very satisfying to execute your enemy when prompted.

It's absolutely not a souls-like game.

9/10

I went into this God of War absolutely blind. I've never owned a console so I haven't played the previous games and though this game came out in 2018, I never really paid any attention to it since I never thought I'd end up playing this franchise. So I watched a recap video for the GOW franchise for the past games before jumping in here.. And let me tell you, that helps so much in adding context to character actions, reactions, dialogue. It also helps in understanding how Kratos is suddenly in Norse mythology when the past games were set in Greek mythos. While this is not necessary, I feel knowing Kratos's past adds so much more depth to this game.

This game is something special. You take a cookie cutter character from a hack and slash franchise and you ground that character by giving him depth. And there is so much nuance and character development here for both Kratos and his son. It is a wonderful tale about family and adventure. And there is just so much to explore in this game. A lot of it hidden away cleverly and a lot are blocked off by metroidvania mechanics where you have to revisit some areas with some skills to explore further. I finally understand how this game beat out Red Dead Redemption. The production quality, visuals, lore, music, voice acting are all magnificent. Every truly great game has moments which inspire chills. This game has plenty of them.
And the final reveal at the end was magnificent.

Pros:-
Story, Visuals, Music, Performance(Runs brilliantly on ultra+high on an old gtx 1070), Art, Lore, Animation, Character Development, Exploration.

Cons:-
Lack of boss variety/special boss encounters, some minor old game design elements(archaic armor and rune system, environment interactions etc). Honestly don't even read this section. There are no significant cons that will ruin/hamper the experience.

Rating - 9.5/10 ~ A Work of Art.

First things first. It's one of those games you can recommend to pretty much anyone. This short review focuses on technical issues of the game in general and PC port in particular. That aside, the game is great and it will be remembered.

You just want to play through the game one or two times? Yes, by all means. Pick it up during steam sale and give it a try.

I haven't played in 1.5 months, but nothing's changed since then. Over 1000 hours on PC alone in less than 5 months. Been playing since day one: over 30 full, true 100% playthroughs (Not in-game 100%. That counter is a joke), 100-120 dew runs. Lots of fun and I just want the devs to do the right thing and fix their game. I reiterate. It's not just a good game. It's a great game in a bad wrap.

From a technical standpoint the game isn't perfect. There are things like "Direct X12 is just beyond the scope of the project", so AMD users suffer from poor performance. It's mostly AMD's fault (though they've made some improvements recently. Radeon users would know better than I), but we're talking about a 2022 port. They should've tested this before releasing the game, right? It's not something you can just miss. Inability to disable DoF and TAA, change FoV, no walk toggle... you name it. I'm not that picky when it comes to stuff like that, but there's definitely a considerable amount of people who want to change these things. LoD is horrible, by the way. And there's no way to change that.

Classic mouse mode has negative acceleration, so they've added Precision mouse mode. But this mode lacks mouse smoothing option. No perfect solution for me, at least. Noticable texture sreaming regardless of graphics card (tested on RTX 3090, 3080 and GTX 1080 Ti. Plenty of VRAM and performance, but the game shows you super low res textures once in a while). Stutters when loading into new areas are noticable. The game is installed on two NVMe SSDs in RAID0. It doesn't use all this speed and uses less than 8 GB of RAM most of the time. There's no excuse for that. A couple of users reported about memory leaks. I don't have this issue, but you might.

They most likely took the latest PS build as a basis for PC port, which was the most logical decision. Too bad they didn't fix it completely. Yeah, it still has the same bugs as PS version.

Is it too much to ask? Game of this caliber should never settle for "good enough". They charge $50 for it. Why? The game came out over 4 years ago, they didn't want to work too hard on PC port and go the extra mile (according to credits, Jetpack Interactive is just 5 people). Not only they left those old bugs from PS verion unfixed, they also don't seem to care about technical issues on PC. The game has at least one downgrade (particles). And the new problems introduced in 1.0.9 update, of course.

So how is it different from any other game developer who typically drops support for their games after a year or so? Well, PC port came out on 14.01.22. That was 6.5 months ago. Last update was released on May 31. They don't support the game anymore. So if you have an issue you can't resolve, they won't help you. And it seems to me that the game is going to stay like that forever.

I have a pretty decent list of bugs. Almost all of them are reproducible and should be easy to pin down and fix. They just don't want to acknowledge the issues. Because then they'd have to fix them. So they turn a blind eye.

I'll change my review to positive as soon as they get their heads straight and at least fix the downgrade issues on PC. Including problems introduced in 1.0.9 update.

Port Quality: Sony undersold the requirements needed for this game. a GTX 1060 will definitely hit high 50s and low 60s in the "Original" graphics settings at 1080p, NOT the 30FPS that they mentioned in the requirements page. This game is extremely well optimized in terms of graphics. KB + M controls can be better but nothing too jarring. Audio quality is excellent as well.

Actual Review:
It's worth every god ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ penny out there. Nothing short of a masterpiece! Music, Voice Acting, Graphics, Gameplay, Story, everything just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hits.

2018'den bugüne halen en akıcı oyun deneyimlerinden birini sunuyor GoW. Her şey çok kararında, yerli yerinde verilmiş. Fazlasını istediğinde de eli boş bırakmıyor. Tadında bir açık dünya deneyimi, tadında bir mücadele imkanı, tadında bir keşif hissi ve arka plan anlatısı var. Ana hikaye ise insanı boğmadan yüksek bir yerden büyük şeyler anlatıyor; yas tutmaya, olgunluğa, tanrılığa, yakınlığa ve uzaklığa, sevgiye ve intikama dair. Ön planda Atreus'u yetiştirmeyi, büyütmeyi anlatırken aslında Kratos'un olgunlaşmasını ve değişimini izliyoruz. Umarım Ragnarök'te, yine bir sabah bir yabancının kapımızı çalmasıyla bu ikilinin maceralarına devam ederiz.

Let me tell you a story, I went to my dad in 2018 about buying me a PS4 so that our TV could be a SmartTV, LOL. he bought it I played God of War in it and sometimes he watches it. and now we both are eagerly waiting for God of War Ragnarök (Already Preorderd).

Apart from Our Story if you want to know about the Masterpiece, first of all, it's not a game it's an experience you would not like to miss. I bought this game two times (Ps4 and PC). IF you like Story-Driven Action games buy it even if it is full price because it's worth it.

And to the God of War team, Thank you and Please bring God of war Ragnarok to PC also, because after playing it on PC. that's a whole different experience. Everybody Should experience that for the first time together.

Expect way more than a normal action packed game.
The quality of the whole game is simply amazing. Of course this is a very violent game but the fighting flows so naturally. It's easy to get into without knowing advanced combos.

The stunning visuals are done with grandeur and scale. From huge bridges, snake like caverns, lifting up massive gates, Rooms filled with wonders and magic, it's all so well crafted. The environments are also complimented by incredible in-game cinematics. From small nuances in facial animations to the tone of the voices, it's all done with quality. The audio is all great and it never distracts from the game. It just blends in perfectly. The quality is superb and makes the game feel like a movie. Not surprisingly this feels like a big budget AAA game.

I don't know about the authenticity but the worldbuilding of Norse mythology is well interpreted. The story narrative is not as strong as in let's say Guardians of the Galaxy, but it's still is good. The action is the main attraction here.

A Screenshot of God of War

The game is linear for the most part. It opens up more after a few hours in, this permits optional quests, challenges await in some of those quests. The game can be difficult at some points(I was also playing with a broken controller) but there are plenty of checkpoints so failure is never a big setback. Multiple difficulty options awaits for those courageous enough. The game takes about 20 hours or so to complete the main story. Double that amount if you plan to do all the quests and achievements.

As for downsides, the tone of the story is very serious and tense, maybe this would be too much for some people. There are a fairly small amount of characters you interact with. Also, be prepared for a little bit of walking around the same parts.

Overall this is for action fans that are not the faint of heart.

Highly recommended

If anyone is unsure about buying this because of the fear of it being a bad port, please be rest assured, this is probably one of the best PC ports ever released.

This game is really cool. Story, gameplay, optimization, art, objectives. It's a great job for the Santa Monica studio. I Enjoyed it playing like I haven't done in a long time. I'm also happy with the people at Playstation who understood that for a true gamer there is no limit and no "exclusive" platform, thanks for bringing this to the PC environment. Well deserved is your success.

The only thing to improve. For me, after a point in the game, some items like the Great Crest of Flame, for example, should be easy to get and not tied to luck. I have completed Muspelhaim multiple times to get these items so I can upgrade the Valkyria Armor. It gets a bit repetitive.

If you're thinking on it, you're thinking too hard, boy. This probably one of the greatest hack and slash games I've played. So, do yourself a favor, get the game now, and become a god!

One of the best story, combat and best looking games i have ever played. Nothing will go wrong if you play this game. There's so much to do when you've completed the story, its a massive bonus. Sony completely knew what they were doing when they brought this to PC. This is a game you NEED to complete at 100%

I was so bored of gaming for months now and this game got me back. This is how games should be done. The environment is beautiful, the combat is so good, there's so much quests to do and maps to expore. The cutscenes and voice acting were immersive. Damn, everything is good about this game except the lock on target. This game is an experience worth your 50+ hours.

Excellent PC port, played through the entire game on the recommended PC specs for HIGH without any crashes or game breaking bugs, the only problem I ever had was once or twice my audio would stop for half a second when moving the camera during dialogue. Hopefully this becomes the norm for console to PC ports in the industry.

Good job Sony, looking forward to more ports like this.

Finished this game on PS4, had to buy it again on PC
One of the best games ever made, and a great port.

A must play, even if you're not familiar with the previous God of War games

A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece that's finally on PC. As a fan of the old trilogy and someone who doesn't own a PS4, I couldn't be more excited. Playing as a less bloodlusted and more settled down Kratos in a brand new mythology is lovely. His dynamic with his son is so beautifully written. The combat is so damn cool and feels so f-ing satisfying.

The game is also very well optimised and has no major bugs or other issues.

10/10

I've never played God of War before, never once seen a trailer, and never knew this was going to come onto PC.

After seeing reviews praising this game, searched a few review videos and just purchased it. The game on the PC lives up to what everyone has been saying. Polished, beautiful, and great gameplay so far. Running the game at 1440p getting approx 120fps on ultra performance.

The only thing I do want to note, I first tried playing keyboard and mouse, didn't feel right, mouse acceleration issues. Had to play with xbox controller. Aside from this, I don't have anything negative to say or have discovered during gameplay that I have encountered an issue.

There has been microstuttering issues during cut scenes from time to time, but I speculate it could be my specs (9700k+3080). No OC on my 9700k, running at 3.5ghz.
